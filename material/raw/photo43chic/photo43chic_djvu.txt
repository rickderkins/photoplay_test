SIDNEY 


WHO  could  go  to  Hell  quite  so  merrily , 
so  charmingly,  as  FREDRIC 
MARCH3  Here  he  plays,  as  no  one  else  could, 
the  brilliant,  irresponsible  playboy  reporter 
who  wins  society's  most  sought-after  heir- 
ess— but  doesn't  love  her  until  he  loses  her ! 
Perfect  as  he  was  in  "Dr.  Jekyll  &  Mr. 
Hyde",  he  shows  his  remarkable  versatil- 
ity in  playing  this  gay,  debonair,  insouci- 
ant character  so  well.

THOUGH  she  tried  her  best  to  keep 
their  marriage  from  going  the  way 
everyone  predicted  it  would — he  toyed 
with  Love  until  he  couldn't  have  it!  The 
story  was  tremendously  popular  as  a 
novel  and  newspaper  serial  under  the  title, 
"IJerry,  Take  Thee  Joan"  by  Cleo  Lucas. 
As  a  Paramount  Picture  MERRILY  WE 
GO  TO  HELL  is  not  only  "the  best  show 
in  town" — it's  one  of  the  very  best  of 
the  year!  See  it,  by  all  means! 


Sylvia  SIDNEY  at  last  gets  a  chance  to 
play  a  child  of  the  rich— and  appear  in 
the  gorgeous  clothes  she  can  wear  so  well. 
As  the  debutante  darling  of  the  "Four 
Hundred"  she  is  simply  exquisite,  and  her 
characterization  excels  anything  she  has 
ever  done  before.

THE  $25  LETTER 

Allow  me  to  present  a  two-second  drama 
entitled  "  Why  Movie  Stars  Get  Gray  Hair. " 

Act  I 
Scene:  Theater  Lobby. 

Characters:  Milly  and  Tilly,  two  blonde  ste- 
nographers. 
Time:  After  seeing  Billy  Haines  in  "Get- 

Rich-Quick  Wallingford. " 
Milly:    Why   don't    they   give   that   guy 
something   else    to   do   besides 
wisecrack?    I'm  sick  of  seeing 
him  as  a  smart  aleck  all  the  time. 
Tilly:     You  said  it.    All  his  pictures  are 
alike.  See  him  in  one  and  you've 
seen  him  in  all. 
Act  II 
Scene:  Same  as  Act  I. 

Characters:  Milly  and  Tilly. 
Time:  After  seeing  Billy  Haines  in  "Are 

You  Listening?-'         , 
Milly:    Why  do  you  suppose  they  put  him 
in  such  a  serious  role?    I  like 
him  better  as  a  smart  aleck 
Tilly:     Yeah!    Can  you  imagine?    Not  a 
smart  crack  in  the  whole  picture!

THE  $10  LETTER 

I  form  my  opinion  of  people  by  the  movies. 
In  conversation  I  deftly  turn  the  topic  toward 
the  screen.  The  films  liked  show  at  once  the 
calibre  of  (he  mind  behind  the  selections. 

One  of  my  fondest  friendships  was  formed  on 
a  mutual  appreciation  of  ''Outward  Boun.l'' 
and  "Disraeli .  "  Because  an  old  school  chum, 
whom  I  met  after  a  number  of  years'  separa- 
tion, raved  about  some  very  trashy  pictures,  it 
was  evident   that  we  had  drifted  apart. 

I  see  all  the  films,  good,  bad  and  indifferent, 
and  to  watch  a  number  of  people  react  differ- 


ently to  different  pictures  has  become  a  worth- 
while game.  Instead  of  "Tell  me  your  friends 
and  I'll  tell  you  what  you  are,''  I  offer,  "Tell 
me  your  favorite  films  and  I'll  know  what  you 
are ! " 

Jeannette  Lloyd,  Long  Island  City,  N.Y. 

THE  $5  LETTER 

I  am  a  college  girl  and  I  want  to  tell  you 
what  movies  mean  to  me  and  my  friends  here 
at  college.    After  classes  are  over,  they  rest 


WHEW!  What  a  lot  of  fuss  that 
"Grand  Hotel"  kicked  up. 
"It's  Garbo's  picture."  "It's  Craw- 
ford's picture."  "It  Belongs  to 
Barrymore!"  And  the  fight  was  on. 
Strangely  enough,  although  she  got 
lots  of  raves,  there  were  more  letters 
that  expressed  disappointment  in 
Garbo  than  letters  praising  her. 

But  when  the  smoke  of  battle 
cleared  away,  there  was  a  brand- 
new  screen  favorite  crowned  right 
under  our  noses.  Folks,  step  up  and 
make  a  court  bow  to  George  Raft — 
whose  work  in  "Dancers  in  the 
Dark"  and  "Scarface" 'set  him  right 
in  the  front  lines  along  with  Johnny 
Weissmuller. 

The  lad  who  played  in  "Wet 
Parade"  and  "The  Sin  of  Madelon 
Claud et,"  one  Robert  Young,  re- 
ceived some  very  nice  pats  on  the 
hack  and  lots  of  good  wishes. 

Karen  Motley's  acting  and  Marv 
Brian's  return  were  the  feminine 
sensations  this  mom  n.  "This  Is  the 
Night,"  "It's  Tough  to  Be  Famous" 
and  "The  Miracle  Man"  were 
highly  praised.  And  our  foreign 
mail  is  growing  by  leaps  and  bounds. 


our  minds  and  take  us  back  into  the  world  of 
reality  again. 

That  sounds  queer,  for  most  people  consider 
motion  pictures  as  an  outlet  for  illusion  rather 
than  realism.  But  at  college  we  become  easily 
unbalanced — too  many  text  books,  too  many 
lectures  dealing  with  theories,  until  we  arc  apt 
to  forget  what  human  beings  are  really  like. 

Motion  pictures  show  us  life  in  all  its  phases 
as  it  really  is,  better  than  books  do.  They  have 
a  true  intellectual  value  and  besides  being 
restful  and  entertaining,  they  teach  college 
students  many  things.

A  NEW  USE  FOR  HATPINS 

An  answer  to  a  maiden's  prayer  is  not  a 
beer-soaked  he-man  in  an  audience.  Desiring 
to  have  precious  entertainment  at  a  picture 
theater  one  Sunday  evening.  I  went  alone  to  a 
small  movie  house.  A  man.  with  no  intention 
of  seeing  the  picture,  but  desiring  a  close  and 
friendly  companion,  came  in  and  sat  beside  me. 
Being  both  conservative  and  crowded.  I  kept 
a  stiff  upper  lip,  squeezed  over  to  the  other 
side  of  my  seat  and  conquered. 

Finally  he  moved,  still  seeking  the  above 
mentioned  "'companion.'' 

This  happens  often  in  any  town.  What  is  a 
poor  girl  to  do?  I  would  not  have-  nerve  to 
raise  a  commotion,  and  does  a  manager  want 
to  rout  out  a  patron  of  any  sort?  It  is  a  dis- 
appointment to  be  so  disgustingly  distracted, 
as  a  good  picture  is  an  appreciated  recreation 
to  me.

CAN  HAVE  STARS"  REALTY 

I  used  to  \vondc  what  was  the  use  of  buying 
movie  magazines.  I  was  attracted  by  the 
pictures  of  the  stars  but  it  only  made  me  un- 
happy because  I  could  never  have  their  beauty 
and  charm. 


Now  I  have  a  different  viewpoint  and 
Photoplay's  swell  idea  of  publishing  beauty 

hints  of  the  stars,  and  articles  by  Hollywood 
experts,  has  changed  my  ideas.  Instead  of 
pining  around,  I  can  get  to  work  and  try  to 
accomplish  something.  Sylvia  has  made  me 
ashamed  of  myself  for  my  laziness  and  the 
beauty  hints  are  splendid.  Instead  of  just 
gazing  at  the  pictures  and  wishing  I  looked 
like  that,  I  can  g"et  something  from  them. 
Estelle  Bexxett,  Kansas  City,  Mo. 

'TAINT   TRUE,    MISS   McMANUS 

I  read  an  article  recently,  saying  that  Garbo 
was  dead  and  this  person  we  see  now  on  the 
screen  is  her  double.  They  say  she  did  not 
play  "Mata  Hari"  at  all.  Yet  she  seemed  the 
same  lovely  lady  of  "Anna  Christie.''  It  just 
couldn't  be  so.  But  still  the  thought  persists. 
Is  the  glamorous  Garbo  really  dead?  Is  that 
why  she  is  quitting?  Please  answer  the  cry  of 
a  troubled  soul! 

Lola  McManus,  Portland,  Ore. 

THE  LUKE- WARM  LETTER 

I  can  take  Garbo  or  leave  her  alone.  Some- 
times I  see  her  pictures,  sometimes  I  don't.  I 
neither  adore  her,  nor  do  I  dislike  her.  I'm 
sure  I  have  achieved  something  spectacular, 
by  writing  the  first  luke-warm  letter  about 
Garbo. 

Myra  Kinkle,  Oelwein,  Iowa. 

HE  MUST  BE  AN  ARCHITECT 

Can  it  be  that  the  well-known  depression 
has  hit  the  movie  companies?  I  noticed  the 
same  foyer  and  staircase  in  three  recent  films 
— "  Husband's  Holiday, "  "  This  Reckless  Age  " 
and  "Working  Girls." 

J.  Arden,  New  York  City. 

EH  WOT,  GARY,  OLD  BEAN? 

I  view  with  alarm  the  new  Gary  Cooper 
who  returns  to  Hollywood  with  all  the  ear- 
marks of  a  "perfect  gentleman."  Only  a 
monocle  is  lacking.  And  not  only  has  our  big 
he-man  of  the  open  spaces  become  an  English 
tailor's  perfect  specimen,  but  he  has  gone  John 
Barrymorish  on  us  and  is  toting  a  monkey. 

The  influence  of  countesses  and  elite  society 
is  so  manifest,  it  breaks  the  heart  of  one  who 
always  looked  to  Gary  to  be  the  real,  honest- 
to-gosh  cow-boy,  frontiersman,  trail  blazer.

FOR  SHAME,  MR.  BEERY 

I  have  always  admired  Wallace  Beery  and 
Will  Rogers,  but  since  they  indulged  in  that 
disgusting  burlesque  of  Greta  Garbo  I  shall 
feel  disgusted  every  time  I  see  their  faces  on 
the  screen.  Garbo  is  in  a  class  by  herself.  I 
admire  her  for  not  wanting  to  be  exploited  and 
to  get  up  at  openings  and  make  a  monkey  of 
herself. 

Beth  Leigh,  Long  Island,  N.  Y. 

I  wish  to  protest  violently.  I  have  just  read 
that  Wally  Beery  did  a  burlesque  of  Garbo  at 
the  opening  of  "Grand  Hotel."  I  do  not  like 
Garbo  and  never  have,  but  to  burlesque  her  in 
public  is  caddish.  If  Mr.  Beery  does  not  under- 
stand that  it  can  never  be  explained  to  him. 
Miss  S.  Boswei.l,  Baltimore,  Md. 

THE  "GRAND  HOTEL"  FIGHT 

I  think  "Grand  Hotel"  will  seriously  hurt 
Garbo's  career.  There  must  have  been  a  con- 
spiracy between  the  director,  cameraman  and 
editor.  At  times  she  is  made  to  express  an 
animation  which  is  so  extreme  that  it  is  most 
unnatural  to  her;  she  is  photographed  with 
inexcusable  carelessness  and  her  scenes  are  cut 
short  so  that  no  time  is  allowed  for  the  audience 
to  become  acquainted  with  or  understand  her 
character. 

Joan  Crawford  need  not  have  worried  about 
being  made  "the  goat."  Garbo  was  that,  but 
Crawford's  work  is  splendid,  though  Grit- 
sinskaya  should  have  been  the  outstanding 
character,  as  she  was  in  the  play. 

Charles  Sayre,  Chicago,  111. 

Garbo,  the  great  and  the  glamorous,  out- 
shines even  herself  in  "Grand  Hotel."  Sur- 
rounded by  stars  of  the  first  magnitude,  the 
glorious  Swedish  thoroughbred  outrides  her 
supporting  cast  and  wins  the  race  in  a  walk. 
Louise  Braun,  New  York  City. 


Each  charactei  i  m  to  be  molded  into  the 
plot  of   "Grand   Hotel,"  yet    I  is  an 

individual.      I    thought    that    Joan    Crawford 
should    be   given    the   victory   wreath.     She  is 
truly  remarkable.     Bui  SO  were  all  the  others. 
Jo  Awi  leveland,  Ohio. 

fust  want  to  send  in  my  ravings  about  Joan 
Crawford  in  "Grand  Hotel."   She  walked  away 
with  that  picture.    She's  got  Garbo  beat  a  mile. 
Ina  Blair,  .Mo.>s  Point,  Miss. 

My  highest  praise  for  the  fine  picture  "  Grand 
Hotel.''  The  whole  cast  was  splendid,  but  tl  e 
most  outstanding  and  glorious  of  them  all  is 
Greta  Garbo.  My  friends  agree  with  me. 
Garbo  is  the  supreme  star.  She  is  unforgettable 
as  Grusinskaya.

RAFTS  OF  PRAISE  FOR  GEORGE 

I  discovered  George  Raft  for  myself,  about 
a  year  ago  when  he  was  an  extra  on  the  screen. 
The  first  time  I  saw  him  I  knew  he  would  make 
good.  He  is  more  like  Valentino  in  looks  than 
any  other  actor.  In  a  very  short  time  lie  ought 
to  make  Clark  Gable  look  silly. 

S.  K.  Kresxf.e,  Cleveland,  Ohio. 

I  went  to  "Dancers  in  the  Dark"  to  see 
Miriam  Hopkins,  but  came  away  remembering 
a  fine,  outstanding  piece  of  work  by  a  new- 
comer, George  Raft.

'•SCARFACE" 

Why  does  the  censor  board  wish  to  ban  a 
great  picture  that  every  American  should  see? 
I  am  referring  to  the  greatest  gangster  picture 
ever  made,  "Scarface." 

George  Champiox,  Oakland,  Calif. 

"  Scarface  "  is  not  only  a  picture,  it's  modern 
history.  Almost  every  incident  is  something  I 
have  read  about,  discussed  with  others  and 
pondered  over.  Not  until  I  saw  "Scarface" 
did  I  really  come  to  realize  what  is  going  on 
in  gangland. 

Nancy  Vercellixi,  Torrington,  Conn. 

I  sincerely  think  the  government  owes 
Howard  Hughes  a  vote  of  thanks  instead  of 
criticism,  for  "Scarface."  It  gives  the  public 
such  a  realistic  portrayal  of  organized  crime. 

Mrs.  W.  S.  Bargetz,  Los  Angeles,  Calif.

"Why  didn't  Robert 
Young  get  the  credit 
he  deserved  in  'The 
Wet  Parade'?"  lots 
of  folks  shouted 
this  month.  In  fact, 
Robert  came  right 
next  to  George  Raft 
in  reader  acclaim. 
Here  you  see  Bob 
and  Dorothy  Jordan 
in  a  tense  moment 
from  the  widely 
discussed  picture. 
Good  work,  Bob  ! 


A  couple  of  cheers 
—  Mary  Brian  is 
back  and  knocking 
off  a  sophisticated 
performance  in 
"It's  Tough  To  Be 
Famous,"  which 
was  one  of  the 
favorite  flickers. 
Doug  Fairbanks, 
Jr.,  got  plenty  of 
pats  on  the  back, 
but  Mary's  return 
was  what  caused 
themost  excitement

Current   Pictures 


it  Indicates  photoplay  was  named  as  one  of  Hie  best  upon  its  month  of  review 


AFTER  TOMORROW— Fox— You  11  like  this 
because  it  is  clean,  it  has  charm  and  is  sincerely  acted 
by  Charlie  Farrell  and  Marian  Nixon.    (May) 

AIR  EAGLES— All-Star. —An  amusing  enough 
picture,  but  bigger  and  better  air  films  have  been 
made.     (April) 

•     ALIAS    THE    DOCTOR— First    National.— 
Now  it's  Richard  Barthelmess  who  glorifies  the 
medical  profession.     Rather  gruesome.     (April) 

ALMOST  MARRIED— Fox.— A  competent  cast, 
including  Ralph  Bellamy  and  Violet  Heming  (stage 
star),  struggle  valiantly  with  a  weak  story,  silly 
dialogue  and  careless  direction.    (Feb.) 

AMATEUR  DADDY— Fox.— If  you  can  imagine 
Warner  Baxter  mothering  a  brood  of  orphaned  chil- 
dren you'll  enjoy  this.    Great  for  the  kids.    (May)

author  Sinclair  Lewis  nor  you  will  find  fault

(Jan.)

all  means.    (March)

German  flier.  Ernst  Udet,  who  appeared  in  "White

fine.      (June) 

BEN  HUR— M-G-M.— Although  filmed  in  1025 
and  dressed  up  in  new  sound  effects,  this  Ramon 
No varro- Francis  X.  Bushman  picture  is  still  eye- 
filling  and  exciting.     (Feb.)

yarn.  Eddie  Quillan  puts  over  startling  business 
deals  and  wins  Maureen  O'Sullivan.    (Feb.)

yarn  with  lots  of  laughs.  Ben  Lyon  plays  a  "ham"

tion Syndicate. — An  exciting  travelogue  in  aboriginal

hokum  exceptionally  well.    (May)

only  woman  monocle  wearer.     (May) 

CAIN — Talking  Picture  Epics. — Although  not  as 
idyllic  as  "Tabu."  this  modern  Robinson  Crusoe  story-

charming  comedy  with  good  situations  and  John 
Boles.     (M 

CARNIVAL  BOAT— RKO-Pathe.  — Runaway

camp  melodrama  above  the  mediocre.     (May) 

CHARLIE  CHAN'S  CHANCE— Fox— Warner

•      DANCE     TEAM— Fox.— Sally      Eilers  and

mustn't  miss  those  two  kids!    (March)

$1  does  the  work  of  *3 
in  over  50  antiseptic  uses 

PEPSODENT  ANTISEPTIC  goes  3  times  as  far,  because  it 
can  be  diluted  with  2  parts  of  water.  That's  economy  for  you! 


OUT  of  every  $3  you  spend  for  ordi- 
nary antiseptics  you  might  as  well 
save  $2.  It's  a  simple  problem  of  arith- 
metic. Pepsodent  Antiseptic  is  three  times 
as  powerful  as  other  leading  mouth  anti- 
septics—  by  adding  water  it  goes  three 
times  as  far — givesyou  three  times  asmuch 
for  your  money — and  gives  you  extra  pro- 
tection against  sore  throat  colds  and  un- 
pleasant breath,  against  the  many  types  of 
germ  infection  that  daily  threaten  health. 

Here's  the  great  difference  between  old- 
fashioned  mouth  washes  and  Pepsodent 
Antiseptic.  Most  old-fashioned  mouth 
antiseptics  must  be  used  full  strength  to 
be  effective — but  three  people  out  of  four 
add  water  before 
using.  So  the 
new  discovery, 
Pepsodent 
Antiseptic,  was 
made  powerful 
enough   to  be 
diluted  and  still 
be  effective.  Yet 
it  is  completely 
safe  when  used  full  strength. 

It's  costly  enough  to  use  an  antiseptic 
that  should  be  used  full  strength.  But  it's 
a  lot  more  costly  to  dilute  that  antiseptic 
and  fail  to  kill  the  germs.  That's  why 
we  warn  you  to  choose  an  antiseptic 
that  kills  germs  when  diluted.  Insist  on 
Pepsodent  Antiseptic — developed  by  the 
laboratories  famous  throughout  the  world 
as  authorities  in  matters  of  oral  hygiene. 
Be  safe.  Safeguard  the  health  of  your 
family — and  save  your  money. 

Amos  'n'  Andy  are  brought  to 
you  by  Pepsodent  every  night

Pepsodent  Antiseptic 


A  modern 
antiseptic  for 

COLDS 

and  49  other 
uses 


BAD  BREATH  (Halitosis) 

The  amazing  results  of  Pepsodent  Antiseptic  in  fighting  sore  throat  colds,  prove  its 
effectiveness  in  checking  Bad  Breath  (Halitosis).  Remember,  Pepsodent  is  3  times 
more  powerful  in  killing  germs  than  other  leading  mouth  antiseptics.  Remember, 
it  kills  germs  even  when  diluted  with  water! 

Some  of  the  50  different  uses  for  this  modern  antiseptic

Throat  Irritations  Canker  Sores

overcrowded  Orphanages  and  Children's

HUNGER  AND  MISERY— Among  other

Few  realize  the  extent  and  intensity  of 
hunger  and  suffering  in  many  remote 
communities  and  isolated  places  which 
are  not  and  cannot  be  included  in  our 
usual  Community  Chests. 

These  have  a  legitimate  call  upon  Amer- 
ican Philanthropy.  But  only  the  intuitive 
insight  of  a  mother's  love  can  fully  sense 
the  acuteness  of  their  needs. 

Even  though  Mothers  Day  is  past,  what 
better  way  to  honor  Mother  now  than  to 
care  for  some  of  these — our  unseen  neigh' 
bors.

TEX  TAKES  A  HOLIDAY— Argosy  Prod.— This

(March) 

THEFT  OF  THE  MONA  LISA,  THE— Tobis  — 
Love  story  of  an  Italian  lad.  German  drama  with 
few  English  titles,  making  the  picture  lack  interest 
for  those  who  do  not  understand  German.      (June) 

THIRTY  DAYS — Patrician.— A  wealthy  tene- 
ment owner  plays  the  regeneration  scene  in  jail. 
Betty  Compson  and  Maureen  O'Sullivan  make  it  en- 
tertaining.    (Jan.) 

•  THIS  IS  THE  NIGHT— Paramount.— This  is 
a  light  and  farcical  interlude  that  moviegoers 
long  for.  Lily  Damita  is  charming  as  is  Thelma 
Todd.  Roland  Young  and  Charles  Ruggles  are  mar- 
velous comedians. 


THIS  RECKLESS  AGE— Paramount. — In  spite 
of  a  grand  cast  (including  Richard  Bennett)  this  yarn 
came  too  late.     The  jazz  age  is  pretty  cold.    (March)

Pitts  and  Skeets  Gallagher.     (June) 

TWO  KINDS  OF  WOMEN— Paramount.—

•  TWO  SECONDS— First  National.— If  you 
don't  like  your  drama  full  measure,  don't  see 
this.  The  story  of  what  passes  through  a  man's  mind 
in  the  last  two  seconds  ho  is  conscious  before  elei  I  lo- 
cution. Edward  Robinson's  work  is  memorable  and 
the  beauty  of  Vivienne  Osborne  impressive.     (June) 

TWO  SOULS  (Zwei  Menschen)— Cicero  Prod.— 
Heavy  drama  and  bright  spots  in  the  Tyrolese

Western 


WOMAN  COMMANDS,  A— RKO-Pathe.— Pola 
Negri  in  her  comeback  film  is  beautiful  and  alluring, 
but  the  story  is  trite  and  impossible.  See  Pola, 
anyhow.     (Feb.) 

WOMAN  OF  MONTE  CARLO,  THE— First 
National. — Lil  Dagover  bows  to  American  audiences 
in  a  weary,  over-talkative  drama.  Lil  could  do  better 
with   better   material.      (Feb.) 

WORKING  GIRLS — Paramount.— Two  beauti- 
ful country  blondes  learn  about  life  in  the  city.  But

the  revolution.  The  heroine  fights  for  her  honor.  Old 
stuff  made  worthwhile  by  Elissa  Landi  and  Lionel 
Barrymore.     (Jan.) 

•  YOUNG  AMERICA— Fox.— This  is  about 
those  youngsters  who  get  the  reputation  for 
being  the  "worst  kids  in  town."  Raymond  Borzage 
steals  the  show.  Doris  Kenyon  has  never  been  love- 
lier, and  Spencer  Tracy  and  Ralph  Bellamy  do  grand 
work.     (June) 

YOUNG  BRIDE— RKO-Pathe.— Eric  Linden  and 
Helen  Twelvetrees  are  better  than  the  story.    (May)

•THIS  IS  THE  NIGHT" 

Want  to  know  what  my  friends  thought  of 
"This  Is  the  Night "?  Well,  a  bunch  of  us  went 
to  the  show  together — three  couples.  One  of 
the  hoys  said:  ''That  was  a  swell  picture,  and 
even  if  a  couple  of  those  risque  scenes  did 
embarrass  you  girls,  you're  old  enough  to  bear 
up  under  it.  Guess  your  moral  characters  are 
formed,  or  whatever  it  is  that  worries  the 
censors."  Another  boy  said:  "Gosh,  what  a 
relief  to  see  some  good-looking  dames  again  on 
the  screen,  without  having  to  wade  through  a 
lot  of  weepy  scenes.  I'm  fed  up  on  the  tense, 
dramatic  stuff. " 

As  for  us  girls,  especially  myself,  it's  the 
first  picture  I  have  seen  in  weeks  that  didn't 
leave  me  with  red  eyes  and  my  hanky  rolled 
up  in  a  wet  ball.  Honestly,  the  deluge  has 
been  awful — what  with  "The  Strange  Case  of 
Clara  Deane, ''  "So  Big,''  "Xight  Court''  and 
all  the  other  good  tear-jerkers.  This  time  it 
didn't  take  us  more  than  a  minute  to  repair 
our  make-up  before  tackling  a  round  of  marsh 
mallow  nut  sundaes. 

And  that  Roland  Young — well,  all  I  can  say 
is,  he  made  me  forget  Clark  Gable  completely. 
Isabel  Eldridge,  St.  Louis,  Mo. 

"FLESH  IS  WEAK"— ALSO  STORY 

Robert  Montgomery  has  always  seemed  a 
clever,  capable  actor  but  the  slip  he  made  in 
accepting  such  a  story  as  "But  the  Flesh  Is 
Weak"  is  unforgivable. 

He  dashed  around  too  fast,  got  nowhere, 
won  his  race  with  nobody  going  nowhere  and 
became  the  dashing  bridegroom  of  a  woman 
deserving  clothes,  cars  and  jewels,  without  a 
jit  in  his  jeans!  Boy,  oh  boy,  what  an  ending 
— what  a  beginning — what  a  picture!  Terrible! 

Harriet  Salisbtry,  Independence,  Mo. 

CHARACTERIZATION  CLOTHES 

It  is  a  mystery  to  me  why  some  people  are 
always  shocked  at  the  clothes  the  actresses 
wear.  Many  people  thought  the  gowns  Norma 
Shearer  wore  in  "A  Free  Soul "  were  immodest. 
Naturally,  Norma  couldn't  play  the  role  of  a 
daring  and  unconventional  person  sincerely  in 
the  dress  of  a  Puritan  Priscilla.  Clothes  play 
an  important  part  in  creating  an  impression  of 


the  character  being  portrayed.  I  think  that 
the  actresses  should  dress  according  to  the 
type  of  rule  they  assume.

\    sock  AT  THE  CENSORS 

We  natives  of  the  Buckeye  state  pay  the 
same  price  to  see  a  motion  picture  that  those 
in  other  states  do,  but  owing  to  censorship  in 
Ohio  our  pictures  are  so  cut  and  slashed  and 
so  many  scenes  are  eliminated  that  I  feel  as  if 
I'm  paying  first-classprices  for  second-hand  mer- 
chandise. Censorship  is  politics — nothingmore. 
Elsie  C.  Buchsief,  Columbus,  Ohio. 

WIFE  OK  STAR? 

Why  isn't  Ann  Harding  more  like  Barbara 
Stanwyck — a  real  wife?  When  it  came  to  a 
decision  and  it  meant  husband  or  profession, 
for  the  sake  of  her  baby  and  her  self-respect, 
she  should  have  chosen  the  man  she  married 
and  loved  and  forgotten  all  else.  This  episode 
in  her  life  will  not  endear  her  to  her  public. 
Mrs.  E.  A.  Gliddex,  Melrose,  Mass. 

RICARDO-S  SYMPHONY 

For  a  long  timel  have  wished  that  I  might 
see  Ricardo  Cortez  in  a  star  part.  I  saw  him 
in  "Symphony  of  Six  Million"  and  he  was 
fine.  I  have  wondered  why  the  studios  did 
not  give  Cortez  roles  in  which  he  could  show 
his  great  acting  ability.  I'm  glad  they  have 
done  so  at  last.  We  want  to  see  more  of  Ricardo 
and  his  fine  profile. 

Mrs.  G.  H.  Percy,  Walpole,  Mass. 

"THE  MIRACLE  MAN" 

College  seniors  aren't  supposed  to  be  inter- 
ested in  religion  and  God  but  "The  Miracle 
Man"  got  me.  I've  heard  lots  of  discussion 
around  the  campus  and  I  think  all  young 
people  should  be  forced  to  see  that  picture. 
If  they've  anything  at  all  above  the  eyebrows 
it  will  make  them  use  it.  "The  Miracle  Man" 
is  a  challenge. 

Lawrence  Jamisox,  Lima,  Ohio. 

"The  Miracle  Man"  did  me  more  good  than 
any  sermon  and  I  am  sure  that  it  had  that 
effect  on  millions  of  others  who  saw  it. 

Katherixe  Christ,  Henderson, Ky: 


My  sole  purpose  in  going  to  a  picture  is  to 
forget  the  daily  grind  and  relax,  but  I  get 
fooled  sometimes  and  I  find  myself  coming 
out  of  the  theater  feeling  as  if  I  had  been  to  a 
funeral. 

D.  W.  TAYLOR,  Spartanburg,  S.  C. 

CRYING  FOR  GILBERT 

Why  can't  John  Gilbert  have  a  real  chance? 
It  seems  that  the  public  must  accept  the  actors 
the  producers  want  them  to  see  and  the  others 
must  go  down  the  street  of  forgotten  men. 
Why,  for  instance,  didn't  Gilbert  have  the 
name  role  in  "Arsene  Lupin"?  The  part 
cried  Gilbert  loudly  enough  for  many  fans  to 
hear,  but  apparently  the  producers  could  not. 
L.  Hortox,  St.  Louis,  Mo. 

JOHNNY  CAN  DRESS  LP 

Somebody  said  that  Johnny  Wcissmuller 
cannot  succeed  as  an  actor  in  regular  produc- 
tions because  he  does  not  look  well  fully  clothed, 
is  too  tall,  etc.,  etc.  All  of  which  is  the  bunk! 
I  prefer  to  watch  Johnny  Weissmuller  on  the 
screen  rather  than  Gary  Cooper,  Neil  Hamil- 
ton, Doug  Fairbanks,  Jr.,  Jimmy  Durante, 
Charles  Ruggles,  Clark  Gable  and  many  others. 
E.  M.  W'ightmax,  Asbury  Park,  N.  J. 

MORE  GOOD  THAN  BAD 

I  here  give  the  opinion  of  a  woman  who  is  a 
great  church  worker,  an  earnest  student  of  the 
Bible  and  a  wonderful  wife  and  mother  with 
several  grown  children.  She  said,  "  I  am  in 
favor  of  the  Saturday  midnight  showings  of 
the  talkies.  When  my  boys  and  girls  are 
attending  these  I  know  where  they  are  and 
what  they  are  doing.  As  for  the  sort  of  pictures 
they  see — one  has  to  take  the  bad  with  the 
good  in  all  things  and  I  believe  that  there  are 
more  good  pictures  than  bad." 

Mrs.  J.  K.  Exglaxd,  Harlingen,  Texas. 

WELCOME  BACK,  MARY 

Hurrah  for  Mary  Brian,  back  after  her  too 
long  absence  from  the  screen.  She  and  Doug, 
Jr.,  were  both  splendid  in  "It's  Tough  to  Be 
Famous."  And  that's  what  I  consider  a 
dandy  picture— lively,  up  to  date  and  well 
directed. 

Mrs.  J.  A.  Caldwell,  Dallas,  Texas. 


Just  look  at  the  crowds  that  tried  to  get  in  to  see  "Grand  Hotel"  on  Broadway,  the  most  blase  street  in  the  world. 
And  it  seems  that  every  other  person  in  this  photograph  wrote  us  a  letter  to  praise  or  criticize  Garbo,  Joan  or  Beery 


n 


Here's  your  chance  to  air  them 


"Every  young  person  should  be  forced  to  see  'The  Miracle  Man,'  "  wrote  a  college  lad.     And  hundreds  seconded 
his  motion.  Chester  Morris,  Sylvia  Sidney,  John  Wray  and  Ned  Sparks  were  liked,  but  the  picture  itself  was  the  star 


A  BOOST  FOR  BOB 

I  want  to  express  my  thanks  to  Robert 
Young  for  his  wonderful  performance  in  "The 
Wet  Parade. "  I  think  he  will  reach  heights 
that  have  been  vacated  by  some  of  our  formerly 
great  stars. 

Virginia  Feexey,  Washington,  D.  C. 

'RAY,  'RAY,  KAREN 

Why  not  give  Karen  Morley  a  starring  part? 
She  proved  her  acting,  dressing  and  looking 
ability  in  "Arsene  Lupin,"  one  of  the  best 
pictures  of  the  year.  This  is  the  general 
opinion  of  the  fellows  here,  so  she  must  be 
good,  for  college  students  are  generally  pretty 
hard  to  satisfy. 

B.  W.  Toille,  Princeton,  N.  J. 

RECAPTURED  ROMANCE 

A  year  ago  when  my  husband  died  all  the 
romance  and  glamour  seemed  to  go  out  of  my 
life.  Then  a  friend  gave  me  a  copy  of  Photo- 
play and  suggested  that  I  seek  comfort  in 
motion  pictures.  I  have  recaptured  the 
romance  that  I  thought  would  never  be  mine 
again.  I  owe  more  to  the  movies  than  I  can 
ever  express. 

Barbara  Wixfleld,  Oakland,  Calif. 

MORE  ABOUT  "TARZAN" 

The  best  picture  of  the  year  so  far  is  "Tar- 
zan,"  because  it  is  clean,  it  is  educational,  it  is 
entertaining.  We  liked  the  acting  of  Johnny 
Weissmuller  and  thought  he  was  perfectly 
cast.  The  picture  appeals  to  all  types.  It  is 
marvelous  for  children,  there  is  romance  for 
the  young  folks  and  the  gorgeous  scenery  and 
man-to-beast  encounters  thrill  the  more  serious 
minded. 

Joa.v  Herbert,  Denver,  Colo. 

OPINIONS  FROM  FAR  AWAY 

I  like  such  films  as  "  Common  Clay. " 
Connie  Bennett's  acting  was  enjoyable,  but  I 
observe  that  she  speaks  so  rapidly  it  is  difficult 
to  follow  her.  I  should  say  that  she  was 
simply  reciting  her  role.  If  she  would  try  to 
be  plain  and  steady,  she  would  gain  more 
admiration. 

A.  Soliman,  Giza,  Egypt. 


Several  years  ago  I  lived  in  an  isolated  native 
village  in  Alaska  where  there  was  no  contact 
with  the  outside  world  until  an  enterprising 
merchant  installed  a  motion  picture  machine. 
Some  of  the  films  were  ancient  and  in  very  bad 
condition.  But  the  people  would  wait  patiently 
until  a  broken  film  was  mended.  To  most  of 
the  inhabitants  trains,  automobiles,  street  cars 
and  airships  were  myths.  Motion  pictures 
made  them  actualities. 

Mrs.  A.  C.  Erskixe,  Ketchikan,  Alaska. 

Motion  pictures  should  be  made  to  point 
the  way  to  a  better  life.  Sex  is  given  too  much 
importance  in  pictures.  The  producers  should 
think  less  of  making  money  and  more  of  mak- 
ing beautiful  pictures. 

Liem  Toent  Lok,  S'baia,  Java. 

Garbo  is  a  machine  made  actress,  turned 
out  by  Hollywood.  Dietrich  acts  under  the 
influence  of  Von  Sternberg,  but  the  perfect 
understanding  between  star  and  director  makes 
Dietrich  the'  most  interesting  and  beautiful 
actress  of  the  age. 

Leila  Roxald,  Middlesex,  England. 

'The  Son  of  India"  was  a  grand  picture, 
but  there  were  many  mistakes.  One  would 
hardly  expect  a  one  hundred  per  cent  American 
to  have  a  Russian  name — then  why  allow  a 
prince,  who  was  obviously  a  Hindoo,  to  bear 
a  Mohammedan  name?  Hindoos  and  Moham- 
medans are  as  far  apart  as  the  poles  in  every- 
thing. Another  thing  that  did  not  go  well  with 
the  crowd  here  was  to  see  a  Hindoo  kiss  a 
woman.  Such  a  thing  is  absolutely  not  done, 
be  the  woman  his  wife,  mother  or  sister. 

Eustace  Clarexce  Barr,  Bombay,  India. 

America  goes  to  talkies  mostly  for  entertain- 
ment. In  Europe  we  look  upon  them  not  only 
as  an  amusement,  but  as  an  important  branch 
of  art. 

E.  Gould,  London,  England.

Jim  Roberts,  Victoria,  Australia. 


We  want  to  see  Maurice  Chevalier  in  gay 
little  romances  like  '.'  Innocents  of  Paris. "  I 
have  always  liked  him,  but  if  I  have  to  watch 
many  more  of  his  screen  philanderings  as  in 
"The  Smiling  Lieutenant,"  I  shall  give  up 
the  ghost. 

Lillian  Dusky,  Gisboom,  New  Zealand. 

The  alluring  beauty  and  the  fascinating 
personality  of  Joan  Crawford  have  placed  her 
at  the  head  of  the  star  list.  I  consider  her  the 
best  screen  actress  and  the  most  wonderful 
woman  in  Hollywood.

Six  months  ago  we  left  America  to  make  our 
home  in  Stockholm,  Sweden.  We  had  been  in 
the  habit  of  taking  our  young  daughters  to  a 
movie  about  once  a  week,  but  here  we  dis- 
covered the  existence  of  a  new  form  of  censor- 
ship. About  nineteen  out  of  every  twenty 
pictures  are  marked,  "Children  forbidden." 
Now  we  are  doubly  thankful  for  every  clean 
picture,  which  the  whole  family  may  enjoy 
together. 

Our  monthly  copy  of   Photoplay   is  wel- 
comed with  great  rejoicing  and  read  from  cover 
to  cover.   It's  "news  from  home"  to  us  now. 
Mrs.  Rolf  Hurup,  Stockholm,  Sweden. 

According  to  an  American  lady  reformer  I 
heard  lately,  "The  movies  appeal  only  to 
children  and  illiterates  and  leave  a  bad  effect 
upon  young  people.  "  Why  do  these  American 
reformers  have  to  come  here  to  poison  our 
minds  against  American  movies?  Do  they  not 
realize  what  a  wonderful  appeal  the  motion 
picture  has? 

Carlos  Bernabe,  Philippine  Islands. 

Why  give  so  many  young  girls  with  nothing 
but  sweet  faces  so  much  prominence  upon  the 
screen? 

Arxe  Dexckert,  Stockholm,  Sweden. 

RANDOM  OPINIONS 

Why  in  the  name  of  good  movies  don't  they 
give  Richard  Arlen  a  break?  He  is  one  hundred 
per  cent  perfect. 

Margaret  Coxrad,  Philadelphia,  Penna. 

Here's  a  bouquet  for  Photoplay  for  having 
such  an  intelligent  answer  man.

YOU    WANT    THEM    TO 


GROW 


Sturdy 

Here's  the  dish  to  help  them — 
' 'better  bran  flakes" 


DON'T  you  often  hear  the  chil- 
dren talking  about  the  cham- 
pion golfer,  the  tennis  stars  of 
the  year,  about  the  outstanding 
figures  of  today's  sports?  They 
know  all  about  them,  imitate 
them,  hope  some  day  to  grow 
as  strong  and  sturdy. 


This  desire  comes  from  the 
eagerness  of  their  muscles.  They 
need  nourishment .  .  .  lots  of  it. 
They  need  the  healthful  food 
that  helps  keep  you  fit  and  well. 

There's  a  delicious  ready-to- 
eat  cereal  that  meets  this  need 
. .  .  Kellogg's  PEP  Bran  Flakes. 
They're  filled  with  whole 
wheat  goodness. 

Whole  wheat  is  one  of  the 
most  nourishing  foods.  Nature 
has  made  it  a  storehouse  of  rich 
value,  of  iron  and  other  min- 
erals,   vitamins    and    proteins. 


Kellogg  has  made  these  better 
bran  flakes  extra  delicious  by 
adding  the  wonderful  flavor  of 
Pep — and  extra  healthful  be- 
cause of  the  bran — just  enough 
gentle  bulk  to  be  mildly  laxative. 

Give  your  children  these  deli- 
cious flakes  often.  For  break- 
fast, for  lunch,  for  an  after- 
school  snack.  For  the  bedtime 
meal.  And  enjoy  them  yourself. 

Made  by  Kellogg  in  Battle 
Creek.  Always  oven-fresh  in  the 
red-and-green  package  at  your 
grocer's.  Quality  guaranteed. 


FOR  CHILDREN:  Tune  in  Kellogg's  SISGJSG  LADY  every  afternoon,  except  Saturdays  and  Sundays,  over  stations  affiliated 
with  the  N.  B.  C.  from  Coast  to  Coast.  5.30  Eastern  Daylight  Time,  6.00  o'clock  Central  Daylight  Time,  5.30  Pacific  Coast 
Time.  Songs  and  stories  children  love. 


A  uuffet  Supper  idea   /^^ 


Adrienne  Ames  gives  Sun- 
day suppers  buffet  style 


Good  substantial  food  is  Adrienne's  recipe  for 
successful  Sunday  buffet  suppers.  Note  her 
smart  tucked  sheer  silk  frock — perfect,  isn't  it? 


ADRIENNE  AMES  is  one  of  my  favorite    Sunday 
night  supper  hostesses.    You  can  go  to  her  house  with 
hardly  more  than  a  late  breakfast   foundation  and 
know  that  your  ravenous  appetite  will  be  done  right  by ! 
Adrienne's  parties  are  planned  with  a  very  good  thought  in 
mind,  and  that  is,  that  guests  are  more  likely  to  carry  away  a 
lingering  memory  of  simple  but  good  food,  rather  than  fancy, 
indigestible  things. 

The  buffet  type  of  Sunday  supper  is  quite  the  rage  in  Holly- 
wood now.  A  large  or  small  number  of  guests  can  be  enter- 
tained so  easily  this  way — and  buffet  affairs  have  that  charming, 
informal  atmosphere  everyone  likes.  Chafing  dishes  or  hot  plates 
will  keep  things  warm  while  the  guests  file  past  to  take  their 
choice.  A  typical  menu  for  one  of  her  suppers  is  as  follows: 

Oysters  and  Mushrooms  Scrambled  Eggs  with  Corn 

Cheese  Rolls 

Red  and  White  Cabbage  Salad      Tomato  and  Artichoke  Salad 

Stuffed  Dill  Pickles 

Coffee  Tea 

Petits  Fours 


Oysters  and  Mushrooms — Here's  a  delicious  dish 
stem  two  pounds  of  mushrooms, 
cut  into  pieces  and  stew  slowly 
in  two  tablespoonsful  of  butter 
for  an  hour.  Ten  minutes  before 
they  are  done,  add  two  more 
tablespoonsful  of  butter.  When 
this  butter  is  melted,  add  one 
tablespoonful  of  flour,  blend  well. 
Let  the  whole  mixture  simmer  a 
little  longer  before  adding  three 
quarters  of  a  cup  of  cream.  Then 
add  one  cup  of  cooked  finely  cut 
celery  and  oysters.  The  oysters 
should  be  cut  in  half,  lengthwise. 
Before  pouring  your  mushrooms 
and  oysters  in  a  chafing  dish, 
add  a  teaspoon  of  bitters. 

Adrienne's  scrambled  egg  and 
corn  dish  can  be  made  in  a  jiffy.

She  scrambles  together  one  dozen  eggs,  one  cup  of  whole  kernel 
corn,  half  cup  of  cream,  salt,  pepper  and  paprika.  This,  too,  is 
served  from  a  chafing  dish.  Strips  of  bacon  curls  can  be  used 
as  garnishment. 

If  you  have  never  had  cheese  rolls  the  way  Adrienne  makes 
them,  you  have  a  treat  in  store  for  you.  She  orders  hard  club 
rolls  from  the  bakery.  These  are  cut  in  half,  crosswise.  Then 
the  soft  part  is  removed  and  packed  tightly  with  a  cheese  mix- 
ture consisting  of  a  half  pound  of  cream  cheese,  two  table- 
spoonsful of  mayonnaise,  one  tablespoonful  of  cream  and  one 
half  cup  of  cooked,  finely  chopped  chipped  beef.  The  rolls  are 
then  set  away  until  the  cheese  mixture  is  firm.  Adrienne  then 
slices  these  in  half-inch  slices  and  serves.   Don't  fail  to  try  this! 

Red  and  White  Cabbage  Salad — This  salad  is  as  colorful  look- 
ing as  it  is  good.  Two  cups  of  shredded  white  cabbage  and  two 
cups  of  shredded  red  cabbage  are  mixed  with  one  cup  of  thin 
mayonnaise.  To  this  is  added  two  dozen  and  a  half  Spanish 
spiced  olives.    Chill  and  serve  in  a  bowl  bedded  with  lettuce. 

Tomato  and  Artichoke  Salad — Four  large  tomatoes,  sliced  and 
cut  into  fours  are  combined  with  a  medium  sized  jar  of  arti- 
choke hearts  cut  into  small  pieces.  To  this  is  added  one  table- 
spoonful of  tiny  pickled  onions 
and  the  whole  mixed  with  French 
dressing  to  which  a  tablespoon- 
ful of  caviar  has  been  added. 
Chill  and  serve  in  a  deep  bowl 
of  lettuce. 

Have  you  ever  eaten  stujfed 
dill  pickles?  Ends  are  cut  off  the 
large  dills  and  the  centers  are 
scraped  out.  Then  this  tasty  mix- 
ture is  stuffed  into  them:  one 
small  can  of  deviled  tongue,  one 
tablespoonful  of  celery  chopped 
very  fine  and  a  dessert-spoonful 
of  mayonnaise.  Chill  for  several 
hours  so  that  the  mixture  will 
stiffen. 

Cut  in  thin  slices  and  serve  on 
crackers.

A  week  ago 
I  had  dandruff 
so  badly 


. 


NOW  NOT  A  TRACE 


u 


"After  a  bad  cold,  which  kept  me  in  bed 
nearly  three  weeks,  I  began  to  have  trouble 
with  my  hair  and  scalp.  My  scalp  felt  itchy. 
Every  time  I  combed  my  hair  quite  a  little 
of  it  fell  out.  And  I  developed  a  very  trying 
case  of  dandruff. 

"I  had  never  been  bothered  this  way  be- 
fore and  naturally  was  quite  alarmed.  I  tried 
several  expensive  treatments,  with  very  little 
success,  and  then  my  husband  suggested  that 
I  try  Listerine.  I  was  pretty  skeptical  but  I 
decided  to  do  as  he  suggested.  I  used  it  four 
times. 

"You  can  imagine  my  delight  at  the  end 
of  a  week  to  find  that  there  wasn't  a  trace  of 
dandruff  and  that  my  scalp  no  longer  itched 
and  burned.   I  have  told  other  women  about 


it,  and  they  say  they  too  have  found  it  won- 
derful in  keeping  the  scalp  and  hair  clean 
anil  healthy." 

This  statement  is  typical  of  those  con- 
tained in  letters  from  thousands  of  people 
all  over  the  country. 

If  you  are  troubled  with  loose  dandruff,  give 
Listerine  a  trial.  We  do  not  claim  that  it  is 
infallible  but  in  most  mild  cases  it  gets  quick 
results.  Even  severe  cases  have  yielded  to  it. 

Listerine  attacks  surface  infection,  removes 
and  dissolves  scaly  crusts,  soothes  inflamma- 
tion and  cleans  both  scalp  and  hair.

turn — which  Barbara  did  with  Frank  when  she

at  the  Palace  Theater  in  New  York.  Frank  was 
not  offered  fabulous  sums  for  his  independently 
produced  picture,  for  which  both  had  such  high 
hopes.  But  Babs  doesn't  care.  She  loves  her

and  ours,  too — we'll  let  you  in  on  the  grand  secret 
that  there  are  heavy  negotiations  afoot  between 
Garbo's  manager  and  her  studio  that  will  probably 
mean  Garbo  will  go  to  Sweden  only  for  a  visit,  but

after  her  Reno  decree  she  kissed  her  ex-husband,  Harry  Bannister, 
with  tears  in  her  eyes.    Everybody  believes  they're  still  in  love

Close-Ups  and  Long-Shots 


IF  any  human  being  ever  did 
turn  over  in  his  grave,  such  a 
tiling  must  be  happening  in 
the  old  French  cemetery  where 
lies  the  body  of  Gustave  Flaubert. 
For  out  there  in  Hollywood  one  of 
the  minor  producers  is  taking  his 
great  masterpiece,  "Madame 
Bovary,"  which  is  considered  one 

of  the  greatest  novels  ever  written.  The  copyright 
game  laws  are  off  this  great  work,  but  because  of  the 
nature  of  the  story  no  one  has  ever  thought  of  making 
it  into  a  picture. 

The  Hollywood  producer  has  retitled  it  "Indecent." 
Now  to  be  consistent  all  this  producer  has  to  do  is  to 
take  "Hamlet"  and  retitle  it  "Lust."  Anything  to 
get  the  dough,  I  suppose,  but  it  is  a  flagrant  example 
of  the  highest  crime  in  motion  pictures,  bad  taste. 
Ugh.     Ugh. 

GARY  COOPER,  our  silent  he-man  of  the  great 
open  spaces,  has  returned  to  Hollywood  from  his 
European  travels  with  more  continental  polish  than 
you  would  ever  expect  a  Montana  boy  to  acquire  in 
one  month.  He  is  now  a  perfect  example  of  what  the 
well-dressed  man  should  wear — in  London.  We  hope 
an  accent  does  not  crop  out  on  the  sound  track  of  his 
next  picture. 

Gary  was  taken  right  to  the  hearts  of  the  public 
because  of  his  own  simple  personality,  and  if  there  is 
any  change  in  the  lad  we  are  going  to  recommend  that 
he  take  a  six  months'  leave  of  absence,  throw  away 
those  perfect  fitting  duds,  go  right  back  to  Montana, 
and  rub  that  polish  off. 

IN  spite  of  the  fact  that  there  was  a  plot  afoot  at  her 
studio  to  make  Marie  Dressier  save  herself  from  un- 
necessary strain  and  that  everyone,  from  Louis  B. 
Mayer  to  the  lowliest  prop  boy,  insisted  that  she  take 
plenty  of  rest,  "Grand  Old  Girl"  may  be  Marie's  last 
picture 

Marie  isn't  ill — the  Lord  be  praised!  She  is  just 
tired. 

She  has  never  conserved  her  strength.  During  the 
war,  when  she  was  already  beyond  the  half-century 
mark,    she    delivered     twenty-eight     Liberty     Loan 


speeches  in  fourteen  days.     And 
that's  just  like  her. 

She  has  given  of  her  money, 
her  time  and — most  important  of 
all — her  energy.     She  has  made 
thousands  of  people  laugh  with 
her  and  cry  with  her  and  lovelier. 
"Grand  Old  Girl"  is  going  to 
be  a  different  type  of  character- 
ization from  any  Marie  has  created.     She's  going  to 
remain  a  bad  old  girl  right  to  the  end  of  the  picture 
instead  of  turning  goody-goody. 

BILL  POWELL  has  a  message  of  hope  to  all  aspir- 
ing drama  students.  If  you  aren't  at  the  head  of 
your  class,  don't  worry. 

At  Sargent's  Dramatic  School,  there  was  one  lad 
who  took  all  honors  and  it  was  said  that  when  the  boy 
hit  the  boards  of  Broadway  the  Barrymores  might 
just  as  well  give  up. 

That  was  years  and  years  ago.  The  other  day  an 
unkempt  extra  player  sidled  up  to  Bill  on  the  First 
National  lot  and  struck  Powell  for  a  dollar.  "You 
don't  remember  me,  do  you  Bill?"  he  asked. 

And  then  Bill  looked  and  knew.  It  was  the  bright 
boy  of  the  class. 

"TT  THY,"  writes  a  reader,  "do  you  never  in 
W  Photoplay  tell  us  about  what  the  motion 
picture  industry  is  doing  to  overcome  the  terrific  drop 
in  the  value  of  the  stocks  that  were  sold  to  the  public? 
I  will  venture  the  opinion  that  thousands  of  your  sub- 
scribers like  myself  still  hold  stocks  bought  at  peak 
prices." 

Possibly,  my  friend,  because  I  am  personally  more 
interested  in  pictures  themselves  than  in  the  finances 
of  the  business.  And,  furthermore,  because  the  men 
who  are  attempting  to  bring  the  business  out  of  the 
slough  are  as  much  at  sea  as  you  and  I. 

The  human  equation  is  greater  in  this  business  than 
in  any  other  because  each  unit  of  product  depends 
upon  the  initiative  and  cooperation  of  so  many  in- 
dividuals. Its  raw  materials  and  its  machinery  are 
human  beings.  Writers,  directors,  players,  executives, 
each  a  cog  impossible  to  design  and  tool  with  any 
degree  of  precision.    The  bankers  who  asserted  that  it 


could  be  run  on  ;i  strictly  business  basis  have  found  to 
their  sorrow  that  when  they  attempted  operation  on 
such  a  principle  the  financial  results  were  ghastly. 
The  patient  isn't  dead,  but  it's  pretty  darned  sick. 


well  as  stars,   writers,  and  directors \  lot  of 

brains  have  not  had  a  chance  here  in  Hollywood  be- 
cause of  executives  protecting  their  thrones  and  posi- 
tions.    Deliver  or  else  .   .  ." 


A\  KAR  ago,  when  the  entertainment  stocks  were 
right  in  the  middle  of  a  terrific  slide,  the  boys  at 
the  steering  wheels  of  the  sleds  decided  it  might  be 
seemly  to  do  something  about  putting  on  the  brakes 
and  slowing  down. 

So  they  slashed  salaries  of  stenographers  and  clerks 
in  the  mahogany  panelled  offices  in  New  York  and,  in 
a  few  instances,  marked  the  salaries  of  the  big  shots 
from  $.{,000  a  week  down  to  $"2,9.50.  The  economy 
craze  became  such  a  mania  that  in  several  cases  the 
salaries  of  relatives  were  actually  cut  ten  per  cent. 

HERE,  here,"  they  wired  the  big  shot  producer 
executives  in  the  Coast  studios,  "y°u  must  cut 
the  cost  of  pictures." 

So  the  Coast  big  shots  fired  a  few  gatemen  and  office 
boys  and  wired  back,  "We  are  with  you  heart  and 
soul,"  and  went  back  to  the  backgammon  tourna- 
ments which  had  been  so  rudely  interrupted  by  the 
stupid  New  York  businessmen.  Time  enough  when 
the  important  tournament  was  over  to  find  a  story  for 
the  five  and  ten  thousand  dollar  a  week  stars.  And 
besides,  the  Eastern  executives  were  crass  fellows, 
thinking  only  of  money  and  knowing  nothing  of  art. 

"Creative  artists  like  us,"  said  the  backgammon 
players,  "need  mental  relaxation  after  our  colossal 
mental  efforts.  I  will  double  you,  Max.  Shoot  the 
dice." 


THAT  goes  for  seventy-five  per  cent  of  them.  The 
other  twenty-five  per  cent  are  eccentric  fellows 
absorbed  in  the  making  of  good  pictures  for  the  very 
joy  of  it.  Simpletons  who  never  experienced  the 
ecstasy  of  throwing  two  double  sixes  in  succession,  or 
know  howT  to  play  a  grand  slam  with  thirteen  trumps, 
or  go  around  a  golf  course  under  a  hundred  and 
twenty. 

If  the  proportion  between  these  two  sets  of  men 
could  be  changed  around  it  would  result  in  you  and  I 
going  to  the  movies  two  or  three  times  a  week  like  we 
used  to,  thus  solving  the  major  problems  of  the  boys 
in  the  New  York  offices  and  putting  up  bigger  num- 
bers under  the  stock  exchange  symbols  representing 
the  entertainment  stocks.  We  don't  say  we  are  going 
to  pay  off  in  a  hurry  the  appalling  losses  piled  up  by 
the  former  management's  of  some  of  tin-  companies, 
but  we  will  contribute  a  trifling  hundred  million 
dollars  a  year  or  more,  and  that  ought  to  help  a  little. 


BIT,  as  our  old  pal  Dr.  Munyon  used  to  say.  There 
is    hope.     Listen    to    Sidney    R.    Kent,    the   new 
president  of  the  Fox  Company: 

"This  industry  has  got  to  quit  kidding  itself.     We 
must  strike  a  balance  on  the  worth  of  executives  as 


LESTEN  to  John  Hertz,  new  chairman  of  finances 
of  the  Paramount  Company: 
"You    must   fight  your   way    upstream       That    is 
where  the  coonskins  are.     You  must  fight  clean  with 
recognition   of  the  other  fellow's  rights.     No  hitting 
below  the  belt.     No  kicking." 

A  Chicagoan  who  fought  his  own  way  up  from  the 
streets  to  millions,  he  knew  what  he  was  talking  about 
and  so  did  his  auditors. 

INTO  the  volatile  panorama  rides  a  bright  and  eager 
eyed  young  man  from  the  West,  Merlin  H.  Ayles- 
worth.  He  comes  with  a  brilliant  record  of  accom- 
plishment in  the  world  of  public  entertainment  in  that 
he  is  the  man  who,  as  president  of  the  great  National 
Broadcasting  Company,  guided  radio  from  its  crystal 
set  days  to  its  present  potency. 

A  few  weeks  ago  he  was  drafted  as  president  of  the 
Radio-Keith-Orpheum  Company,  known  on  the 
picture  billboards  as  RKO.  He's  got  a  job  of  recon- 
struction and  reorganization  to  do  that  will  require 
all  the  vision  and  ability  he  showed  in  building  the 
world's  greatest  broadcasting  system,  and  all  he  has  in 
reserve  as  well. 

He  showed  his  mental  and  executive  wares  in  one  of 
his  first  statements.    He  said: 

"The  greatest  asset  the  motion  picture  business 
possesses  does  not  show  on  the  balance  sheet  of  any 
company.  It  is  the  motion  picture  habit  of  the 
American  people.  Compared  to  that  the  physical 
assets  of  theater  properties  and  studios  are  negligible." 

Mr.  Aylesworth,  you  said  a  mouthful.  Good  luck 
to  you. 

THK  box-office  seems  to  be  more  quickly  effective 
than    the   ballot-box,    when    it   comes   to   public 
reaction. 

When  a  majority  shows  its  mind  at  the  box-office 
the  producers  how  and  say,  "Thanks.  We  need  the 
money.     We'll  try  to  give  you  what  you  want." 

When  a  majority  shows  its  mind  at  the  ballot-box 
the  statesmen  say.  "Thanks.  We  needed  the  votes. 
Now  try  and  get  what  you  want." 

MR.  STOCKHOLDING  SUBSCRIBER,  I  may 
have  bored  a  lot  of  my  readers  by  trying  to  give 
a  few  close-ups  and  long-shots  of  the  picture  business, 
but  I've  got  a  lot  off  my  mind  and  I  crave  the  in- 
dulgence of  thousands  who  are  more  interested  in  what 
is  happening  to  Marlene  Dietrich,  Greta  Garbo,  and 
Joan  Crawford.  I  promise  not  to  talk  business  next 
time,  because  I  am  taking  a  train  for  Hollywood  and 
will  give  you  the  real  inside  on  those  three  and  others 
next  month.

1  he  JNuttiest  Quartette 


in  the  World 


By    Sara    Hamilton 


Zeppo 


Harpo 


Groucho 


Chico 


THERE  are  some  people  who 
swear  the  Four  Marx  Broth- 
ers were  pulled  out  of  a  silk 
hat  along  with  two  white 
rabbits  and  a  soiled  dove.  For 
their  grandpappy,  as  a  magician, 
toured  Europe  for  fifty  years  in  a 
covered  wagon  that  carried  his  wife, 
innumerable  children,  together  with  his  scenery  and  a  harp. 

He  could  just  as  easily  have  been  a  sewing  machine  agent  for 
all  the  magic  he  knew.  But  he  got  by.  For  each  night  at  the 
end  of  a  dubious  performance,  grandpappy  very  generously 
offered  to  cut  off  anyone's  head  and  put  it  back  on  again. 

So  you  see  the  Marx  madness  began  with  grandpa  who 
lived  to  be  one  hundred  and  one,  and  thought  nothing  at  the 
age  of  ninety-five  of  snitching  a  cold  potato  from  the  ice  box, 
in  the  middle  of  the  night,  and  eating  it. 

For  several  reasons  no  one  ever  hastened  to  take  up  grand- 
pa's offer  of  a  head  amputation. 

So  his  standing  as  a  worker  of  magic,  stood.  Doubted  of 
course,  but  still  stood. 

Until  one  eventful  night  when  a  huge  German  yokel  decided 
grandpa  knew  his  business  and  volunteered. 

Grandpa  was  flabbergasted.  He  produced  an  ax.  Hoping  the 
victim  would  back  out.  He  never  flinched.  Deciding  the  ax 
was  too  easy,  he  came  on  with  a  saw.  Rusty  around  the  edges. 
The  yokel  thought  he  saw  a  big  improvement.  He  was  for  it 
one  hundred  per  cent.  Grandpa  was  stumped.  Finally  he 
came  on  carrying  a  basin  and  towel.  And  the  yokel  loved  it. 
Actually  grew  impatient  for  the  proceedings  to  begin. 

So  grandpa  stepped  quietly  out  the  back  door  and  somewhere 
else,  his  career  as  a  magician  considerably  damaged  in  places. 

But  one  of  the  little  girls  beneath  the  cover  of  that  wagon, 
felt  the  call,  the  lure  of  the  theater  even  after  she  grew  up, 


The  "Mad  Marx  Brothers," 
who  act  just  as  goofy  off 
the  screen  as  they  do  on 


came   to   America,   and   married 
Sammy  Marx,  the  tailor. 

Hence  the  Four  Marx  Brothers 
on  an  American  stage  and  screen. 
They  have  caught  the  spirit  of 
grandpa's  gay  bluff erino  and  they 
carry  on. 

As  a  matter  of  fact  the  way 
they  carry  on  is  the  stock-in-trade  of  the  four  Marxes. 
Theirs  is  an  indefinable,  gay,  swirling,  sweeping  madness 
that's  beyond  description.  Or  understanding.  Or  explaining. 
There  is  nothing  of  the  practical  joker  about  them.  Or 
crudeness.  Or  maliciousness.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  beneath  it 
all  lies  a  smattering  of  common  sense,  which  makes  it  all  the 
more  confusing. 

LIKE  the  tea  party  in  "Alice"  when  the  March  Hare,  sadly 
dipping  his  broken  watch  up  and  down  in  the  tea,  remarked 
to  the  Mad  Hatter  he  didn't  think  he  should  have  put  the 
butter  in  the  watch  as  the  Hatter  suggested,  as  now  it  wouldn't 
go  at  all.  Whereupon  the  Mad  Hatter  shrugged  and  answered. 
"Well,  it  was  the  best  butter. " 

Which,  of  course,  silenced  the  Hare,  who  nevertheless  felt 
somewhere,  something  was  wrong.     But  what? 

So  it  is  with  the  Marxes. 

For  instance,  here  comes  Heir  Lubitsch  across  the  lot.  The 
inevitable  big  cigar  in  his  mouth.  A  genius.  An  artist  to 
whom  Hollywood  serenely  bows.  Out  of  their  dressing-room 
step  the  Marxes.  Without  a  word,  without  an  instant's 
planning,  or  a  moment's  hesitation,  Harpo  will  seize  Herr 
Ernst  and  into  a  wrestling  bout  they'll  go.  In  broad  daylight. 
For  no  reason.  The  other  three  standing  by.  Seriously  con- 
templating the  twirling  two. 

And   Lubitsch,    completely       [  please  turn  to  page  90  ]

Clara  Bow— Housewife 


This,  ladies  and  gentle- 
men, is  Missus  Rex  Bell, 
generously  serving  her 
good  husband  with  a  he- 
man  helping  of  he-man 
hash.  Clara  Bow  does  all 
the  cooking  at  the  rancho 
— not  only  for  Rex  but  for 
the  ranch  hands  and  the 
guests  as  well.  What's 
more,  she  bakes  her  own 
bread  and  makes  her  own 
cakes.    Honest,  she  does! 


YOU'D  never  have  believed  it  of  Clara  Bow.    And  yet, 
it's  true! 
It's  true  that  Clara,  of  all  people,  has  developed  into 
as  completely  domesticated  a  hausfrau  as  any  bride  ever 
was.    Up  there  on  that  hard-to-get-to  desert  ranch  of  hers  and 
hubby  Rex  Bell's,  she's  the  cook  and  the  chambermaid  and  the 
little  housewife,  one  hundred  per  cent! 

She  cooks  hash  and  prunes  for  hubby,  with  her  own  little 
plump  hands.  She  washes  the  dishes.  She  even  bakes  bread — 
and  cries  when  the  dough  won't  rise!  She  makes  the  beds  and 
sweeps  the  kitchen  floor  and  raises  merry  cain  if  anybody  has 
the  gall  to  come  in  and  disarrange  the  pots  and  tins  from  the 
way  she  wants  them  to  be. 

She's  Missus  Rex  Bell,  and  all  the  wise  know-it-alls  of  Holly- 
wood who  said  that  Rex  Bell  would  merely  become  Mister  Clara 
Bow,  when  she  married  him  less  than  a  year  ago,  can  go  soak 
their  heads  in  a  bucket  of  brine.  Because  Clara  Bow  is  Missus 
Rex  Bell— and  how! 

Yes,  I  know  it  sounds  like  a  dream,  or  like  one  of  those  things 
Ripley  puts  in  his  Believe-It-Or-Nots.     With  years  of  Holly- 


wood experience  behind  me,  and  having  seen  and  observed  and 
known  Clara  Bow  when  she  was  The  Brooklyn  Bonfire,  I 
wouldn't  have  believed  this  myself,  even  if  eighteen  press- 
agents  with  eighteen  bibles  had  come  and  sworn  to  it.  No,  this 
is  no  press-agent  yarn. 

This  is  fact— because  with  my  own  eyes  and  ears  and  other 
wits  (if  any!)  I  learned  it's  true. 

You  see,  with  a  cameraman,  I  popped  in  at  Rancho  Clarito 
(that's  what  the  Rex  Bells  call  that  600.000  acre  stretch  of 
cactus  and  yucca  trees  and  desert  of  theirs)  on  a  day  when 
neither  Clara  nor  Rex  had  any  slightest  expectation  that  some- 
one from  Hollywood  was  coming  to  visit  them — much  less  a 
movie  magazine  writer  with  a  cameraman  to  take  pictures  of 
them. 

There  was  no  chance  for  them  to  frame  up  the  happy 
domestic  scene.  There  was  no  advance  warning  for  them  to 
get  ready  with  those  happy-bride  gags  and  things.  It  was  a 
total  surprise  to  them.  Which,  it  seems,  is  proof  enough  that 
the  amazing  things  about  Clara  Bow  that  are  to  be  told  herein 
are  true,  and  not  simply  bunk. 


Here  is  the  Clara  Bow-Rex  Bell  desert  mansion,  built  in  the  middle  of  the  wilderness  at  a  terrific  cost

Of  Rancho  Clarito 


By  Carl 
Vo  nne  1 1 


Does  that  wink  look  fa- 
miliar? Yessir,  it's  the 
old  Clara  Bow  hot-cha. 
But  Clara  wishes  that  she 
could  leave  the  screen 
forever.  Only  the  need  of 
money  draws  her  back, 
for  she  is  completely 
happy,  absolutely  content 
just  being  the  busy  haus- 
frau.  You  certainly  must 
read  every  word  of  this 
almost    incredible     story 


In  short,  it's  simple  fact  that  Clara,  from  the  sex-appeal  "  It" 
irl  of  her  movie  heyday,  has  by  some  strange  process  of  matri- 
nony  and  love,  developed  into  a  happy  bride  and  housewife, 
mmeasurably  glad  to  be  away  from  the  crowd  and  Hollywood, 
nd  sorry  beyond  words  that  she  has  to  go  back  to  Hollywood 
o  make  one  more  picture. 

Yes,  she  has  to.    It's  not  because  she  wants  to  make  a  movie, 

r  star  on  the  screen,  or  be  famous,  or  go  Hollywood,  that  she's 

ping  to  star  in  "Call  Her  Savage"  for  Fox.    It's  because — and 

lere's  another  surprise! — because  they  need  the  money,  do 

lara  and  Rex. 

If  Clara  had  her  way,  she'd  never  set  foot  in  Hollywood 
igain,  much  less  a  movie  studio.  But  you  can't  build  a  five- 
aedroom  palace  in  the  middle  of  a  Nevada  desert,  with  running 
lot  and  cold  water,  electric  lights,  a  talkie  projection  room  and 
ill  modern  improvements,  without  money. 

It  must    have    taken  Clara  and  Rex  a  couple  of  hundred 
housand  to  build  that  amazing  place  of  theirs,  about  which 
'11  tell  you  more.     And  Rex  certainly  didn't  have  the  couple 
A  hundred  thousand. 


And  you  can  take  it  from  Clara  herself,  all  this  talk  about  her 
having  a  lot  of  money  sunk  in  a  trust  fund  that'll  support  her 
and  pay  her  $500  a  week,  or  something  like  that  for  life,  is  just 
so  much  hooey. 

"It's  just  another  Hollywood  rumor,"  she  says.  "All  this 
(and  her  hands  encompass  that  desert  castle  in  an  embracing 
wave)  costs  money." 

And  so,  for  $75,000,  Clara  Bow  is  going  back  to  Hollywood, 
with  a  definite  reluctance  inside  of  her,  to  make  a  movie. 

And  that's  the  first  time  that  set  of  facts  has  ever  been  told. 

You  remember,  if  you  read  Photoplay  a  year  ago,  the  details 
of  Clara's  life  on  Rex's  ranch,  before  they  were  married.  They 
lived  then  in  a  match-box  of  a  shack,  unpainted  wooden  walls 
with  no  modern  improvements  of  any  kind — not  even  running 
water.     Not  even  a  bathroom. 

And  their  only  bathing  facility  was  a  canvas-walled  lean-to 
against  the  side  of  the  shack,  with  a  pipe  spraying  ice  cold 
spring  water  from  overhead. 

At  that  time,  Clara  and  Rex  stood  in  front  of  that  funny 
shack,  pointed  off  across  a  gully,   [  please  turn  to  page  123  ) 


And  here's  the  shack  they  occupied  a  year  ago  (the  new  one  is  on  the  same  site)  where  Clara  learned  to  live

The  Lion 
Tamer 


By  Ruth  Biery 


WHEN  it  was  decided 
to  film  "Grand  Hotel" 
with  the  most  impor- 
tant cast  ever  assem- 
bled for  a  single  picture,  plans 
were  made  at  once  to  keep  the 
making  of  it  a  secret. 

The  "powers  that  be"  at  Metro 
know  that  Greta  Garbo,  Joan 
Crawford,  John  Barrymore,  Lionel 
Barrymore,  Wallace  Beery,  Lewis 
Stone  and  Jean  Hersholt  could  not 
work  together  without  complica- 
tions. Everybody  else  in  Holly- 
wood knew  it,  too.  It  would  be 
contrary  to  star  nature. 

A  single  lion  may  be  tamed  by 
his  keeper.  But  six  lions  in  one 
cage  for  an  indefinite  period?  That 
would  be  contrary  to  lion  nature. 

A  huge,  cold,  gloomy,  dark  stage. 
No  lights.  No  excited  bustle  of 
production.  A  long  table.  Ten 
chairs.  In  front  of  each  chair  a 
blue  manuscript. 

It  was  one  minute  to  nine  in  the 
morning. 

A  man  entered.  Rapid,  short, 
determined  steps.  Sweater.  Ker- 
chief about  his  neck.  Edmund 
Goulding,  the  Lion  Tamer. 

Metro  officials  believed  it  would 
take  temperament  to  control  tem- 
perament— but  temperament  well- 
molded  with  common  sense  and  a 
gentlemanly  finesse.  They  knew 
this  man  who  had  insisted  upon 


alike  when 
Eddie  made 
"Grand  Hotel" 


directing  a  Swanson  picture — made  Gloria  behave  so  that  he,  rather 
than  she,  should  direct  it.  "The  Trespasser"  had  resulted.  They 
knew  this  fellow  who  had  bullied  Phillips  Holmes  to  success  in 
"The  Devil's  Holiday,"  and  laughed  Nancy  Carroll  into  triumph 
in  the  same  picture.  They  had  chosen  with  shrewd  acumen  when 
they  appointed  this  nervous,  versatile,  hot-tempered,  and  at  the 
same  time  level-headed,  dynamo  as  their  tamer. 

He  drew  out  his  watch  and  turned  to  greet  the  man  who  has 
never  been  late  in  over  forty  years  of  stage  and  screen  experience. 
Lewis  Stone. 

Stone  said,  "Good  morning,"  sat  in  his  chair, 
Director  Eddie         opened  his  script,  lit  a  cigarette  and  waited. 
Goulding.    Lion  "It    doesn't    look   very    much,"    said    Goulding, 

Tamer  Clyde         "but  I  think  it  will  be  effective." 
Beatty.    Their  Stone  smiled  charitably;  closed  the  script:  stamped 

jobs  were  much         his  cigarette;  said:    "  Do  you  need  me?    I  know  im- 
part already. " 

He  had  looked  at  the  script 
for  one  moment. 

Goulding  smiled.  He  recog- 
nized the  sarcasm.  The  part 
was  so  small  that  one  moment 
was  all  that  Stone  had  needed. 
A  flutter  and  bustle.  The 
barking  of  a  dog.  "  Woggles  " 
and  his  mistress  entered  to 
greet  the  man  who  had  not 
directed  her  since  her  first 
days  in  pictures.  And  there 
had  been  plenty  of  fireworks 
in  that  ancient  Crawford- 
Goulding  combination! 

"Hello.  Eddie.  What's  this? 
A  rehearsal?"  asked  Joan. 

"Well,  just  a  reading," 
temporized  the  tamer. 

"  I  know  my  part.  I  read 
the  script  last  night.  " 

Stone  looked  up.  "We're 
all  right  then,  Joan!" 

Joan  ignored  him.  "Do 
you  really  want  me  to  stay? 
It's  silly.  It's  such  a  bit. " 
Irony  in  her  voice;  tears  near 
the  surface. 

The  smile  which  struggled 
on  the  lips  faded  as  Goulding 
answered,  "I  think  you'd  bet- 
ter stay. " 

She  turned  on  her  heel. 
"  All  right.  Call  me  when  the 
others  get  here."  Her  habit 
cf  punctuality  had  cheated 
her  of  a  good  entrance! 
The  polite  silence  between

never  rehearsed  in  my  life  and  never  will.   Let  the  gentle 
men  from  the  stage  do  the  rehearsing.    I  wouldn't  play  a 
man  like  this.    He's  a  dirty  fellow.    The  public  likes  to 
laugh  at  me.    Perhaps  cry  sometimes.    But  in  all  the  years 
I've  been  on  the  screen,  I've  tried  to  keep  the  stuff  clean. 

Here  I  am  pitched  into  playing  some  some  .    I 

hate  the  fellow.    I  tell  you  I  hate  the  fellow!" 

Wally  Beery  had  entered,  flinging  the  foregoing  remarks 
at  the  assistant  director,  Charles  Dorian.  A 
man  who's  afraid  of  nothing.  Stars  do  not  im- 
press him.  He  calls  them  by  the  first  name 
and  he's  always  on  hand  with  proper  epithets 
when  they're  late  or  unruly.  The  Assistant 
Lion  Tamer. 

'Well,  tell  it  to  the  director!" 

Wally  stared  at   Goulding.     "Hello,  Eddie. 
What's' all  this?" 

"Just  a  reading." 

"I  can't  read.    I've  forgot- 
ten my  glasses!"

*  entered.  Pale  face.  Curi- 
ous, pathetic,  blue  eyes.  Hat 
on  the  back  of  his  head;  ciga- 
rette drooping  from  sagging 
lips.  "Thank  Heaven!"  Lio- 
nel Barrymore  removed  the 
cigarette  to  offer  his  greet- 
ings. "Here  is  a  production 
on  which  we  can  get  some 
rehearsals.  Looks  like  the  the- 
ater! It's  great,  Eddie.  How 
did  you  persuade  them  to  let 
you  do  this  thing  properly?" 

Beery  turned  toward  the 
door.  "Well!  You  can  re- 
hearse without  me.  I  can't 
rehearse. " 

Lionel  plunged  into  his  pet 
subject.  "Rehearsal  never 
hurt  anybody.  They  tell  me 
you  aren't  so  good  in  your 
lines!" 

"At  least  I  get  something 
out!" 

The  two  friends  glared  at 
each  other.  Stone  threw  away 
the  stub  of  his  cigarette  and 
leaned  forward.  He  had  al- 
ready begun  to  play  the  part 
of  the  shell-shocked  and  war 
mutilated  doctor  who  just 
watches  and  watches — in 
"Grand  Hotel." 

Ten  thirty!  The  slightly 
Irish  voice  of  the  restrained 
and  almost  judiciallion  tamer 


Just  one  of  the  many  things  to  drive  Director

voices  all  shouting  for  lunch  at  the  same  time

reading  lines.  Only  Jean  Hersholt 
seemed  to  listen.  Joan  was  tatting 
the  center  of  a  large  wall  flower. 
Wally  Beery  was  reading  a  news- 
paper— without  his  glasses.  Stone 
sat  back,  smoking  a  cigarette,  lit 
from  the  stub  of  another,  think- 
ing, perhaps,  of  where  he  should 
plant  primroses  in  his  famous 
ranch  garden. 

A  voice  interrupted.  "Where 
is  the  Swede?" 

Joan  leaned  forward.  Her  eyes 
narrowed.  She  pricked  her  finger. 
A  question  she  had  not  ventured 
to  ask  but  to  which  she  wanted 
an  answer! 

"Away  on  a  vacation!" 

"  A  terrible  thing  about  Edgar 
Wallace.  "  No  one  knew  who  hur- 
ried the  exclamation.  The  as- 
sistant Lion  Tamer  was  suspected. 

A  whistle.  Twelve  o'clock. 
Beery  arose.  "Lunch!"  he  an- 
nounced. 

"Better  finish  this  sequence," 
suggested  Edmund  Goulding. 

"  Lunch, "  thundered  Beery  and 
was  gone. 

Joan  looked  up.  Should  she 
follow?  After  all,  Goulding  had  a 
temper,  Joan  remembered.  She 
didn't  want  to  be  the  first  to  start 
something.  "I'm  hungry,  Eddie. 
After  all,  I  was  here  early — " 

"Let's  finish  the  sequence," 
Lionel  Barrymore  interrupted.

Vilma 


How  the  most  pub- 
licized marriage  in 
Hollywood  has  weath- 
ered  five  amazing 
and    happy    years 


I  SLIPPED  into  a  projection  room  at  the 
Radio  Pictures  studios  the  other  morn- 
ing to  await  the  preview  of  a  picture  and 
accidentally  caught  one  of  the  rushes  of  the 
new  Constance  Bennett  picture, "  What  Price 
Hollywood. " 

In  this  picture  a  producer  was  addressing 
his  '"yes''  men. 

'•  We  are  going  to  have  a  wedding.    It  is  to 
be  the  biggest  wedding  ever  held  in  Holly- 
wood.   I  want  it  to  be  the  most  gorgeous,  the  most  stupen- 
dous— . "  I  did  not  catch  all  the  superlatives  he  was  using.    "I 
want  a  million  dollars  worth  of  publicity  from  it. " 

The  "yes"  men  nodded  in  unison. 

The  producer  referred  to  in  this  "take  off"  on  Hollywood 
was  Sam  Goldwyn;  the  wedding  that  of  Vilma  Banky  and  Rod 
LaRocque. 


It  was  a  good  choice.  There  has  never  been  a  more  "Holly- 
woodish "  wedding.  I  presume  you  have  heard  the  story  of 
the  guest  who  stuck  her  fork  into  one  of  the  turkeys  and  found 
it  was  papier-mache?  There  were  turkeys  to  eat,  of  course. 
But  that  wedding  had  to  have  more  turkeys  than  any  other! 
Props  were  used  for  the  "extras.  " 

Naturally,    everyone    said    the    marriage    wouldn't    last. 


Rod  LaRocque's  bedroom 
is  exactly  as  it  was  when 
he  and  Vilma  were  first 
married,  except  for  a  few 
new  gadgets.  That  funny 
looking  phonograph  at  the 
foot  of  the  bed  i?  Rod's 
alarm  clock.  When  it's  time 
to  get  up  in  the  morning 
the  record  plays  "Moonlight 
and  Roses."  Rod's  the 
world's    champion    sleeper 


& 


The  lovely  living  room  at  the  LaRocque  home  gets  turned 
into  a  photographer's  studio  whenever  Rod  feels  the  urge  to 
shoot.  And  no  matter  what  Vilma  Banky  is  doing  she  poses 
obligingly.  Incidentally,  Rod  is  a  good  portrait  artist.  He 
develops  his  own  negatives  and  makes  his  own  prints.  Note 
his  quite  elaborate  set  of  lights  and  his  excellent  camera

Couldn't!  It  was  simply  a  Hollywood  show. 
The  means  of  securing  one  million  dollars 
worth  of  publicity  for  star  Vilma  Banky  by 
producer  Goldwyn. 

Yet  Vilma  and  Rod  have  celebrated  their 
fifth  anniversary.  The  wedding  has  long 
been  forgotten;  the  marriage  has  lasted.  A 
few  bets  have  been  collected.  Not  many. 
There  were  only  a  few  who  chanced  a  dollar 
on  the  permanence  of  such  an  obviously 
show-window  union. 

After  seeing  these  rushes,  I  drove  down  to 
the  house  on  Lanewood  to  talk  with  Vilma 
and  Rod.  The  same  house  where  Rod  took 
his  show-bride  five  years  ago. 

I  expected  changes  in  that  house.  Joan 
Crawford  and  Doug,  Jr.,  have  been  married 
three  years  and  doing-over  their  home  has 
been  at  least  an  annual  occasion.  Norma 
Shearer  and  Irving  Thalberg  moved  every 
six  months  until  they  built  at  the  beach  after 
the  arrival  of  Irving,  Jr.  Clark  Gable  and 
Mrs.  moved  three  times  that  I  know  of  in 
less  than  two  years. 

I  had  been  to  the  LaRocque  home  shortly 
after  the  marriage.  I  naturally  didn't  expect 
to  recognize  a  piece  of  furniture  in  it. 

But  I  found  that  there  have  been  no 
changes.  [  please  turn*  to  page  118] 


While  other  Hollywood 
folks  change  their  furniture 
as  often  as  their  husbands 
and  wives,  Rod  and  Vilma 
remain  true  to  their  home 
and  to  each  other.  This 
dainty  boudoir  is  the  perfect 
frame  for  Vilma's  blonde 
loveliness.  Off  from  this 
room  is  Vilma's  tiny  study — 
a  miniature   sun   parlor 


L<  a  1     York 


She's  captured  John  Gilbert's  heart  and  all  he 
is  asking  Virginia  Bruce  these  days  is  say 
when.  You'll  see  her  in  "Winner  Take  All" 
and  then  you'll  understand  why  Jack  feels  he 
is  making  no  mistake  in  this,  his  fourth 
venture.  Serene,  blonde,  and — oh — so  beautiful 


WEDDING  hells  for  Virginia  Bruce  and 
Jack  Gilbert.  At  least,  that  is  the  way 
it  looks  as  we  go  to  press 

They  have  made  no  formal  announcement 
hut  they  are  talking  about  possible  dates  for 
August,  when  Jack's  divorce  from  Ina  Claire 
becomes  final. 

Incidentally,  she  is  tentatively  scheduled  for 
Jack's  lead  in  "Down  Stairs,"  the  picture 
which  he  will  make  from  his  own  original  story. 

Although  Jack  and  Virginia  have  been  going 
together  more  and  more  frequently  since  Lups 
Velez  went  to  New  York  and  left  Jack  without 
a  gal  friend,  Hollywood  has  not  taken  the 
romance  any  more  seriously  than  it  takes  most 
of  Jack's  frequent  infatuations.  Then  one  of 
the  little  birds  that  reside  on  the  Gilbert 
estate  tipped  us  that  the  tall,  beautiful,  stately 
blonde  had  for  the  fourth  time  turned  Gilbert's 
thought  to  matrimony. 

Virginia's  entirely  different  from  any  of  the 
wives  whom  Gilbert  has  had  previously.  We 
understand  that  is  her  only  worry.  Can  a  calm, 
cool,  stately  person  keep  temperamental, 
emotional  Jack  happy?    She  is  trying  to  decide 


that  question,  we  understand,  before  she  sets 
the  date. 

"\  7IRGINTA  was  a  chorus  girl  in  Xew  York. 
Paramount  signed  her.  She  didn't  make 
the  grade  and  returned  to  the  stage.  A  year 
and  a  half  later,  Metro  brought  her  back  to 
Hollywood.  Her  most  important  part,  to  date, 
was  the  second  lead  in  the  James  Cagney 
picture,  "Winner  Take  All." 

She  is  a  direct  antithesis  of  the  first  Mrs. 
Gilbert,  the  little  Southern  girl  whom  Jack 
married  and  divorced  before  he  was  an  inter- 
national figure;  from  Leatrice  Joy,  the  volatile 


When  Miriam  Hopkins  gives  a  party, 
she  takes  all  the  guests  upstairs  to  look 
at  this  historical  bed.  Here  is  the 
downy  couch  upon  which  Garbo  slept. 
Miriam  rents   the   Garbo   house   now 


brunette  or  Ina  Claire,  the  animated,  tempera- 
mental pet  of  Broadway. 

Those  who  know  her  best,  say  she  is  the  type 
whose  natural  blonde  hair  never  gets  out  of 
place — nor  her  naturally  serene  temper.  She 
really  looks  more  like  Greta  Garbo  than  any 
woman  who  has  interested  Jack  since  Garbo, 
herself.

Garbo  likes  a  big  bed.  The  mattress 
of  this  is  so  large  that  it  had  to  be  made 
in  several  sections.  The  quilted  spread 
and  all  the  furniture  has  a  sturdy 
look.     Now  it's  Miriam's  guest  room 


^ONSTANCE  BENNETT  has  denied  that 
^^she  is  going  to  retire  from  the  screen,  but  I 
have  inside  information  that  she  intends  to. 

She  is  going  to  England  in  September  for  a 
few  months,  and  when  she  returns  will  devote 
one  more  year  to  pictures.  I  don't  think 
Constance  is  any  too  crazy  about  movie  work. 
She  lived  in  Europe  for  five  years,  you  know, 


and  is  quite  continental-minded.  Both  she  and 
her  husband,  the  Marquis,  could  live  pretty- 
well  for  the  rest  of  their  lives  on  a  million 
dollars,  which  she  will  have. 

The  Marquis  is  a  pretty  regular  fellow-.  I 
like  him.  So  does  every  one,  but  he  has  his 
troubles.  It  isn't  easy  to  be  a  star's  husband  in 
Hollywood.  You  saw  what  happened  to 
Harry  Bannister  and  Ann  Harding. 

"V^OU  can't  get  any  bets  either  way  on  the 

result    of    Jimmy    Cagney's    battle    with 

Warner  Brothers  over  his  weekly  check,  and 

sentiment  is  divided  as  to  whether  Jimmy  is 


Wide  World 

A  real  movie  kiss  you  won't  see  on  any  screen. 
When  Lilyan  Tashman  came  back  to  Holly- 
wood from  her  personal  appearance  tour,  hus- 
band Eddie  Lowe  was  at  the  station  to  give  her 
this  greeting.  In  a  minute  Lil  is  going  to  tell 
him  just  how  many  new  dresses  she  bought 


right  or  not.  The  acting  profession  thinks  that 
he  has  a  fair  chance  of  winning  out  and  getting 
the  weekly  stipend  he  thinks  is  coming  to  him 
because  of  his  ability  to  make  the  box-office 
jingle.  He  is  making  about  one-fourth  of  the 
money  made  by  Ruth  Chatterton  and  William 
Powell,  neither  of  whom  has  anything  like  his 
box-office  drawing  power. 

The  producers,  however,  say  that  a  contract 
is  a  contract.  They  have  already  raised  him 
from  S450  a  week  to  SI, 450. 

Jimmy  seems  to  be  as  stubborn  off  the  screen 
as  on.  He  has  said  that  he  believes  that  his 
character  is  so  definitely  established  on  the 
screen  that  it  will  be  short-lived;  that  he  must 
get  in  his  hay  while  the  sun  shines. 

Hollywood  doesn't  take  his  threat  to  chuck 
the  screen  and  study  medicine  very  seriously. 
It  will  take  him  six  or  seven  years  to  study  and 
serve  his  hospital  apprenticeship  before  he  can 
put  out  a  shingle  as  an  M.  D.  That  would 
bring  him  pretty  close  to  forty  by  the  time  he 
got  down  to  the  real  work  of  serving  pills  and 
mending  broken  bones.

A  pair  of  shoes  for  every 
day  in  the  month — almost. 
But  this  is  June  Clyde's 
studio  shoe  wardrobe. 
She  wears  them  on  the 
screen.  Note  the  tricky 
way  the  shoes  are  hung 
on  the  back  of  the  closet 
door  in  her  dressing-room. 
June's  a    cute    trick,  too 


Come  right  in,  Leslie  How- 
ard. We're  delighted  you 
are  going  to  make  your 
smash  hit  stage  play, 
"The  Animal  Kingdom," 
into  a  film,  with  Ann  Hard- 
ing. You  ought  to  see  the 
fan  mail  that  poured 
into  Photoplay  as  a 
result  of  your  few  pictures 


It's  our  bet  that  Jimmy  is  going  to  be  back 
on  the  screen  before  long  and  that  "Winner 
Take  All''  will  not  be  his  last  picture.  Our 
guess  is  that  the  lawyers  will  get  together  in  a 
put-and-take  game,  and  that  Jimmy  will  come 
out  of  it  with  at  least  SI, 000  more  a  week. 

TTOLLVWOOD  this  month  was  a  seething 
city  of  rebellion.  Almost  every  day  some 
star  walked  into  a  different  producer's  office 
ami  said,  "1  won't.  I  won't."  And  almost 
every  day  a  different  producer  said  to  a  differ- 
ent star,  "If  you  don't  you'll  be  sorry." 

Perhaps  it  was  because  the  town  has  been 
kept  in  a  state  of  excitement  by  the  un- 
certainty of  the  Garbo  contract.  We've  given 
you,  month  by  month,  round  by  round  ac- 
counts of  that  greatest  hold-out  in  motion 
picture  history.  Things  looked  pretty  bright 
when  Garbo's  manager  and  M-G-M  went  into 
long  huddles  and  word  leaked  out  that  Garbo 
would  take  her  vacation  in  Sweden  but  return 
to  make  more  "moom  pitchers. "

A  \D  then  came  the  Hollywood  opening  of 
*-"Grand  Hotel"  and  the  gag  that  set  the 
film  colony  on  its  collective  ear.  Master  of 
ceremonies  Will  Rogers  announced  that  Garbo 
would  appear  after  the  film  was  run  off — 
which  was  startling  enough.  But  when  Wally 
Beery,  who  used  to  do  comic  female  im- 
personations, walked  upon  the  stage,  made-up 
in  a  broad  burlesque  of  Garbo  and  said,  "I 
t'ank  I  go  back  to  Sweden."  the  first  night 
audience  was  knocked  for  a  triple  somersault. 

rT",HE  next  day  the  company  tossed  off  the 
whole  thing  lightly  and  began  to  rave 
about  Joan  Crawford,  which  is  another  signif- 
icant gesture.  For  in  Joan's  new  picture, 
"Letty  Lvnton."  she  is  as  glamorous  as  the 
divine  Swede  ever  dared  be.  Joan's  hats  and 
her  amazing  'and  unbecoming)  mouth  make- 
up are  emphatically  Garboesque.  And  you'll 
hear  the  Hollywood  know-evervthings  telling 
you  that  this  is  M-G-M's  attempt  to  build  la 
Crawford  up  into  a  second  Garbo. 


JIMMY  DURANTE  was  doing  his 
usual  clowning  on  the  set  the  other 
day  when  an  executive  walked  over 
and  said,  "Listen  Jimmy,  don't  you 
think  you  are  getting  too  prominent 
to  be  kidding  around  this  way  all  the 
time?  What  would  you  think  if  you 
saw  Garbo  acting  like  this?" 

Jimmy  thought  a  minute  and  then 
said,  "Boss,  what  would  you  think?" 

f^\F  course,  you  already  know  about  the 
^^.Marlene  Dietrich- Yon  Sternberg  squabble 
which  was  caused  by  the  studio's  refusal  to 
okay  ''The  Blonde  Yenus. "'  a  film  yarn  that 
Marlenc  wrote  for  herself.  Incidentally,  this 
row  brought  out  the  fact  that  there  is  no  clause 
in  Marlene's  contract  which  states  that  only 
Von  Sternberg  can  direct  her.  It's  simply  a 
sort  of  verbal  agreement  and  you'll  hear  folks 
tell  you  that  the  reason  for  the  trouble  was 
that  Paramount  wanted  to  see  what  Marlene 
could  do  without  Von.

Remember  when  Edna  Best  ran  away  from  Hollywood  and  refused  a 
leading  role  because  she  could  not  be  separated  from  her  husband?  Look 
at  Herbert  Marshall  and  then  don't  blame  her.  They  made  a  film  together 
in  England — "Bachelor's  Folly" — and  Herbert  has  signed  to  do  one  for 
Paramount,  when  their  stage  play  closes.   You  can  bet  Edna  will  go  along 


So  the  difficulty  was  solved  when  it  was  de- 
cided that  Clara  should  work  on  the  old  Fox 
lot  on  Western  Avenue,  which  has  been  de- 
serted since  Movietone  City  was  built. 

Nobody  from  other  sets  will  be  dropping  in 
on  her  when  hers  is  the  only  company  at 
work. 

But  if  Clara  could  get  money  doing  anything 
else,  nothing  could  drag  her  back  to  Holly- 
wood. 

On  another  page  of  this  magazine  you'll 
find  the  reason  given  in  one  of  the  most 
graphic  and  amazing  stories  ever  written  about 
Clara,  with  a  bunch  of  facts  that  will  set  you 
on  your  ear. 


TJRICK  up  your  ears,  folks,  here's  great  news. 
That  laughing,  peppy,  bright-eyed  little 
Irish  girl,  Colleen  Moore,  is  back  home — back 
in  Hollywood,  and  chances  are  more  than  even 
that  she'll  be  back  in  pictures  before  Marlene 
Dietrich  can  bat  an  eye. 

Remember  how  discouraged  Colleen  was 
when  her  contract  expired  and  later  when  a 
play  of  hers  flopped?  She's  discouraged  no 
longer.  She  made  a  hit  in  the  West  Coast 
stage  production  of  "A  Church  Mouse"  and 
now  has  signed  a  contract  with  M-G-M. 

She's  a  different  girl — a  chic,  sophisticated 
glamorous  young  woman.

Now  listen,  Hoot  Gibson,  how  could 
you  quarrel  with  a  wife  as  pretty  as 
Sally  Eilers?  When  Sal  was  in  New 
York  she  denied  a  rift,  then  she 
went  back  to  Hollywood  and  the 
blow-up  came.  There's  lots  to  be 
said  on  both  sides  and  friends 
suggest  the  couple  try  arbitration 


Patched  up  as  the  row  now  is,  the  whole 
squabble  was  made  worthwhile  when  a  wise- 
cracker  flipped,  "The  reason  Marlene  can't  do 
the  part  is  because  she  skinned  her  knee  and 
can't  play  the  big  emotional  scene. " 

"DESIDES  the  fact  that  she  just  naturally 
doesn't  like  pictures  any  more,  one  of  the 
real  reasons  that  Clara  Bow  took  so  long  about 
signing  her  contract  to  do  "Call  Her  Savage" 
was  because  she  didn't  want  a  lot  of  people 
watching  her  as  she  worked  and  she  was 
afraid  if  she  should  ask  to  have  her  set 
cleared,  folks  would  say  she  had  gone  ritzy.

How  a  round-cheeked, 
chubby  little  girl  can  look 
so  much  like  the  elderly 
English  gentleman, 
George  Arliss,  is  one  of 
the  wonders  of  Holly- 
wood. Did  we  refer  to 
Mitzi  as  a  little  girl? 
A  thousand  pardons,  Miss 
Green.  She  is  now  a  grown 
young  lady  of  eleven 
—  and  a  trifle  cynical 
about  life,   love  and  art 


Come  On  Back,  Mitzi 


LET  your  Garbos  return  to  Sweden,  let  your  Connie 
Bennetts  retire,  let  your  Janet  Gaynors  go  sophistica'ted 
— Mitzi  Green  is  coming  back  to  pictures.  And,  as 
far  as  I'm  concerned,  that's  the  big  news  of  the  month. 
You  can  take  all  your  glamour  girls  and  lay  them  away  in 
cellophane.  But  let  Mitzi  cavort  for  the  cameras.  And  I'd 
rather  hear  Mitzi  say,  "I  know  a  secret.  I  know  a  secret," 
than  to  watch  Clark  Gable  and  Marlene  Dietrich  do  the  balcony 
scene  from  "Romeo  and  Juliet." 

For  months  and  months  and  months — too  many  months,  if 
you  ask  me — Mitzi  has  been  doing  a  vaudeville  turn,  and 
Hollywood  hasn't  seemed  the  same.  But  a  very  pleasant  little 
bird  whispers  that  La  Green,  the  divine,  is  going  to  act  the 
title  role  in  "Little  Orphan  Annie."  You  know  that  comic 
strip  character.  Won't  our  Mitz  be  great?  It's  right  up  her 
alley! 

You  can  count  on  Mitzi  Green.  She  is  one  star  who  posi- 
tively will  not  do  a  carbon  copy  of  Garbo.  What's  more,  Mile. 
Green  is  just  a  bit  fed  up  on  glamour  and  believes  that  what  the 
cinema  needs  is  good,  human  stories  with  more  heart  interest 
and  less  sophistication. 

Mitzi,  who  is  now  an  old  lady  of  eleven,  would  like  to  run 
for  president  on  a  no-more-glamour  and  a  no-more-arithmetic 
ticket.  "  Keep  glamour  off  the  screen  and  arithmetic  out  of  the 
school  room, "  is  Politician  Green's  slogan. 

At  the  moment  when  I  asked  her  about  the  state  of  her 
affaires  du  coeur,  Fraulein  Green  was  torn  between  strawberry 
parfait  and  chocolate  layer  cake  a  la  mode.  She  admitted  that 
her  heart  was  as  undecided  as  her  stomach,  for  she  cannot 
decide  which  is  the  greater  passion  of  her  life- 
or  Eric  Linden.  The  fact  that  Freddie  is  a 
married  man  and  Eric  as  free  as  bad 
advice  in  Hollywood,  did  not  enter  into 
the  calculations  of  this  heartless  home

wrecker.  I  remember  when  Mitzi  was  a  mere  girl  of  eight  she 
confided  secretly  to  me — and  eighteen  other  people  who  were 
there  at  the  time — that  Buddy  Rogers  was  the  only  man  in 
her  life. 

Now,  looking  back  over  her  youthful  peccadillos  in  a  mature 
fashion,  she  said,  "Buddy  is  a  darling,  but  he's  such  a  boy." 
And  that  disposed  of  the  Rogers  personality  for  all  time,  as  far 
as  Mitzi  is  concerned. 

Mitzi  is  very  definite  about  her  career.  She's  been  doing 
vaudeville  so  she  can  have  her  milk  and  spinach  regularly,  but 
the  pictures  are  her  real  love.  "  I  like  Hollywood  so  much  better 
than  anywhere  else, "  she  said,  looking  very  much  like  her  own 
imitation  of  George  Arliss.  "In  Hollywood  you  can  do  as  you 
please.  For  instance,  in  the  morning  when  I'm  not  working  I 
like  to  put  on  an  old  pair  of  trousers.  You  can  do  that  in 
Hollywood  and  nobody  thinks  anything  of  it.  But  you  can't 
do  that  in  New  York.  "  (Just  after  voicing  this  profound  senti- 
ment, she  decided  upon  the  strawberry  parfait.  But  she 
didn't  eat  it.    Instead  she  got  to  musing  about  her  work.) 


E 


T'S  all  very  different  now, "  she  said.  "I'm  very  sorry  when 
they  cast  me  as  just  a  bratty  little  kid.  In  '  Honey '  it  was  all 
right.  But  remember  that  I  was  just  eight  years  old  then.  But 
when  I  played  in  '  Girl  Crazy '  I  thought  some  of  the  lines  were 
too  broad.  I'm  eleven  now  and  if  I  do  the  same  things  I  did  in 
'  Honey, '  people  will  think  I'm  just  a  very  bad  person  and  rude 
to  my  elders.  And  some  of  the  lines  they  wanted  me  to  say  in 
'Girl  Crazy'  were  ridiculous — lines  that  no  child  would  have 
said. " 

Now  maybe  you  think  I'm  kidding  by  putting  too  elaborate 
words  in  Mitzi's  mouth.    I  assure  you  that  I'm  not.    And  to

YOU  have  seen  that  haunted  face  on 
the  billboards,  on  the  screen  and  in 
magazines  and  newspapers.  The  face 
of  Joan  Crawford.  You  know  those 
too-big,  searching  eyes,  that  full  mouth  which 
seems  to  have  known  suffering,  and  those 
gaunt  cheeks.  Around  the  studios  you'll  hear 
that  the  Crawford  expression  is  a  pose,  an 
attempt  to  imitate  Garbo,  a  rank  affectation. 
And  yet  it  seems  to  me  that  that  haunted 
look  could  come  only  from  some  inherent 
loneliness  or  some  terrible,  futile  yearning  for 
a  goal  beyond  reach. 

Let  us  study  the  woman  behind  that  face 
— Joan  Crawford  herself.  As  this  is  written 
she  is  suffering.  She  is  searching  for  happi- 
ness, but  deep  down  in  her  heart  she  believes 
that  she  will  never  find  it. 

"Happiness  to  me,"  she  explains,  "means 
peace  of  mind,  which  of  course  is  a  mental 
state.  And  I  know  that  unless  I  acquire  it 
pretty  soon  I'll  have  a  severe  and  protracted 
nervous  breakdown.  And  yet,  on  the  other 
hand,  if  I  should  find  a  certain  peace  of  mind. 
it  would  mean  I  had  come  to  a  point  in  my 
life  where  I  no  longer  cared  to  develop.  In 
other  words  I  would  be  standing  still,  simply 
existing — for  to  develop  is  to  live,  to  stand 
still  is  to  exist,  and  to  go  backwards  is  death. 
Obviously,  if  I  arrived  at  a  point  in  my  life 
where   1    was  standing  still,  it  wouldn't  be 

long  until  I  went  backwards in  the 

meantime  some  peculiar  force  keeps  forever 
pulling  me  on  and  on,  until  I  think  I  shall 
die  unless  I  find  rest." 

So  Joan  is  driven  on  toward  tragedy  in  a 
wild  search  for  a  state  of  being, 
which,  if  she  paused  for  breath,  she 
might  find  within  herself!  And  the 
driving  force  of  her  life  is  fear. 
Haunting,  harrowing  fear.  A  fear 
that  develops  from  a  terrible  inferi- 
ority complex.    And  Joan  knows  it. 

"  I  have  one  of  those  things  all 
right,"  she  nods.  "And  I  mean  it 
truly.  I'm  not  saying  it  merely  for 
effect.  Perhaps  I  thought  that  since 
I  was  born  without  the  advantages 
enjoyed  by  other  girls  it  would  be 
necessary  for  me  to  accomplish 
something  outstanding  in  order  to

become  their  equal.  So  I  de- 
termined on  a  dancing  career. 

"After  the  first  thrill  of 
achievement,  however,  I  real- 
ized that  dancing  alone  was 
inadequate,  that  I  must  look 
elsewhere  if  I  would  taste  real 
happiness,  if  I  would  fill  that 
queer,  aching  void  in  my  soul. 
I  then  decided  to  become  an 
actress.  Surely  Unit  would  bring 
me  the  respect  of  the  world! 
But  somehow  it  left  me  dis- 
satisfied. And  since  one  invari- 
ably fears  the  unknown,  I  live 
each  day  in  fear  of  the  future.  " 

Unless  curbed,  the  fierce 
driving  force  of  the  girl,  her 
utter  inability  to  relax,  is  cer- 
tain to  leave  her  with  a  nervous 
breakdown.  Indeed,  she  fully 
expects  one,  although  her  mania 
for  "  development "  has  left  her 
with  no  conception  of  the 
phrase  "over  work. " 

WHILE  making  'Pos- 
sessed,' "  she  relates, 
"  I  wept  each  morning  on  my 
drive  to  the  studio  and  I  wept 
all  the  way  back  home.  And  I 
found  it  impossible  to  sleep  at 
nights  even  though  I  had  a 
horror  of  staying  awake  for- 
ever thinking'  So  I'd  lie  in  bed, 
contemplating  the  future.  I 
fear  it  with  all  my  heart  and 
soul  even  as  I  fear  the  dark. 
"I  no  longer  enjoy  parties, 
as  I  find  the  inaction  and  light 
pleasantries  unbearably  jarring 
on  my  nerves.  And  when  I  do 
attend  them,  wild  thoughts  run 
through  my  head.  On  occasion 
1  feel  that  I  must  get  into  my 
car  and  speed  through  the  night 
over  some  lonely  road.  Such 
thoughts  fill  me  with  terror 
and  as  a  result  I  act  on  them 
at  once.  Naturally  people  are 
beginning  to  think  I  have  gone 


L 


a  little  cuckooo.  I'm  sorry,  but  I  find  a  certain  consolation  in 
these  wild  night  drives;  and  especially  as  my  car  roars  along 
the  road  by  the  ocean,  susceptible  to  my  slightest  whim, 
fully  under  my  control,  I  feel  that  I'm  Lord  of  All. 

"Watching  the  white  foam  lash  the  rocks,  I  order  my  car 
to  move  faster  and  faster  as  though  to  rush  away  from  the 
terror  of  the  night  even  as  it  hems  me  in.  And  during  those 
moments  I  nearly  fool  myself  into  believing  that  I've  suc- 
ceeded in  crushing  that  restless 
'urge,   that  I've  found  peace. 

"  Sometimes  I  think  that  per 


At  a  glance  this  appears  to  be  the 
picture  of  a  radiant,  happy  girl.  Look 
more  closely  and  you  will  discover  in- 
tense sorrow  in  Joan  Crawford's  eyes 


Joan.'     He  never  makes  me  feel  that  I'm  acting  in  anything 
but  a  normal  manner,  that  I'm  doing  anything  wrong. 

"The  other  day  he  brought  over  a  book  called  'In  Tune 

with  the  Infinite, '  which  has 


i  haps  I'm  just  going  through  a 
period  of  unrest,  and  yet 
sooner  or  later  I  always  realize 
that  I  am  not  only  not  going 
through  a  period  of  unrest, 
but  that  my  nature  has  been 
the  same  since  the  day  I  was 
born,  that  I've  always  known 
this  fear  of  the  future,  this 
haunting  fear  which  drives  me 
on  and  on  .  .  ." 

And  unless  Joan  realizes  that 
peace  is  to  be  found  within  a 
person  and  not  necessarily  in 
material  achievement,  it  rather 
looks  as  though  her  life  will 
develop  into  one  mad,  futile 
quest  for  some  Holy  Grail  that 
her  lips  will  never  touch.  For- 
tunately, through  the  teach- 
ings of  a  friend,  she  is  begin- 
ning to  understand  the  truth. 

"  When  these  moods  are  upon 
me, "  she  continued,  seeming 
to  relax  a  bit,  "I  often  tele- 
phone to  a  dear  friend  and  beg 
him  to  come  over.  He  pos- 
sesses a  great  mind  and  the 
rare  ability  to  listen.  He  lets 
me  rave  on  about  my  troubles, 
troubles  which  to  such  a  man 
as  he  must  seem  pitifully  small, 
and  when  I  calm  down  he  in- 
variably says,  'I  understand 
perfectly.  That's  quite  natural, 


Joan  Crawford  says: 

# 
"I  was  born  with  such  a  terrible  inferi- 
ority complex  that  I  must  keep  doing  things 
to  retain  my  self-respect.  Now  I'm  a  star, 
and  yet  that  mysterious  force  keeps  urging 
me  on  and  on. 

"Marriage  gave  me  a  tolerance  and  pa- 
tience that  up  to  then  I  had  never  known, 
but  it  has  not  killed  that  force  which  drives 
me  on  day  and  night. 

"It  would  be  impossible  for  me  to  enjoy 
having  my  husband  place  me  on  a  pedestal 
and  worship  me.  I  never  could  sit  home 
day  after  day  and  wait  patiently  for  my 
husband's  return  at  night. 

"Don't  think  because  I  have  failed  to 
find  a  certain  illusive  state  of  mind,  I  neces- 
sarily want  to  try  another  marriage.  No 
one  else  is  to  blame.     It's  all  me. 

"Perhaps  there  is  a  new  experience  which, 
when  I  find  and  conquer  it,  will  satisfy 
this  longing  of  mine.  In  the  meantime,  I 
must  try  to  develop. 

"Perhaps  if  I  learn  to  believe  in  myself 
I  shall  lose  my  fear  of  the  future." 


helped  me  through  moments  of 
darkest  despondency.  It's  not 
that  I'm  necessarily  getting 
religion.  It's  only  that  I'm 
gradually  learning  to  believe  in 
things,  in  life,  in  people,  and 
most  especially  in  myself.  This 
friend,  as  well  as  the  book,  is 
making  me  realize  that  unless 
you  believe  in  a  thing  you  can 
never  understand  it,  and  as  a 
result  it  frightens  you.  Fur- 
thermore he's  teaching  me  to 
laugh  at  myself  by  explaining 
why  it's  foolish  to  take  life  so 
hard.  Perhaps  if  I  learn  to 
believe  in  myself  utterly  and 
to  chuckle  at  myself  when  I'm 
doing  something  perfectly  ab- 
surd, I  shall  lose  my  fear  of  the 
future.  Perhaps  I'm  finding  a 
permanent  relief.  If  so,  I  shall 
face  life  bravely." 

And  now,  do  you  consider 
the  hungry,  haunting  look  of 
Joan  Crawford's  face  to  be 
nothing  but  a  superficial  man- 
nerism shrewdly  acquired  for 
the  purpose  of  increasing  her 
box-office  value — or  do  you 
feel  it  reflects  the  torturing 
doubt  in  her  soul? 

Joan  has  always  known  sor- 
row, but  being  an  intelligent, 
as  well  as  a  courageous  woman, 
she  may  eventually  find  hap- 
piness.

Shade  the  face,  and  face  the  shade,  is  our  July  warning. 
If  ever  hair  and  skin  need  protection  it  is  now.  A  broad- 
brimmed  fascinator,  such  as  shields  beguiling  Kay  Francis, 
will  prevent  the  immeasurable  harm  of  an  over-dose  of 
sunburn  and  will  add  something  to  your  personal  charms 
as  well.  But  this  shade  is  not  enough.  Be  sure  that 
glare  from  sunlit  sands,  waters,  spaces,  is  never  reflected 
onto  yourself.  It  will  burn  more  cruelly  than  torrid  suns. 
Kay,  if  you  need  consolation,  is  a  freckle  type.  Screen 
make-up  restores  her  natural  gardenia  skin  tones  on  the 
set,  and  for  evening  a  powder  base  and  deeper-than- 
skin  shade  of  powder  are  her  remedies.

I  'HE  burning  question  in  July  is,  literally,  the  burning  question. 
At  this  time  we  are  all  more  or  less  confronted  with  the  possi- 
•*-  bility  of  our  bronzed,  yellowed,  raspberried,  strawberried  or 
reckled  selves.  It  is  not  a  pleasant  picture;  excessive  sunburn  is  often 
iainfu'1  and  disfiguring,  and  sometimes  it  is  fatal.  Hollywood  knows  the 
ase  of  the  girl  who,  tanned  and  leathered  from  burning  until  her  skin 
oughened  and  pores  closed  entirely,  died  from  poisoning.  This  is  an 
inusual  case,  but  every  summer  brings  its  sun  victims. 

The  regrettable  part  of  this  sunburn  tragedy  is  that  usually  there  is 
io  reason  for  it.  A  becoming  tan,  a  rosy  outdoor  look,  these  will  earn 
ou  compliments  any  day.  But  a  tan  with  alligator-skin  texture,  deep, 
ark  freckles,  a  lobster  hue,  certainly  get  you  nothing  but  the  critical 
omments  of  friends  and  possibly  the  doctor's  office.  I  know  very  well 
he  temptation  of  sprawling  under  a  summer  sun,  of  going  hatless,  of 
asting  yourself  a.  la  naturel  into  sparkling  waters.  But  think  twice 
efore  you  do. 

Think  first  of  the  sunburn  creams  and  lotions,  preventive  and  curative, 
he  oils  that  divert  the  burning  rays  yet  permit  the  degree  of  tan  or 
iurn  you  desire,  and  protect  the  skin  texture.  There  is  magic  in  them, 
:ou  will  agree  after  a  trial.  A  good  sunburn  preparation  and  a  daily 
iming  schedule  whereby  you  gradually  attain  your  tan  will  give  you  a 
ummer  skin  that  others  may  love  to  look  at  as  well  as  touch. 

Hollywood  finds  the  juice  of  fresh  strawberries  a  successful  cure  for 
iurn.  This  juice  is  a  mild  bleach,  takes  out  the  sting.  Fine  for  Holly- 
rood  with  strawberry  season  on  forever,    [please  turn  to  page  47]

and 
Beauty 


Arietta  Duncan,  at  seventeen,  is  on 
the  sure  road  to  beauty  at  forty. 
Notice  her  Rat,  pillowless  bed. 
When  Arietta  sleeps  or  rests,  her 
spine  is  straight,  her  throat  smooth, 
relaxed.  This  position  helps  to 
prevent  a  sagging  chin,  those  lined 
necks  we  see,  even  in  the  young. 
A  thick  pillow  throws  the  neck 
into  unnatural  line,  encourages 
drooping  of  muscles.  You  will 
grow  to  like  your  pillowless  couch 
if  you  will  try  it  for  a  while.  Also, 
there  is  no  beautifier  like  sleep. 
The  quantity  varies  in  most  in- 
stances, but  you  can  soon  discover 
your  own  needs.  Hollywood, 
when  it  works,  is  the  sleepingest 
town  you  ever  knew.  All  lights 
out  by  ten-thirty. 


Anita  Louise  gives  you  a 
lesson  in  relaxation.  Cover 
the  eyes  with  gauze  or  cot- 
ton saturated  in  cold  tea. 
Relax  completely  for  fifteen 
minutes,  preferably  without 
a  pillow.  Marvelous  for 
tired  eyes,  for  lifting  your 
spirits,  revivifying  you.  Eye 
tonic  or  boracic-acid  solu- 
tion is  also  a  great  restorer

Coquettish  veils  require  extra  art  in  make- 
up, thinks  Virginia  Bruce.  Brown  veils  need 
coral  rouge,  lipstick,  warm  powder.  Black 
veils  demand  true  red  tones.  All  veils  need 
more  rouge,  an  iridescent  eye-shadow 


Dressing  up  in  cold  cream  to  be  photo- 
graphed is  Hollywood's  latest  fad,  as 
illustrated  by  Lilian  Bond.  It  gives  the 
face  a  lively  quality.  Constance  Bennett 
and  Ann  Harding  also  appear  a  la  creme 


One  secret  of  Li  1 1  ian 
Roth  s  glowing  skin.  She 
uses  a  soft  toothbrush  and 
soapsuds  at  nostril  and 
chin  areas  to  insure  im- 
maculacy against  oil 


[continued  from  page  45] 
A   strawberry   lotion   or   cream   would 
probably  be  more  convenient  for  most 
of  us. 

Hollywood  is  also  pretty  well  freckled, 
especially  Joan  Crawford,  whispers  a 
little  bird.  But  Hollywood  does  not 
mind  its  freckles.  It  covers  them  for 
work;  it  covets  them  for  play.  The 
cycle  of  artificiality  has  been  run  until 
it  is  refreshing  to  get  back  to  things  put 
on  the  face  by  nature,  such  as  a  freckle. 

O.  K.  Hollywood,  but  for  the  rest  of 
us  let's  limit  them  to  a  mild  sprinkling, 
a  golden  dust  across  the  nose.  Beyond 
that  they  are  a  deterrent  to  skin  beauty 
and  are  often  more  difficult  to  bleach 
away  than  a  brown  or  red  burn. 

On  this  matter  of  burn  Photoplay 
comes  forward,  puts  down  its  foot  firmly 
and  asks  you  not  to  burn  recklessly. 

OPPOSITE  you  will  notice  Lillian 
Roth  and  her  little  tooth-brush 
which,  as  I  have  explained,  she  uses 
for  something  else. 

Lillian  has  let  us  in  on  a  perfectly 
grand  home  facial  which  she  gives  her- 
self about  every  two  weeks.  It  begins 
vvith  cream  to  remove  any  make-up, 
passes  on  to  a  good  soap-and- water 
cleansing  where  the  little  brush  comes  in 
for  nostrils  and  chin,  ends  in  a  thorough 
rinse. 

Next  she  applies  a  hot  towel  to  open 
the  pores  more  thoroughly,  then  paints 
her  face  with  milk  of  magnesia  which 
must  stay  on  until  it  is  dry  like  a  mask 
■ — perhaps  twenty  or  thirty  minutes. 
Lillian  then  washes  this  off  in  clear 
water,  applies  an  astringent.  For  a 
thin,  dry  skin  a  skin  tonic  or  cold  water 
might  be  substituted.

Photoplay  readers  doubt-

while  Claudette  Colbert 
was  getting  this  new  short 
bob.  She  prefers  a  long 
bob,  she  tells  me,  but  has 
been  bobbed  thusly  at 
the  letter  request  from  her 
followers.  A  grand  bob 
it  is,  and  a  grand  dispo- 
sition, Claudette.  The 
hairline  is  revealed  at  the 
neck,  broad  waves  fall 
softly  over  the  cheeks,  and 
the  forehead  hair  is 
brushed  back  to  accent 
that  little  forehead  point. 
Claudette's  hair  is  heavy, 
glossy  and  black 


The  side  views  of  this  coiffure  are  as  interesting  as 
the  front.  The  waves  over  the  cheeks,  which  Clau- 
dette always  affects,  frame  the  face  charmingly  and 
slenderize  the  contour.  When  the  hair  is  drawn 
back  from  the  face  it  is  immediately  enlarged  in 
appearance,  although  this  is  an  amazingly  youth- 
ifying  trick  for  fair-skinned  people.  And  since 
Claudette's  dark  eyes  have  crept  into  the  picture, 
let  me  whisper  that  she  considers  the  daily  use  of  an 
eyewash  necessary  to  health  and  beauty,  and  a 
curling  device  helps  those  lashes  creep  heavenward

of  th

Family 


Don't  miss  a  word  of 
this  fascinating  story 
about  Fredric  March, 
written  by  his  own 
proud  sister-in-law 

By  Mary  Dupuy  Bickel 


DOX'T  spoil  him.     We  mustn't  let  him 
get  spoiled!'' 
That's  what  the  various  members  of 
Fredric   March's   family  —  Frederick 
Bickel  it  was  then — have  been  reminding  them- 
selves and  each  other  ever  since  he  was  little.  To 
them  he  will  always  be  the  baby  of  the  family. 

It  is  only  in  the  last  year  or  two,  since  he  has 
gone  successful  in  a  big  way,  that  they  are  be- 
ginning to  look  at  each  other  and  realize,  now 
that  he  is  grown  up  and  still  not  spoiled,  that 
perhaps  he  is  made  of  stuff  that  doesn't  spoil! 

For  today  he  is  just  as  quietly,  humorously 
modest  as  he  was  the  first  time  I  ever  saw  him — 
when  he  was  fifteen  years  old. 

It  was  during  the  intermission  of  a  tea  dance 
at  the  Alpha  Delt  house  in  Madison,  Wisconsin 
— the  old  Alpha  Delt  house — the  one  on  Langdon 
Street.  I  was  a  co-ed  then,  sitting  on  the  porch 
with  a  young  man  named  Jack  Bickel — quite  a 
nice  person,  I  thought,  never  dreaming  I  was 
going  to  marry  him — when  we  saw  a  boy  coming 
toward  us  across  the  lawn,  and  my  companion 
said,  "I  want  you  to  meet  my  kid  brother.  He's 
up  here  from  Racine  visiting  me."' 

There  was  such  a  lot  of  quiet  pride  in  his  voice 
that  I  knew  this  must  be  a  very  special  family. 

We  watched  him  come,  a  tall,  young  boy  in 


knickerbockers,  with  the  serious,  candid  eves  of  an  idealist, 
and  lips  that  quirked  upward.  His  brother,  smiling  as  he 
watched  him,  said  to  me  in  a  low  aside,  "He's  the  pride  of 
the  family." 

It  was  Freddie  Bickel,  who  later  changed  his  name  to 
Fredric  March,  shortening  his  mother's  maiden  name,  Mar- 
cher, to  do  so. 

Later,  when  I  was  welcomed  into  the  family  as  the  first 
daughter-in-law,  I  decided  it  was  the  closest  family  group  that 
I  had  ever  known.  In  those  days  no  member  of  that  circle — 
three  boys  and  a  girl  and  their  parents  —  could,  or  wanted  to 
decide  anything  of  importance  without  a  conclave  of  all  the 
others.  Father  and  Mother  Bickel  would 
ask  each  other  in  their  soft,  sweet  voices: 
"What  do  you  think,  Cora?"  "What  do 
you  think,  John?"  followed  by  the  oft- 
repeated,  "You  know  best,  dear." 


I  HAVE  a  letter  which  shows  this  closeness, 
which  Fred,  then  a  lovable  youngster, 
wrote  to  his  big  brother,  Jack,  who  was  a 
college  freshman.  After  telling  about  the 
hair  cut  he  got  last  Monday,  and  about 
seeing  Maude  Adams  in  "Peter  Pan,"  ("sat 
in  pit.  50c.  Gee,  it  was  fine!")  he  goes  on 
to  say,  "I  have  been  very  earnestly  watch- 
ing proceedings  between  you  and  fraterni- 
ties. It  may  not  be  any  of  my  business 
and  I  hope  you  won't  get  sore,  but  I 
thought  my  opinion  might  help  a  little.  I 
hope  you  will  not  consider  anything  but 
Alpha  Delt.  I  know  what  H.L.  would  say" 
(that  means  Harold,  the  older  brother, 
already  an  Alpha  Delt) — "to  use  your  own 
judgment.  That's  all  right,  too.  But 
looking  at  it  another  way,  if  I  ever  get  as 
far  as  you  are,  and  have  to  decide  between 
two  fraternities,  yours  and  Harold's,  you 
can  readily  see  it  might  be  a  little  hard 
.  .  .  With  lots  of  love  from  your  kid 
brother,  Fred." 

Needless  to  say,  Jack  pledged  Alpha 
Delt.  No  mere  fraternity  was  going  to 
come  between  these  brothers. 

Freddie,  the  baby  of  the  family,  was  the 
last,  perhaps,  to  outgrow  that  dependence 
on  his  family — his  need  for  advice  in  mak- 
ing his  decisions.    An  amusing  example  of 


Recognize  the  future 
"Dr.  Jekyll  and  Mr. 
Hyde"?  Freddie  when 
he  was  page  boy  in  a 
church  entertainment 


Here's  the  family  to  whom  Freddie  March  (nee  Bickel)  is 
still  the  baby.  (Top  row,  left  to  right)  Harold,  the  oldest 
brother ;  the  father ;  brother  Jack  and  Fred.  (Lower  row) 
Harold's  wife;  Elizabeth,  the  married  sister;  Mary  'Mrs. 
Jack)  Bickel,  the  authoress  of  this  story,  and  Florence 
Eldridge,  Freddie's  wife,  also  of  stage  and  screen 


it  occurred  after  Jack  and  I  were  married  but  still  living  near 
the  University,  and  Fred  was  a  college  student  (another  Alpha 
Delt,  of  course!).  He  traipsed  way  out  to  our  house  one  day, 
a  good  mile  and  a  half,  and  explained,  apologetically  but  very 
much  in  earnest,  the  object  of  his  visit: 

"I  have  to  get  a  note  book,  Jack — and 
what  do  you  think? — shall  I  get  one  that 
opens — •"  (here  he  spread  his  hands  side- 
ways) "this  way?  Or  this  way?"  And  he 
spread  his  hands  up  and  down! 

Naturally,  that  passed  immediately  into 
the  treasure  chest  of  family  jokes. 

For  a  group  as  closely  knit,  as  deep  in 
their  emotions,  as  serious  and  idealistic  in 
their  aims,  they  have  always  had,  however, 
a  marvelous  sense  of  humor. 

ON  my  first  visits  to  their  table,  not 
understanding  them  very  well  at  first, 
I  remember  positively  suffering  with  sym- 
pathy, especially  for  Fred,  who,  as  the 
youngest,  came  in  for  the  most  kidding. 
To  literal  me,  brought  up  in  a  family 
where  we  said  what  we  meant  and  no 
nonsense,  it  seemed  as  if  his  feelings  must 
be  terribly  hurt,  they  were  so  apparently 
brutal  to  each  other,  so  seemingly  sincere 
in  their  cutting  sarcasms.  But  I  soon 
learned  to  enjoy,  with  them,  the  neat 
comebacks  which  Freddie  invariably  had 
at  his  disposal.  With  as  grave  a  face  as 
the  rest  he  would  make  some  devastating 
remark  which  left  them,  for  the  moment, 
speechless.  Until  they  could  gather  their 
forces  for  the  next  attack. 

They  were  like  lambs  in  wolves'  clothing, 
to  reverse  a  good  old  simile.  Perhaps  it 
was  their  apparent  gravity  that  deceived 
me  in  the  beginning.  In  my  family,  if  you 
made  a  joke  you  laughed  as  heartily  as —

RADIO  PATROL— Universal 


INSTEAD  of  a  gangster  tale,  now  comes  the  glorification 
of  the  police  and  an  interesting  glimpse  of  the  other  side 
of  the  picture.  Full  of  suspense,  action,  thrills  and  tragedy; 
a  story  of  an  officer,  tried  and  true,  on  his  daily  beat. 

The  training  of  rookies  for  police  duty,  their  work,  their 
lives,  their  thoughts,  all  bring  a  new  and  refreshing  idea  to 
movies. 

Robert  Armstrong  and  Russell  Hopton  are  both  out- 
standing as  officers,  who  are  buddies  in  their  radio  patrol 
car  and  who  love  the  same  girl.  Bob  wins,  but  weakens  in 
duty  and  accepts  a  bribe.  As  a  result  a  bank  is  plundered, 
an  officer  killed,  and  Bob  himself  redeemed  through  stick- 
ing to  his  post  to  the  death. 

Lila  Lee,  well  and  lovely,  makes  a  fine  comeback.

STATE'S  ATTORNEY— Radio  Pictures 


JOHN  BARRYMORE  is  splendid.  And  you'll  like  the 
J  picture  for  that  reason.  But  the  story  is  so  obviously 
built  to  give  Barrymore  "a  great  characterization" — as  the 
producers  would  say — that  you're  kept  jumping  breathlessly 
from  scene  to  scene. 

It's  about  a  shrewd,  witty  and  unscrupulous  lawyer  whose 
clientele  is  made  up  mostly  from  the  underworld,  but  who 
is  made  district  attorney  and  finally  turns  on  them. 

There  is  nothing  startling  in  this  story,  but  when  you  see 
Barrymore's  inimitable  performance,  you  will  have  had 
your  money's  worth.  William  (stage)  Boyd  plays  the  gang- 
ster, while  Helen  Twelvetrees,  Mary  Duncan  and  Jill 
Esmond  furnish  the  Barrymore  feminine  background.  It's 
an  adult  picture  and  not  for  kids.

A  SUCCESSFUL  CALAMITY— Warners 


THIS  is  neither  unusual  nor  exciting,  but  it  moves  along 
in  a  smooth,  pleasing  fashion,  free  from  dramatic  high- 
lights, but  comfortable  and  homey.  It  will  delight  the 
thousandsof  George  Arliss  followers  who  have  eagerly  awaited 
his  every  picture  since  "  Disraeli.  "  What's  more,  it's  clean— 
a  picture  fit  for  ever>'  member  of  the  family  to  see.  And 
although  it  is  reminiscent  of  "  The  Millionaire, "  it  stands 
firmly  on  its  own  two  feet. 

Briefly,  the  story  concerns  a  wealthy  man  who  returns 
from  abroad  to  find  his  family  in  such  a  whirl  of  social  ac- 
tivities that  he  can't  get  even  a  glimpse  of  them.  From 
the  sage  wit  of  his  valet,  he  learns  that  "only  the  poor  stay 
at  home. "  Whereupon,  you  know  that  he  is  going  to  be- 
come "poor"  instantly.  This  he  does  in  his  sly,  humorous 
manner,  which  keeps  you  interested,  even  though  there  is 
only  one  surprise  development. 

Mary  Astor  is  charming  as  the  wife.  Evalyn  Knapp,  the 
daughter,  shows  great  sincerity  in  her  work.  William  Jan- 
ney  is  the  enthusiastic,  polo-playing  son,  but  the  boy  that 
will  have  you  in  stitches  with  laughter  is  young  Hardie  Al- 
bright, who  plays  the  straight-laced  suitor  in  a  manner  that 
is  worth  the  price  of  admission.  Arliss  has  done  more 
powerful  roles,  but  you'll  like  him,  anyhow.

AS  YOU  DESIRE  ME—M-G-M 


WE  hate  to  write  the  words,  "  This  may  be  the  last  Garbo 
picture  you  will  see, "  but  at  this  moment  it  appears 
that  she  will  not  make  any  more  now  ...  if  ever.  And 
Garbo  has  never  been  more  marvelous;  never  has  she  pos- 
sessed such  youthful  beauty  or  such  wistful  appeal. 

The  story  begins  in  Budapest,  where  a  super-gay  Garbo 
in  a  platinum  wig,  is  the  sweetheart  of  a  depraved  novelist, 
the  latter  played  very  expertly  by  Eric  Von  Stroheim.  Owen 
Moore,  a  friend  of  years  before,  sees  her  and  appeals  to  her 
to  return  to  her  titled  husband  in  Italy,  from  whom  she  was 
separated.  She  joins  her  husband  (Melvyn  Douglas)  even 
though  her  mind  is  befuddled  and  she  cannot  be  certain 
that  she  belongs  there. 

Here  she  appears  without  the  wig  and  looks  like  a  girl  of 
eighteen.  The  photography  throughout  is  like  some  lovely 
painting. 

The  love  scenes  between  Douglas  and  Garbo  are  the  high 
points  of  the  film  and  they  almost  equal  the  ones  played  so 
long  ago  by  Gilbert  and  Garbo. 

If  this  must  be  her  last  picture,  we  are  glad  it  is  such  a 
fitting  swan  song.  And  you  don't  need  us  to  tell  you  not  to 
miss  this  film. 

You  couldn't  be  kept  away!

ATTORNEY  FOR  THE  DEFENSE— Columbia 


IF  you  think  you  are  fed  up  on  courtroom  pictures,  don't 
make  up  your  mind  to  pass  them  by  until  you  have  seen 
this. 

And  don't  miss  the  performance  of  Edmund  Lowe,  who 
carries  off  the  honors. 

Evelyn  Brent  is  seductive  and  does  excellent  work  in 
the  role  of  a  beautiful  woman  of  questionable  morals,  while 
Constance  Cummings  again  acquits  herself  creditably  in  a 
straight  role,  the  stenographer  who  stands  by  her  boss  to 
the  finish.  Dorothy  Peterson  and  Donald  Dillaway  also 
have  important  parts  in  the  story. 

It's  difficult  to  find  anything  new  about  this  story.  It 
has  been  done  so  many  times,  but  it  is  packed  with  suspense 
and  you  won't  want  to  miss  it.    There's  a  surprise  finish.

BRING  'EM  BACK  ALIVE— RKO-Van  Beuren 


WE  have  had  many  animal  pictures,  but  never  one  more 
absorbing  than  the  film  record  of  Frank  Buck's  ex- 
pedition into  the  Malay  jungles.  In  it,  is  an  eight-minute 
fight  between  a  twenty-four  foot  python  and  a  tiger. 

Every  single  frame  of  the  picture  was  made  in  the  jungles 
and  is  absolutely  authentic.  For  years,  Buck  has  been  in 
the  business  of  catching  wild  animals  alive  and  bringing 
them  back  to  sell  to  the  zoos  of  Europe  and  America. 

One  scene  shows  him  capturing  a  baby  elephant  with  his 
bare  hands.  Five  weeks  were  occupied  in  the  preparation  of 
this  scene  alone,  as  it  was  necessary  to  separate  the  herd 
from  the  baby  elephant  and  drive  them  forty  miles  away. 

Here  is  a  picture  that  will  live  a  long  time  after  the  current 
sex  pictures  and  melodramas  are  forgotten.

TAKE  a  good  look  at  the  little  red-headed  fighter,  James  Cag- 
nev,  for  he  says  he  wants  more  money  or  he  will  leave  the 
screen.  Again  he  has  a  sympathetic  role — that  of  a  boxer  who, 
sick  himself,  goes  into  the  ring  to  win  money  to  help  his  sick 
sweetheart.  He  wins,  and  then  goes  haywire  over  a  blonde  fash- 
ion plate  who  deserts  him.  Marian  Nixon  is  appealingas  the  coun- 
try girl  and  Virginia  Bruce  is  easy  to  look  at  in  the  blonde  role. 


A  LITTLE  more  lightning  with  the  thunder  and  this  would 
have  been  a  better  picture.  Tallulah  Bankhead  in  a  too- 
melodramatic  plot  emerges  as  a  finished  actress  and  a  beauty. 
Charles  Bickford,  Paul  Lukas  and  Ralph  Forbes  are  the  three 
men  in  her  life.  There's  an  unhappy  ending,  but  excellent 
acting  by  the  entire  cast.  Not  the  most  thrilling  picture  made, 
but  interesting.

MORE  suspense,  a  building  toward  a  climax  and  swifter 
direction  would  have  made  this  a  winner.  The  story  deals 
with  a  wife  who  refuses  to  postpone  her  divorce  in  order  to  save 
her  husband's  career,  only  to  have  him  blast  the  happiness  of 
her  second  marriage.  Elissa  Landi  as  the  wife,  Ralph  Bellamy, 
Neil  Hamilton  and  Gilbert  Roland  add  strength  and  conviction 
to  an  otherwise  weak  story. 


JOAN  BLONDELL  steps  forward  in  an  entirely  different  role 
and  you'll  love  her.  As  hospital  nurse,  looking  for  something 
to  break  the  monotony,  she  is  sent  to  care  for  a  hysterical  old 
lady  who  has  just  seen  her  nephew  murdered.  George  Brent 
(and  don't  compare  him  with  Clark  Gable!)  plays  the  part  of 
an  inspector.  If  you  like  mystery  stories,  you  can't  afford  to

Whewie!  Just  human,  after  all.  Doug  Fairbanks,  Jr.,  is  fine 
as  the  columnist  who  falls  for  a  pretty  face  (Frances  Dee),  finds 
himself  in  plenty  of  trouble  and  loses  the  girl  in  additior, 
Bouquets  for  Lee  Tracy  as  the  newspaper  pal  and  for  Ann 
Dvorak  as  the  girl  about  a  man's  apartment.  Swell  direction 
wasted  on  a  weak  story. 


NEW  YORK'S  East  Side  is  brought  to  your  door,  along 
with  the  problems  of  a  merchant  named  Cohen,  who  under- 
takes the  care  of  an  orphaned  cripple.  His  great  love  for  this 
child  and  her  devotion  to  him  make  a  human  story  that  tugs 
at  your  heart-strings.  Alexander  Carr  and  the  child,  Betty 
Jane  Graham,  bring  you  plenty  of  tearful  moments.  Splendid 
dramatic  entertainment.

I  'HIS  gets  off  to  a  fine  start,  but  somewhere  on  the  way  it 
■L  loses  sight  of  the  object  of  all  this  splendid  acting  and  falters 
to  the  finish.  Lewis  Stone  and  Laura  Hope  Crews  are  the 
parents  of  Robert  Young  and  Margaret  Perry  (a  bright  new- 
comer) who  try  to  plan  for  their  children's  good,  but  it  doesn't 
work  out  right.  The  direction,  in  places,  fairly  sparkles,  but 
the  story  misses. 


THIS  time  Joe  E.  Brown  is  a  cowboy  from  Texas,  who  hits 
New  York  with  S20.000  which  it  takes  a  slick  theatrical 
producer  only  a  couple  of  hours  to  lift.  Even  if  you  don't  know 
the  show  business,  you'll  laugh  until  your  sides  ache,  so  beware 
of  sprained  ribs.  The  story  is  weak,  but  the  gags— and  rubber- 
faced  Joe — are  swell.    Ginger  Rogers,  the  girl,  is  good.

Don't  Call  Him    Skippy 


IMAGINE  yourself  walking 
right  up  to  the  front  gate  of 
the  Metro  Goldwyn-Mayer 
studio  with  an  appointment  in 
your  pocket  to  interview  Jackie 
Cooper,  no  less.  Of  course,  I'm 
the  lucky  palooka  that  all  this 
happened  to,  but  as  I  was  saying, 
just  imagine  yourself. 

Right  off  the  bat  the  chap  in  the 
front  ollice  looks  over  your  creden- 
tials and  makes  out  a  pass.  Then 
he  buzzes  an  electric  lock  on  a 
thick  walnut  door  and — presto! 
You  are  inside.  Half  a  block  to 
your  left  along  the  narrow  street 
of  the  studio  city  and  you  enter 
the  publicity  bungalow. 

Near  the  bottom  of  a  big  black- 
board inside  the  cool,  spacious  of- 
fice is  a  notice  that  looks  like  the 
fight  announcements  at  the  Amer- 
ican Legion  Stadium.  "Cooper- 
Chandler" — that's  what  it  said. 

I  was  hardly  prepared  for  the 
bout  that  was  to  follow.  Some 
interviewers  have  outlines  of  a 
general  conversation  worked  up 
in  advance;  others  jot  down  a  lot 
of  questions  to  ask;  maybe  some 
of  them  even  have  psycho-analysis 
cards  to  be  filled  out  in  blank 
form. 

Might  as  well  tear  'em  all  up 
when  J.  Cooper  is  the  interviewee. 

Wouldn't  be  worth  two  cents. 

What  a  boy!    What  a  cyclone! 


IT  would  have  taken  two  dicta- 
phones (on  wheels)  to  have  re- 
corded our  conversation  verbatim. 
Nonetheless,  I  found  out  every- 
thing I  wanted  to  know  in  five 
minutes.  The  rest  of  the  dinner 
hour  chatter  was  pure  velvet — 
nothing  stingy  about  Kid  Cooper. 
When  he  hands  out  an  interview, 
it's  a  genuine  man-size  affair.  An- 
other half  hour  and  I  could  have 
written  a  biography  with  several 
volumes  to  cover  Jackie's  quaint 
viewpoint  on  places,  things, 
people  in  general  and  Wally  Beery 
in  particular. 

"  V'know  Wally?"  There  was  a  reminiscent  smile  as  Cooper 
recalled — one  of  those  broad  smiles  that  looks  as  if  it  is  about 
to  explode.  "  Well— I  was  over  at  Wally's  house  the  other  day 
— he  came  walkin'  into  the  room — y'knew  he  had  a  new  baby 
didincha? — sure,  he  adopted  it — well,  y'see  he  came  walkin' 
into  the  room  with  this  little  baby  in  one  hand  (brief  pause  to 
let  the  picture  sink  in),  and  what  d'y's'pose  he  had  in  the  other 
hand?— yeah!  (excruciatingly) — some  diapers!" 

Short  intermission  as  Jackie  scurries  across  the  commissary 
to  shake  hands  with  someone  in  the  next  room,  the  while  we 
are  recovering  from  the  shock. 

"Where  was  I  oh,  yeah — v'know,  I  wanted  to  go  up  in  an 
airplane  with  Wally  once,  and  Mr.  Mayer  wouldn't  let  me  on 
account  of  my  contract,  so  mother  dear  (here  he  rested  his  arm 
affectionately  on  Mrs.  Cooper's  shoulder)— mother  dear  and  I 
went  out  on  Mr.  Mayer's  yacht  a  lot  of  times,  an'  I  caught  a 
fish  that  was  this  big  once  (hand  high  above  head) — honest — 
an'  we  cooked  it  an'  ate  it  right  on  the  boat. 

"  Well,  when  the  boat  started  rocking  just  a  teeny  bit,  mother 


Jackie  Cooper  airs  his 
views  on  life  and  things 

to   Le  Gar e    Chandler 


"Pardon  the  yawn.  Honest,  it's  not  the 
company,  folks,"  says  Jackie  Cooper. 
Noi  is  that  a  yawn  of  boredom  —  for 
Jackie  couldn't  be  bored  when  the  world 
is  so  full  of  exciting  things  like  boats, 
marbles,   jackknives,  tops,   and   strings 


dear  got  tur'ble  scared  an'  seasick 
an' everything — "  Here  Mrs. 
Cooper  interrupted.  "Why 
Jackie,  the  boat  was  rocking 
dreadfully.  We  were  afraid  it  was 
going  to  sink. "  No  reply  from 
Jackie;  only  a  broad  grin  of  toler- 
ant understanding  in  the  direction 
of  his  mother  dear. 

"Did  you  get  seasick?"  I  in- 
quired. 

"Naw  (scrumptiously)  of 
course  not.  I  just  stood  up  on 
deck  all  the  time,  I  did — watchin' 
the  mast  lean  way  over — "  Here 
Master  Cooper  illustrated  the 
acute  angle  of  the  mast  with  a 
knife,  leaning  dangerously  near 
the  level  of  his  mother's  con- 
somme. 


BEFORE  we  had  come  over  to 
the  commissary,  Jackie  had 
been  busy  autographing  a  series  of 
touching  farewell  messages  to  give 
to  members  of  his  company,  thank- 
ing them  for  their  bon  voyage 
wishes  for  the  success  of  a  six  weeks 
vaudeville  tour  in  the  East.  The 
particular  company  upon  which 
Jackie  was  so  fondly  unburdening 
his  feelings  consisted  of  Chic  Sale, 
the  comedian;  Harry  Pollard,  the 
director,  and  members  of  the  cast 
of  "When  A  Feller  Needs  A 
Friend, "  in  which  Jackie  plays 
the  role  of  Limpy  as  a  tragic  little 
crippled  boy,  trussed  in  a  tortur- 
ous leg  brace. 
Jackie  again. 

"V'know,  Chic  Sale  is  s'posed 
to  be  my  great-grandfather — he 
was  in  the  Civil  War  an'  the  Battle 
of  Manila  Bay  an'  maybe  the 
World  War — I  forgot,  but  it  don't 
make  any  difference.  Y'see,  he's 
my  great-grandfather  an'  he 
comes  out  without  even  gettin' 
killed  or  anything.  I  wish,  " 
sighed  Jackie,  "I  wish  they 
wouldn't  make  mesay  'gee'  all  the 
time — I  can't  even  say  'gee  whiz,' 
just  'gee' — an'  then  I  have  to  do 
a  lot  of  crying  besides.  Did  you 
know  (here  Jackie  opened  his  eyes  as  wide  as  an  owl's)  every 
time  I  have  to  cry  it  costs  my  company  ten  dollars!  (Another 
pause  to  allow  me  to  grasp  the  enormity  of  this  terrific  waste  of 
money.)  Yes  sir!  (emphatically)  Y'see,  they  have  to  sit  around 
and  wait  for  me  to  make  up  my  mind  to  cry." 

I  can  well  imagine  Jackie  bursting  into  tears  at  the  sight  of 
his  directors  and  cameramen  sitting  idly  about  because  of  him 
since,  besides  his  mother  dear,  there  is  nothing  that  Jackie 
seems  quite  as  anxious  about  as  "my  company. "

'EAH,  an'  another  thing,  I  have  to  do  a  lot  of  talkin'  with 
my  hands.  "  Jackie  waved  his  right  hand  through  the  air  in 
an  eloquent  flourish  that  would  have  put  to  shame  the  most 
lucid  gesticulations  of  a  Frenchman  or  Italian. 

Those  hands  of  Jackie's  are  very  valuable  appendages.  Tal-" 
lulah  Bankhead,  who  is  one  of  J.  C.'s  most  ardent  admirers, 
goes  into  ecstasies  over  them.    It's  a  fact.

SOME  old  meanies  said  that  Johnny  Weissmuller  can't  play  dress  up 
parts.  So  just  to  show  'em  he  can  look  as  smart  as  the  next  fellow,  he 
had  this  natty  picture  taken  especially  for  Photoplay.  But  this  isn't  the 
way  Johnny  usually  looks.  He  quite  startled  New  York  by  walking

DO  YOU  want  a  hat  you  can  wear  with 
a  dozen  different  costumes?  Here  it 
is,  tipped  smartly  forward  on  Virginia 
Bruce  s  pretty  blonde  head.  The  brim  is 
ballibuntl  straw,  the  crown  is  a  new  angel- 
skin  pique  arranged  in  wide  strips  to  show 
the  hair  here  and  there.  The  brim  rolls  up 
in  back.  That  straighter-over-the-eyes  line 
is  new. 


A  FASH  ION  scoop!  A  first  pose 
of  Garbo  in  one  of  the  striking 
outfits  she  wears  in  her  new  picture 
"As  You  Desire  Me."  And  doesn't 
this  prove  that  Garbo  can  be  glamor- 
ous in  plain  clothes  as  well  as  exotic 
cloth  of  gold? 


STUDY  this  costume  of  Garbo's  closely — but  I  don't  sup- 
pose" I  have  to  tell  you  to  do  that!  It  has  all  the  ele- 
ments of  a  true  sports  outfit  plus  those  little  extra  touches 
that  spell — Garbo!  There  are  the  sleeves  that  blouse  like 
a  smock — the  deep  blue  jacket  with  its  double-breasted 
parade  of  buttons  going  up  to  the  shoulders.  There's  the 
simple  dull-silk  dress  with  boyish  turn-down  collar.  And 
the  beret  worn  visor-fashion  over  the  eyes. 


HERE'S  the  jacket 
sketched  in  de- 
tai  I .  Aren  't  the 
epaulet  sleeves  a 
clever  note? 


SUMMER  is  never  properly  ushered  in  until 
you  can  dress  up  in  a  large  capeline  straw 
hat.  They  not  only  flatter  your  face,  but  your 
frock,  too.  Especially  if  the  frock  is  a  striking 
floral  print  like  this  one  which  Evalyn  Knapp 
wears.  Her  hat  is  ballibuntl  in  natural  color, 
with  a  soft  dipping  brimline  and  shallow 
crown.  This  is  a  favorite  Hollywood  hat  seen 
at  smart  afternoon  gatherings.  The  sole  trim- 
ming note  is  a  colorful  band. 


A  SMALLER  brim  but  the  same  shallow 
crown  distinguishes  Virginia  Bruce's  stun- 
ning hat  shown  in  two  poses  below.  This  is 
the  type  of  hat  you  can  wear  on  warm  summer 
days  with  your  printed  silks  and  sheer  cottons. 
Virginia  wears  it  with  a  cool-looking  floral- 
printed  dress  which  has  ruffly  batiste  collar 
and  cuffs  for  trimming.  This  hat  is  white — the 
cluster  of  blossoms  at  the  back  and  the  bow  in 
front  are  perfect.  Many  summer  hats  have  re- 
vived the  charming  fashion  of  flower  trimming.

THE  new  evening  silhouette  that  is  being  seen 
about  Hollywood  these  nights  is  quite 
straight,  often  with  fullness  coming  directly 
from  the  waistline,  rather  than  molded  as  be- 
fore. Such  a  frock  is  this 
one  of  Mae  Clarke's. 
Deep-ivory  dull  crepe  has 
been  designed  with  skirt 
fullness  starting  from  the 
waist.  A  wide  girdle 
fastens  at  the  back  with  a 
brilliant  buckle.  The  back 
is  cut  low,  but  the  neck- 
line forms  a  cowl  at  front 
where  Mae  pins  a  jeweled 
leaf.    In  "Night  World." 


J — JAVE  you  seen  a  more  charming  summer  dress  than 
•  '  this  one  which  Loretta  Young  wears  in  "Week- 
End  Marriage"?  Pale  blue  satin  has  been  fashioned 
with  a  simplicity  of  line  but  a  subtlety  of  detail.  That 
bateau  neckline,  with  an  organdie  collar,  gives  the 
smart  high  effect  and  is  new.  The  bodice  looks  almost 
box-pleated  in  its  treatment.    Very  youthful. 


WflOrtL 


MERE'S  a    close- 

I  up  of  the 
waistcoat  girdle  on 
Loretta's  evening 
dress.  Like  it? 


\  V/HETHER  or  not  you  have  a  chance  to  play  bridesmaid  as 
"  Anita  Louise  does,  you  should  have  a  delightful  confec- 
tion like  this  for  special  summer  gaieties. 

IT  IS  pink  organdie — and  the  designer  has  made  it  very 
feminine  but  not  too  elaborate.  Ruffles  of  the  organdie 
trim  the  short  cape-like  sleeves  and  outline  the  high  waist- 
line. Two  deep  ruffles  edge  the  long,  full  skirt.  A  sash  of 
orchid  velvet  is  knotted  high  in  front,  falling  from  the  waist 
in  long,  graceful  streamers.  Anita's  wide-brimmed  hat  in  a 
pale  blue  affects  the  eye-tilting  line  that  most  large  hats  show 
this  season.    Flowers  under  the  brim. 


A  NOTHER  of  the  fluffy  frocks  that 
f\  young  things  yearn  over  is  this 
one  Arietta  Duncan  wears  in  "Back 
Street."  It's  cornflower-blue  maline, 
with  flaring  shoulder  caps  in  a  quaint 
wide-shouldered  effect.  Maline  ro- 
settes on  peach  ribbon  form  a  belt.

Wearing    Blue 


THE  tri-color  scheme  of  the  Olym- 
pics is  getting  more  than  a  hand 
in  Hollywood  fashions  these  days. 
Blue  in  practically  every  shade  and 
as  an  accent  is  popular.  And 
stripes  are  the  brightest  note  seen 
both  on  and  off  the  screen.  Florine 
McKinney  bands  her  brimmed 
rough  white  straw  hat  in  the  same 
tri-color  stripes  she  wears  as  a 
scarf  on  her  jacket  dress. 

N  THE  sketch  you  will  see  Flo- 
rine's  dress  with  its  short  dark- 
blue  jacket  and  light-blue  silk  dress. 
Note  that  the  short  sleeves  of  the 
jacket  show  the  dress  sleeves  be- 
neath— clever,  that!  From  "Horse 
Feathers." 


DON'T  miss  Loretta  Young  in  "Week-End 
Marriage" — her  new  clothes  will  show 
you  a  lot  of  clever  costume  tricks.  There  s 
this  striped  girdle,  for  instance.  It  s  a  dif- 
ferent belt  for  silk  frocks.  Wide  at  the  hips, 
the  brilliant  stripes  are  brought  into  a i  belt 
at  front  and  narrowed  in  the  middle  back. 
Worn  on  this  pale  beige  dress  it  is  unusually 
striking.  The  material  of  the  dress  is  a  new 
dull  sports  crepe  in  a  rather  heavy  texture 
with  a  corded  surface.  Loretta  s  corded 
turban  and  accessories  match  a  blue  stripe 
in  the  girdle.

OU  haven't  believed  those  rumors  that  prints 
are  out  of  the  picture  this  year,  have  you? 
Don't,  because  they  bloom  successfully  every  year. 
Arietta  Duncan  chooses  a  youthful  flowered  print 
to  wear  in  "Back  Street."'  The  silk  is  printed  in  small 
flowers  of  blue,  red  and  white.  Pleated  ruffles  sive 
a  crisp  effect.  Trick  arrangement  of  the  white  collar, 
isn't  it? 


HOLLYWOOD  stars  have  adopted  the  little 
jacket  as  their  own  particular  fashion  fad. 
The  briefer  they  are,  the  smarter.  Loretta  Young 
wears  one  in  "Week-End  Marriage"  that  I  want 
you  to  look  for  when  you  see  the  picture.  It's  the 
one  above.  Hardly  more  than  a  bolero,  it  has 
tapering  ends  which  cross  at  front  and  button  on 
the  shoulders  near  the  neckline.  The  sleeves  are 
quite  full,  but  blouse  over  a  tightly  tucked  wrist. 
Cuffs  of  the  navy-blue  dress  material  contrast 
nicely  with  the  eggshell  silk  of  the  jacket. 

REMOVE  the  jacket,  and  lo!  you  have  a  very 
simple  but  charming  short-sleeved  dress.  Al- 
though the  frock,  which  you  will  note  in  the  small 
sketch,  is  without  elaboration,  it  is  cleverly  fitted 
to  the  figure  by  means  of  a  deep  set-in  waistband. 
The  light  silk  of  the  jacket  makes  cuff  banding  on 
the  sleeves. 


Stax 


IN  spite  of  the  ragged  sweater  and  torn  stockings  you  needn't  be  wast- 
ing tears  on  this  little  lad,  for  his  weekly  pay-check  makes  yours — and 
ours — look  as  anemic  as  boarding  house  beefsteak.  "Spanky" — of  "Our 
Gang" — is  one  of  those  natural  born  actors,  and  if  you  haven't  seen  him 
yet,  you'd  better  run  to  the  nearest  theater  for  a  load  of  his  cuteness

Dick  und  Dof  Uber  Alles/ 


Hotel  Central  Bar, 
German  Film  Headquarters, 
Berlin. 

DEAR  Editor: 
Oops!  You've 
gone  and  done  it 
again!  If  you 
hadn't  given  me  a  father's 
curse  and  then  ordered  me 
to  check  up  on  the  motion 
picture  situation  in  Siberia, 
I  never  should  have  run 
head-on  into  the  film  prob- 
lems here  in  Berlin,  Ger- 
many. 

As  it  looks  now,  I'll  never 
even  see  Siberia,  let  alone 
smell  it,  or  even  find  out 
what  the  Siberian  Cinema- 
niacs  think  of  Joan  Craw- 
ford's luxurious  leggery.  I 
am  right  smack  up  to  the 
cowlick  in  the  problems 
which  face  us  American  film 
fans  in  Berlin,  and  it  looks 
as  though  the  job  would 
take  me  all  summer,  pro- 
viding my  elbow  holds  out. 
I've  got  a  charley-horse  in 
it  already. 

When  you  practically 
kicked  me  out  of  New  York, 
editor,  I  took  the  hint.  The 
next  thing  I  knew  I  was  in 
the  grill  room  of  the  Central 
Hotel  (they  call  it  a  "bar" 
here,  for  some  reason). 

Herr  Schramm,  justly 
famous  tender  of  this 
"bar, "  came  over  to  my  table,  where  I  was  cowering  and  leering. 

"What  will  you  haben?  "  he  asked. 

"  I  will  haben  a  small  hooker  of  lemonade,  bitte!"  I  said,  quick 
as  a  twink,  for  my  German  is  even  better  than  my  Russian. 

"We  haben  no  lemonade,  but  we  haben  beer,"  replied  Herr 
Schramm.    "You  are  an  American,  no?" 

"I  am  an  American,  yes, "I  answered,  sticking  seven  inches 
of  nose  into  the  foam.  "The  famous  editor  of  Photoplay  has 
sent  me  to  Siberia!" 

"Ack!"  said  Herr  Schramm. 

"  Ach  me,  too, "  I  said.  "He  wants  me  to  find  out  all  about 
the  Siberian  movie  situation.  " 

"Don't  you  go  one  steppe!"  said  Herr  Schramm,  sticking 
my  trunk  farther  into  the  creamy  suds.  "  What  a  movie  situa- 
tion we  haben  here! " 

AND  have  these  Germans  a  problem — and  it  is  one,  editor, 
with  which  every  American  picture  fan  is  concerned! 

There  aren't  enough  American  movie  comedians  to  go  round! 

You  see,  these  Berliners  want  to  laugh  more  than  anything 
else,  and  there  isn't  a  thing  to  laugh  about  except  movie  comics! 

As  a  result,  they  paste  comedy  prints  together  with  chewing 
gum  and  tire  tape  and  run  them  until  they  fall  into  two-inch 
lengths. 

Here's  an  idea,  editor.  I  was  stag — er,  strolling  up  the  Kur- 
furstendam,  which  is  a  sort  of  Broad- 
way, giving  the  girls  the  loose  eye, 
when  I  saw  a  crowd  milling  around 
and  around.  "A  moider, "  thinks 
I,  "or  at  least  a  good  fight! "  So  I 
ups  to  the  crowd  and  pushes  me 
way  in. 

And  what  do  I  finds?  A  movie 
theater!  It  was  mortifyin',  as  Ant- 
Eater  Durante  says.

They  may  not  be  Garbos  or  Dietrichs  in  Holly- 
wood, but  the  laugh-hungry  German  people  are 
ready  to  vote  for  them  and  throw  out  Von

the  serious  problems  of  this  fretful  world 


PHOTOPLAY'S  traveling 
reporter  gets  his  beer  and 
his  facts  mixed  in  Berlin 


"  Dick  und  Dof, "  say  the 
biggest  letters,  "in  'Hinter

That,  editor,  meant  less 
than  the  dust.  But  on 
pushing  farther  I  found  that 
"Dick  und  Dof"  were  no- 
body but  Laurel  and  Hardy, 
our  old  pals  of  the  kick-in- 
the-pants  school!  And  the 
crowd  was  breaking  noses  to 
get  in!  Imagine  that,  ed- 
itor! Laurel  and  Hardy  run- 
ning neck  and  neck  for 
mayor  of  Berlin — which  is 
some  city,  larger  than 
Painesville,  Ohio,  back 
home! 

They  were  even  billed 
above  a  Chaplin  comedy 
at  the  same  house.  Herr 
Schramm — the  fellow  who 
keeps  this  so-called  "bar" 
— says  it  is  because  so  much 
film  has  rotted  out  of  the 
Chaplin  picture  that  it  only  runs  three  minutes. 

Is  that  a  situation?  And  Harold  Lloyd!  Herr  lieber  donner- 
wetter  und  drang! — which  is,  in  American,  hot  zam!  How  they 
love  that  boy!  He,  too,  is  billed  higher  than  a  kite,  in  letters 
which  make  German  lady  stars  look  like  ten  cent  extras  on  a 
quickie  lot!  Right  down  the  block  from  the  hotel,  he's  ad- 
vertised in  a  film  called  "Harold,  Halt  Dich  Fest!"— which  my 
keen  Teutonic  brain  translates  as  "Hold  Everything,"  or 
words  to  that  effect. 

AND  when  that's  settled,  what  do  you  figure  is  left  for  the 
dramatic  stars?  A  small  plate  of  cabbage  mit  noodles,  and 
no  more. 

Even  such  a  twinkler  as  Marlene  Dietrich — a  real  hundred 
per  cent  German  product  like  beer  and  pretzels,  but  prettier- 
gets  nowhere  in  competition  with  the  comickers.  "Shanghai 
Express"  is  all  over  Berlin  in  German,  Austrian,  Swiss  and 
Bulgarian  versions,  but  nobody  goes  except  the  folks  who 
couldn't  bite  and  kick  their  way  in  to  Laurel  and  Hardy. 

Now,  is  this  a  situation,  editor?     Can  you  imagine  five 
hundred  Laurels  and  Hardys,  all  on  white  horses,  licking  one 
Marlene?    Yet  they  are  doing  it,  right  here  in  Berlin! 
And  that  isn't  all! 

Mavbe  vou  remember  the  German  picture,  "Zwei  Herzen  in 
Drei-Fiertel  Takt,"  or  "Two  Hearts  in  Waltz  Time."  which 

was  such  a  smash  in  America?  It 
was  the  only  Teutonic  tone-film  to 
mop  up  a  fortune  since  talkies 
ruined  the  silent  business! 

Now  they  are  using  almost  the 
same  name  in  everything  they 
make,  just  for  luck.  All  over  Berlin 
a  big  picture  is  showing  which  is 
called  "Zwei  Herzen  und  Ein

Cimarron 


The  Photoplay  Maga- 
zine Gold  Medal  for 
the  best  motion  pic- 
ture produced  in  1931 


WITH  a  landslide  of  votes,  "Cimarron"  runs  away 
with  all  the  honors. 
This  mighty  picture  was  chosen  as  the  best  film 
of  1931  in  the  Film  Daily  trade  journal  poll;  it  was 
given  the  highest  award  by  the  Motion  Picture  Academy  of 
Arts  and  Sciences,  and  now  receives  the  distinction  of  being  the 
choice  of  the  millions  of  picturegocrs  all  over  the  world.  Thus 
the  trade,  Hollywood  itself,  and  now  the  final  critic — the  audi- 
ence— pay  the  highest  tribute  to  "  Cimarron. " 

This  is  the  twelfth  annual  award  of  this  honor.  Photoplay 
Magazine's  Gold  Medal,  which  your  votes  present,  is  the  Nobel 
Prize  of  filmdom,  greatest  distinction  any  film  can  achieve. 


"Cimarron-'  rounds  out  a  dozen  winners  in  this  yearly  insti- 
tution. Previous  winners  were  "Humoresque, ''  1920;  "Tol'able 
David,"  1921;  "Robin  Hood,"  1922:  "The  Covered  Wagon," 
1923;  "Abraham  Lincoln,"  1924;  "The  Big  Parade,"  1925; 
"Beau  Geste,"  1926;  "7th  Heaven,"  1927;  "Four  Sons," 
1928;  "Disraeli,"  1929;  "All  Quiet  on  the  Western  Front," 
1930. 

This  is  a  splendid  array  of  films,  but  "  Cimarron"  ranks  with 
the  best  of  them  and  carries  out  the  Gold  Medal  tradition — for 
it  is  free  from  mawkish  sentimentality — yet  it  is  rich  in  real 
sentiment;  it  is  as  clean  as  Western  air — without  the  cheap 
taint  of  sex  vulgarity;  and,  what's  more  important,  it  is  a

This  enormous  set  was  flung  up  on  a  strip  of  California  desert.  It  is  a  typical  Oklahoma  -boom"  town,  complete  in  every 
detail.  The  town,  known  as  "Osage"  in  the  production  "Cimarron,"  cost  the  Radio  Pictures  Corporation  $100,000  to 
reproduce.    It  was  here  that  most  of  the  action  for  1931's  best  picture  took  place.   Hundreds  of  extras  and  horses  were  used

Wesley  Ruggles, 
whose  direction 
made    "Cimarron" 

motion  picture — done  with  motion  picture 
technique  with  its  dialogue  subservient,  at 
all  times,  to  its  action. 

In  fact  it  has  the  two  elements  that  have 
characterized  every  one  of  the  Gold  Medal 
winners — pure  heart  interest  and  action. 

This  is,  incidentally,  the  first  time  that  a 
Radio  Picture  has  won,  and  Photoplay  con- 
gratulates this  comparatively  new  company 
for  its  daring  to  produce  such  a  picture. 

For  "Cimarron"  broke  many  of  the  iron- 
bound  rules  of  picture  making.  Edna  Ferber's 
great  story,  from  which  the  film  was  made, 
was  acclaimed  as  a  masterpiece  of  literature, 
but  was  thought  to  be  impossible  for  the 
screen.  The  wiseacres  shook  their  heads  when 
the  book  was  bought.  "The  story  is  too 
episodic,"  they  said.  "It  covers  too  long  a 
period  of  time.  Besides,  it  is  a  costume 
picture — and  that  will  never  do!" 

But  its  director,  Wesley  Ruggles,  had  a 


That  stuttering  comedian,  Rosco  Ates.was  brought  to  public  attention  in 
"Cimarron,"  and  has  been  proving  himself  worthy  of  Ruggles'  faith  in 
him  ever  since.    Here  he  is  in  a  powerful  scene  with  Richard  Dix 


Richard  Dix  and  Irene  Dunne  were  perfect 
as  Yancey  and  Sabra  Craoat.  Irene,  then  a 
newcomer,  was  shot  to  stardom.  And  not 
even  Dix's  best  friends  believed  him  cap- 
able of  such  a  remarkable  characterization 


vision  of  a  truly  remarkable  cinema  and,  backed 
by  his  company  (which  had  the  vision,  too),  he 
was  allowed  free  rein  in  bringing  " Cimarron" 
to  the  screen. 

He  chose  Howard  Estabrook  to  write  the 
continuity  and  dialogue — a  wise  choice — for 
Estabrook  stuck  closely  to  the  story  but  trans- 
lated it  into  the  language  of  the  motion  picture. 
He  and  Ruggles  worked  together.  There  was 
a  perfect  affinity  between  director  and  adapter. 

The  result  was  a  smooth  flowing  film  that 
showed  complete  harmony. 

There  are  scenes  which  will  live  always  in 
the  mind.  The  famous  "land  rush"  in  which 
hundreds  of  people,  wagons  and  horses  make 
the  historic  dash  for  the  new  country — Okla- 
homa— ranks  with  the  finest  screen  moments, 
including  D.  W.  Griffith's  famous  ride  of  the 
clansmen  in  "The  Birth  of  a  Nation. " 

Perhaps  only  those  who  worked  on  the 
picture — and  it  was  an  organization  picture, 
with  every  member  of  the  company  sure  of  its 
greatness — know  the  terrific  effort  it  entailed. 
A  total  of  42,000  extras  were  used — including

What!  More  Olympic  Swimmers? 


No,  just  three 
Hollywood  beau- 
ties playing  at 
Malibu.  Note  the 
boyish  look  of 
the  beach  attire 


"I'm  her  best  friend  and  severest  critic,"  said 
Rubberneck,  the  big  inflated  hound,  as  he  gazed 
fatuously  at  Bette  Davis.  Bette,  who  has  been 
busy  carving  out  a  big  success  for  herself  lately, 
takes  the  sun  in  the  briefest  of  the  one-piece  bath- 
ing suits.  It's  a  tweed-knit  in  white  and  the  belt 
ingeniously  crosses  through  the  low  sunback 
decolletage  to  fasten  in  front.  Rubberneck  re- 
marked that  white  is  one  of  the  favorite  bathing 
suit  colors  with  the  stars,  along  with  red  and  blue 


Adrienne  Dore  is  crazy  about  the  beach  and  beach 
clothes.  She  has  any  number  of  clever  suits,  each 
entirely  different  in  coloring  and  style.  For  both 
sunning  and  bathing,  she  likes  this  bright  red  and 
white  suit  with  its  halter  neck.  The  back  is  cut 
low  enough  to  allow  a  liberal  suntan.  Notice  how 
the  white  is  carried  out  in  a  design  at  the  front.  A 
brief  skirt  covers  the  trunks  beneath.  And  when 
sunning,  Adrienne  keeps  her  waves  in  place 
by  a  printed  scarf  which  she  ties  about  her  head

You  would  think  every- 
one was  in  training  to  be 
an  athlete  the  way  exer- 
cise is  being  taken  seri- 
ously at  Malibu.  Beach 
clothes  are  of  the  most 
practical  type.  One  of 
the  popular  fads  is 
Olympic  shorts  like 
those  track  stars  wear. 
They  either  lace  or  but- 
ton like  these  Ruth  Hall 
is  wearing  —  shirts, 
sweaters  and  quite  often 
a  bandana  bib  form  the 
top  half  of  the  costume. 
Joan  Blondell  has  a 
whole  wardrobe  of  shorts 
in  various  colors  with 
bibs   similar    to    Ruth's 


That  Dore  girl  certainly  knows  her 
beach  and  yachting  fashions. 
Here  she  is  all  dressed  up  and 
looking  for  a  yacht !  She  tops  the 
popular  white  flannel  slacks  with 
a  swagger  nautical  white  coat  in 
three-quarter  length.  Slacks  have 
stolen  the  show  from  beach 
pyjamas  this  year — they  are  worn 
over  bathing  suits,  sweaters  or 
shirts.  Adrienne  has  another  coat 
in  bright  red  she  wears  with  these 


Does  the  higher  waistline  appear 
in  beach  clothes?  Decidedly,  look 
at  this  smart  blue  and  white  suit 
Adrienne  Dore  wears.  A  high 
tide  in  blue  marks  the  waistline 
here,  which  is  further  emphasized 
by  the  clever  detail  of  white 
buttons.  The  white  top  has  a  mod- 
erately low  neckline  outlined  in 
blue  stitching.  Again  you  will  note 
that  Adrienne  prefers  a  brief  skirt 
to   the   strictly  one-piece    effect

A  Bathing  Suit? 


SYLVIA  is  known  throughout  the  world  as 
the  beauty  marcel  of  Hollywood.  She  is 
responsible  for  many  of  the  beautiful  figures 

you  see  on  the  screen.  For  the  past  five  or  six 
years  she  has  been  making  the  stars  lovely  and 
she  has  received  as  high  as  $100  for  a  half- 
hour's  treatment.  She  is  the  masseuse  de  luxe 
of  the  film  colony.  But  now  she  devotes  her 
time  to  teaching  women  and  girls  throughout 
the  United  States  how  to  do  for  themselves  what 
she  has  done  for  the  actresses.  And  hundreds 
of  readers  of  Photoplay  express  delight  with 
results.  Sylvia  is  ninety-five  pounds  of  con- 
centrated energy,  and  the  magic  of  her  reducing 
and  form-remedying  knowledge  is  imparted  to 
you  each  month  on  these  pages.  Photoplay 
is  the  only  magazine  for  which  she  writes. 


By  Sylvia 


do  you  look  in  a  bathing  suit?  Here  it  is  summer  and  you've 
got  to  look  nice  on  the  beach.  But  do  you?  Take  stock  of 
yourself,  you  in-between  girls,  and  then  get  to  work. 

And,  incidentally,  you  fat  girls  and  you  thin  girls  can  listen 
in  on  Aunt  Sylvia's  little  lecture.  It  won't  do  you  a  bit  of 
harm.  I'm  going  to  tell  you  how  to  reduce  the  lumps  on  your 
figure  and  how  to  fill  out  the  holes. 

Dozens  and  dozens  of  famous  film  stars  have  come  to  me 

simply  to  reduce  certain  parts 


Squeeze  Off  Extra  Flesh 


I'VE  told  you  fat  girls  that 
unless  you  take  off  the  ex- 
tra weight,  your  brains  are 
as  fat  as  your  bodies. 

I  haven't  been  any  too  kind 
to  you  thin  girls,  either.  But 
your  letters  tell  me  that  I  have 
shown  thousands  of  thin  and  fat 
girls  the  road  to  lovely  figures. 

Now  I've  a  special  message 
for  the  in-between  girls.  Don't 
think,  just  because  your  weight 
and  height  conform  to  those 
silly  charts,  that  you  can  sit 
back  smugly  and  say,  "I  don't 
need  to  diet  or  take  exercises. 
My  weight  is  correct  for  my 
height. "  Listen  to  Sylvia,  in- 
stead. 

Now  stand  in  front  of  your 
mirror.  Take  a  good  long 
look  at  yourself.  You're  not 
so  fine  as  you  thought  you 
were,  are  you?  No,  you're  not 
fat.  Neither  are  you  thin. 
You're  just  in-between — but 
that  doesn't  mean  you're  per- 
fect, not  by  a  darn  sight. 

Look  at  yourself  closely. 
You  have  a  flat  chest.  Your 
abdomen  sticks  out.  There's 
a  lump  of  flesh  on  your  hip 
bone.  Your  legs  are  skinny 
and  there  are  flabby  muscles  on 
the  inside  of  your  legs.  Well, 
you'd  better  do  something 
about  it  and  do  it  quick! 

I'll  wager  that  you  probably 
look  very  fine  in  a  smart  eve- 
ning dress  especially  designed  to 
show  off  your  best  points  and 
conceal  your  defects.    But  how

A  close-up  of  the  most  famous  pair  of  hands  in  Holly- 
wood. These  fingers  have  moulded  the  figures  of 
hundreds  of  stars.  Powerful  and  supple  are  Sylvia's 
hands,  but  you  can  do  for  yourself  what  she  has  done 
for  the  stars.  Says  Sylvia,  "Any  stubborn  lump  of 
fat  can  be  squeezed  off  as  I  am  doing  here — and  that 
goes  for  arms,  legs,  hips,  thighs,  stomach — any  part 
of  the  body  except  the  bust.  Take  up  handfuls  of 
flesh  and  squeeze  hard — then  let  it  slip  through  your 
fingers  like  mashed  potatoes.  You  can  smash  off 
the  fat  cells.  Get  to  work,  girls,  and  get  rid  of 
the   lumps.    You   can   if  you  really  try  hard" 


of  their  figures.  They  have 
said  I  have  worked  miracles  on 
them.  But  if  you  do  what  I 
tell  you,  you  can  be  your  own 
miracle  worker.  Ready?  Nbw 
listen. 

THE  first  thing  to  do  is  to 
start  on  a  good  diet — one 
that  will  give  you  plenty  of 
nourishment  and  plenty  of  pep 
and  will  keep  you  at  an  average 
weight.  (I'm  talking  to  the  in- 
between  girls  now — you  fatties 
and  you  skinnies  stay  on  the 
diet  I've  already  given  you.) 
While  you're  on  the  diet,  start 
working  on  the  lumps.  Here's 
the  building-up  and  nourishing 
diet  for  the  in-betweens. 

Breakfast 

Glass  of  water. 

Dish  of  strawberries  or  any 
other  kind  of  berries  with  a 
little  brown  sugar  (no  cream) 
or 

Cantaloupe  or  any  other 
melon  with  a  few  drops  of 
lemon  juice  (no  prunes,  plums 
or  apricots). 

Half  a  glass  certified  milk. 

One  coddled  egg.  (To coddle 
an  egg.  boil  water  in  a  pan, 
shut  off  flame  underneath  it. 
Put  egg  in  the  water  and  cover 
pan  with  a  top.  Leave  egg  in 
for  ten  minutes.  This  is  the 
healthiest  way  to  prepare 
eggs.) 

Two  slices  of  whole  wheat 
toast  with  butter. 

Cup  of  coffee  with  brown 
sugar  and  cream. 


To    Build    Up    And    S hap  en    The 


Legs    And    Hips 


To  build  up  and  shapen  the  calves  of  the  legs,  hips  and  thighs  take  this 
exercise,  which  I  call  the  scissors  movement.  First  lie  on  the  floor  in 
the  position  that  I'm  in  here,  place  both  hands  under  your  hips  to  raise 
the  hips  up  and  spread  the  legs  as  wide  apart  as  you  can  get  them 


Luncheon 

Half  a  head  of  lettuce  and  half  an  avocado.  Over  this  pour 
two  heaping  tablespoons  of  cottage  cheese  in  which  sour  cream 
has  been  stirred.     Salt  and  pepper. 

Jello  with  thin  coffee  cream.    Iced  tea. 

Dinner 

Cup  of  jellied  soup.    Double  French  lamb  chop,  broiled 

or 
Small  steak,  broiled  or  Two  small  pieces  of  broiled  fillet  of  sole 

or 
Broiled  liver  or  whatever  meat  agrees  with  you. 
Two  heaping  tablespoons  green  lima  beans  or 
Small  baked  potato  and  be  sure  to  eat  the  skin  (if  large 


Now  pull  legs  together  as  you  see 
me  doing.  Then  stretch  legs  out 
again  ani  cross  left  leg  over  right 
leg — that  is,  reverse  the  position 
of  legs.  This  works  very  fast  and 
just  like  a  scissors.  One  two  and 
one  two,  etc.,  fifteen  or  twenty 
times  a  day  and  you'll  get  results 


baked  potato  scoop  out  middle  and  eat  the  rest,  including  the 
skin). 

Two  heaping  tablespoons  of  steamed  turnip  tops. 

Eight,  stalks  of  asparagus  (on  all  vegetables  you  can  have 
butter,  put  on  cold  after  the  vegetables  are  off  the  fire. 

Lettuce  and  cucumber  salad  with  French  dressing. 

Small  dish  of  fresh  fruit  with  brown  sugar  and  cream.  (If 
you  use  canned  fruits,  pour  off  the  juice  and  take  a  few  drops  of 
lemon  juice  before  eating  the  fruit.    Use  no  sugar.)

To   Reduce    Upper 
Leg  and   Thighs 


Lie  in  the  position  I  am  in  here,  rais- 
ing the  hips  with  the  hands  under- 
neath. Slowly  draw  the  right  knee 
forward  and  lower  the  left  leg — but 
don't  touch  the  floor,  yet.  Now 
reverse,  drawing  the  left  knee  for- 
ward, toward  the  chest,  and  lowering 
the  right  leg  to  about  three  inches 
from  the  floor.  Then  put  both  heels 
on  the  floor  and  relax.  You'll  need  to 
relax.  This  is  one  of  the  most  tiring 
exercises  I've  given  you — but  it  abso- 
lutely will  do  the  work.  It  will  also 
reduce  the  stomach.  Do  the  com- 
plete exercise  only  about  three  times 
at  first — working  up  to  as  many  times 
as  you  can  stand.  But  concentrate  on 
the  part  you  want  reduced  and  feel 
those  muscles  pull!  You'll  be  tired 
for  a  few  minutes  when  you've  fin- 
ished.    But  it  takes  off  lumps,  too

Marian  Nixon  and  Janet 
Gaynor.  Great  friends 
and  they  look  alike — but 
they  are  different.  Marian 
more  the  woman  and 
Janet  the  dreamy  little 
girl.  Theirs  is,  surely,  a 
strange  and  tangled  story 


Marian  and  Janet 


WHEN  "After  Tomorrow" 
was  shown  throughout 
the  United  States,  ardent 
movie-goers  began  ask- 
ing each  other,  "Where  has  Marian 
Nixon  been  hiding?  " 

"Why  wasn't  that  girl  discovered 
before?" 

"  What's  kept  her  off  the  screen  so 
long — why,  she  has  the  same  sweet  and  poignant  charm  that 
Janet  Gaynor  has." 

"  Marian  Nixon  and  Charlie  Farrell  are  a  lovely  team." 

The  answer  to  these  questions  and  opinions  is  found  in  an 
amazing  chain  of  circumstances,  a  couple  of  flukes  of  Fate  and 
plenty  of  "  What  would  have  happened  if — "  For  not  so  many 
years  ago,  Marian  Nixon  was  a  star  and  Janet  Gaynor  was  an 
extra  girl.  And  not  so  many  years  ago  Marian  played  Lady 
Bountiful  and  sent  Janet  to  apply  for  a  part  for  which  Marian 
was  wanted  but  couldn't  take.  The  part  was  that  of  Diane  in 
"  7th  Heaven." 

What  would  have  happened  if  Marian  could  have  taken  that 
part?  Would  she  have  skyrocketed  her  way  to  stardom  and 
would  Janet  have  kept  on  being  an  extra  girl?  Ill  leave  that 
poser  to  folks  with  a  lot  of  spare  time  and  get  on  with  the  story 
of  Marian,  Janet  and  Fate. 

Ten  years  ago  Marian  and  Janet  were  unknowns.  Marian 
had  come  to  Hollywood  in  a  vaudeville  act  that  found  itself 
suddenly  stranded  in  Los  Angeles.  She  became  an  extra  in 
pictures.  Janet  was  also  an  extra  and  occasionally  danced  in 
theater  prologues  to  help  out  with  family  bills. 

So  these  two  girls  started  from  scratch,  as  thousands  of  others 
have  done,  with  nothing  but  pretty  faces,  charm  and  ambition. 

But  Marian  struck  a  faster  pace  than  Janet,  got  herself 
noticed  by  good  work  and  good  behavior  and  was  rewarded  by 
a  one-year  contract  with  Fox.  Janet  kept  on  being  an  extra  for 
a  year,  while  Marian  got  some  good  parts — good  for  a  beginner. 

Janet,  Marian,  Janet's  boy  friend  and  I  were  pals  and  that 
year  we  were  together  almost  constantly.  It  was  along  toward 
the  end  of  Marian's  contract  that  we  went  to  the  theater 
together  one  night  to  see  the  stage  play,  "7th  Heaven."  We 
were  especially  interested  because  Marian  had  been  promised 
the  role  of  Diane  in  the  film  version,  provided  she  re-signed  with 
Fox.  I  remember  we  all  talked  about  what  a  good  opportunity 
it  would  be  for  her  and  how  well  she  could  handle  the  role.

Fate  played  in  the

guised very  neatly  as  the  Universal 
Studios,  stepped  in  and  offered 
Marian  a  contract  at  twice  the  money 
she  had  been  offered  for  a  new  Fox 
contract.  Marian  took  the  cash  and 
let  the  credit  go. 

With  Marian  gone,  Fox  was  having 

trouble   casting   two   of  its   biggest 

pictures,  "Johnstown  Flood  "  and  "  7th  Heaven."    That  studio 

tried  to  borrow  Marian  from  Universal  but  Universal  said 

"Nix." 

Marian  thought  of  her  friend  Janet,  got  her  on  the  phone  im- 
mediately and  told  her  to  go  at  once  to  Fox  and  apply  for  both 
jobs.  She  got  them  and  rode  instantly  to  fame,  while  Marian 
strung  along  in  second  rate  roles  that  never  once — with  the 
possible  exception  of  Richard  Barthelmess'  "Young  Nowheres" 
— brought  out  all  of  her  talent  and  charm. 

Janet  became  a  star  after  "7th  Heaven."  Marian  was 
merely  a  capable  leading  woman.  Janet  followed  "7th 
Heaven"  with  "Street  Angel,"  "Sunrise,"  "Sunny  Side  Up." 
"Daddy  Long  Legs,"  etc.,  etc.  Janet  was  an  important  per- 
sonage, a  money-maker  for  her  studio,  a  real  screen  find. 

And  Marian — who  might  have  had  the  role  of  Diane — found 
herself  going  down  the  other  side  of  the  hill  of  fame.  Each  time 
that  she  thought  she  was  to  come  into  her  own,  something 
happened.  She  received  a  good  salary,  but  no  glory.  And  for 
the  last  several  years  she  has  been  just  one  of  the  many  good 
leading  women  who  are  consistently  forgotten  when  good  parts 
come  along. 

THIS  might  have  been  the  end  of  the  story,  except  that  Fate — 
the  zany — had  a  few  more  threads  to  weave  together  before 
she  was  through  with  Marian  and  Janet. 

Janet  was  assigned  the  co-starring  role  with  Charlie  Farrell 
in  "After  Tomorrow,"  but  Janet  was  making  one  of  her 
periodical  decisions  to  get  away  from  the  honeycoated  heroines 
and  prove  herself  a  real  actress,  so  she  turned  the  part  down  and 
Marian  took  it — just  as,  years  ago,  Marian  had  given  up  "  7th 
Heaven"  and  Janet  had  taken  that. 

What's  more,  Frank  Borzage  was  given  the  job  of  directing 
the  new  Nixon-Farrell  team.  Just  to  make  things  more  tangled 
up  than  they  already  are,  it  was  Borzage,  you  remember,  who 
brought  Janet  and  Charlie  to  fame  [  please  turx  to  page  115  ]

An  Extra  Girl's  Diary 


HAVE  you  ever  wondered 
what  an  extra  girl  thinks 
about? 
About  the  stars,  you've 
read  everything.  You  know  what 
they  wear,  whom  they  love,  what 
they  think  of  this  and  that,  what 
they  cook  (if  any)  and  eat,  how  they 
live — you  know  the  stars  better,  you 
movie  fans,  than  you  do  your  next- 
door  neighbor. 

But  the  extra  girl  you  don't  know 
at  all.  And  for  every  star  in  Holly- 
wood, there  are  hundreds  of  them  — 
each  of  them  working,  living,  think- 
ing kids.  Each  of  them  cherishing  in 
her  heart  the  hope,  the  wish,  perhaps 
the  conviction  that  some  day  she, 
too,  will  be  a  star. 

And  so  few  of  them  ever  make  the 
grade.  Once  in  a  while,  one  of  them 
pops  her  head  up  over  the  mob,  starts 
climbing  the  ladder  to  the  heights. 
How  far  up  she  gets  is  a  matter  that 
depends  on  her — and  luck.  And  one 
such  is  Ann  Dvorak. 

Ann  Dvorak  isn't  really  her  name 
— it's  just  the  name  she 
took  because  she  didn't 
want  people  to  know 
whose  daughter  she  is. 
Her  mother  is  Anna 
Lehr,  as  Photoplay  told 
you  last  month.  She  was 
a  star  in  the  days  when 
the  name  "Yitagraph" 
meant  big  things  in 
movieland.  But  Ann, 
graduating  from  high 
school,  her  heart  set  on 
a  movie  career,  didn't 
want  to  crash  her  way  on 
her  mother's  name.  So 
she  reached  back  into 
half  of  that  Irish-Czech 
ancestry  of  hers  and 
chose  Dvorak,  of  all 
names. 

She  started  at  the  bot- 
tom— an  unknown,  like 
countless  other  girls  who 
struggle  in  Hollywood. 
She  must  have  something 
— because  today  Ann 
Dvorak's  head  is  above 
the  mob. 

She's  the  girl  who  was 
the  sex-appeal  in  "  Sky 
Devils.  "  You'll  thrill  to 
her  exotic  allure  in  "  Scar- 
face"'  and  "The  Strange 
Love  of  Molly  Louvain.  " 
Already,  the  fans  are 
writing  in,  asking  to 
know  about  this  "differ- 
ent'' girl  they've  seen  on 
the  screen.  Ann  Dvorak's 
In-art  is  leaping  high  with 
hope.  How  far  she's  go- 
ing to  climb  the  ladder 
she's  started,  time  alone 
can  tell. 

But   that's   not   what

An  amazing  self-told  tale 
of  one  girl's  heart-break- 
ing climb  up  the  slip- 
pery Hollywood  ladder 

By  Ben   Lloyd 


Ann  Dvorak,  who  recently  married  Leslie  Fenton,  de- 
spaired of  ever  having  a  studio  seat  with  her  name  on  it 


this  story  is  about.  This  story  is  to 
give  you  what  you  rarely  get — a 
glimpse  into  the  heart  and  mind  of  an 
extra  girl.  For,  during  the  days  when 
she  was  just  one  of  the  thousands, 
Ann  Dvorak  confided  her  hopes,  her 
heart  secrets,  to  a  little  blue  book, 
her  diary.  And,  to  anyone  who  is 
interested  in  Hollywood  and  its  peo- 
ple, some  of  the  things  she  has  written 
there  are  a  revelation — both  of  Holly- 
wood and  of  Ann  Dvorak. 

It  begins  back  in  1928,  when  she- 
graduated  from  school.  She  wanted 
to  be  a  movie  actress.  At  first,  she 
asked  her  mother  for  help.  There's 
this  entry  in  mid- 1928: 

"  Made  an  appointment  (or  rather, 
mother  did)  to  see  Douglas  Fair- 
banks. Imagine  it!  One  girl  out  of  a 
hundred — nay,  two  hundred! — gets  a 
chance  to  see  a  man  like  he  is.  That 
is,  they  never  can  see  him  in  his 
private  office  and  have  a  little  talk 
about  themselves.  I'm  lucky,  that's 
all,  in  having  a  mother  who  knows 
these  people  personally. 

"Mr.  Fairbanks  is  a 
very  courteous  and  in- 
teresting man.  He  is  very 
handsome,  too.  He  wore 
a  little  black  beret,  and 
his  face  was  tanned  to  a 
dark  brown.  He  has  a 
very  pleasant  laugh, 
which  I  found  out 
through  his  amusement 
over  my  extreme  youth 
and  inexperience. 

I  HAVE  found  out  that 
the  really  big  people — 
that  is,  those  who  amount 
to  something  and  who 
have  a  great  deal  of  re- 
sponsibility—  are  the 
ones  most  likely  to  be 
tolerant  and  understand- 
ing. Some  little  fortieth 
assistant  director  would 
probably  have  just  taken 
my  name  and  address, 
shooed  me  out  of  the 
studio,  and  thrown  away 
the  paper  he  had  written 
it  on.  Instead,  Mr.  Fair- 
banks introduced  me  to 
his  secretary,  and  she  is 
going  to  attend  to  the 
details  of  my  costume 
and  wigs,  etc.  for  a  test. 
You  see,  they  are  mak- 
ing a  picture  of  the  Louis 
XIII  and  XIV  period. 
Oh  God,  I  hope  I  photo- 
graph well  enough  ..." 
That  same  day  she 
turned  critic:  "I  saw 
John  Barrymore  in  'The 
Tempest.'  He  just  misses 
being   marvelous.

s  so  easy  to  Keep 

your  skin  lovely  at  home... 

MRSJOHN  DA  VIS  LODGE 


New  York  society  leader  shows  you  how  she 
gives  herself  a  beauty  treatment  .  .  . 


Fresh  and  flawless  as  a  tea 
rose,  Mrs.  Lodge's  complexion  is  as 
uniquely  lovely  as  her  long  golden 
hair,  like  Melisande's. 

She  gives  herself  her  daily  beauty 
treatment  in  her  own  home. 

"Cleansing,  first,"  she  emphasizes. 
"Yes,  and  here's  what  gets  the  skin 
really  clean — Pond's  Cold  Cream. 
No  matter  what  price  you  pay,  noth- 
ing else  cleanses  so  marvelously! 

"Relax  .  .  .  Now  wipe  away  the 
cream.  How?  With  Pond's  Cleans- 
ing Tissues!  They  are  much  softer. 
Pond's  Cold  Cream  and  Cleansing 
Tissues  are  all  you  need  for  exquisite 
cleanliness. 

"But  the  skin  needs  stimulating, 
too,  to  keep  it  looking  young.  Pat, 
pat  with  Pond's  Skin  Freshener.  To 
refine  pores — pep  up  your  color. 


"Finished?  Not  yet!  Protecting  — 
that's  what  our  skin  needs  next — 
to  keep  it  fine  and  smooth.  Pond's 
Vanishing  Cream  gives  this  necessary 
protection.  Invisibly!  It  gives  the 
loveliest  peach-bloom  finish,  and  you 
needn't  powder  again  for  hours. 

"That's  all  I  do — never  neglect 
this  simple  routine.  And  always  re- 
peat it  after  exposure. 

And,  of  course,  at  bedtime! 
That's  a  special  ritual.  Cleansing 
always  with  Cold  Cream  and  Tissues 
to  remove  the  day's  grime.  Then 
smooth  in  fresh  Cold  Cream  to  soften 
and  lubricate.  Leave  on  overnight. 

"You  see,  the  skin  needs  four  things 
to  keep  it  lovely — Cleansing,  Lubri- 
cating, Stimulating,  Protecting.  Just 
these f  our  preparationsareall  you  need. 
It's  so  easy— just  in  your  own  home!"

SANITARY    NAPKIN 

(U.  S.   Pal.   No.  1,857,854) 

Re-designed  to  end  ail  fear  of  revealing 
outlines,  no  matter  how  close-fitting  the 
gown,  how  filmy  the  silks  you  wear 
. . .  soft,  as  always,  and  easily  disposable. 


AT  LAST!  A  radically  new  de- 
sign in  sanitary  protection.  You 
i  are  scarcely  aware  you  have  it 
on.  Made  by  Kotex— originators 
of  the  modern  sanitary  napkin. 

It  is  called  PHANTOM 
KOTEX.  Why?  Because  it  is 
so  flattened  and  tapered  that  it 
leaves  no  outlines  even  under 
the  closest- fitting  of  evening 
gowns.  Not  the  slightest  bulk 
suggested  even  under  the  film- 
iest of  summer  silks. 

Remember  how  often  an 
evening  has  been  spoiled  be- 
cause of  your  discomfort?  Self- 
consciousness?  That  feeling  of 
a  supposedly  smooth-fitting 
frock  marred  by  revealing  out- 
lines? That's  unnecessary  now! 
The  new  PHANTOM  KOTEX 
sanitary  napkins  fit  smoothly, 
perfectly,  inconspicuously. 

Kotex  features  retained 

I  The  special  Kotex  features  are 

!  retained,  of  course.  It  is  soft 

>  even  after  hours  of  use ;  won- 

,  derfully  absorbent;  treated  to 

deodorize;  can  be  worn,  with 

equal  protection, on  either  side; 

disposable,  easily. 

Today— American  women 

;use  more  than  twice  as  many 

Kotex  pads  as  they  do  all  other 

sanitary  pads  combined.  More 


than  24  million  pads  were  used 
in  hospitals  alone  last  year. 

Ask  for  the  new  PHANTOM 
KOTEX.  Try  it.  Learn  what  a 
difference  it  makes.  Insist  upon 
getting  genuine  Kotex,  when 
you  buy  it  wrapped.  Each 
tapered  end  of  the  new  pad  is 
stamped  "Kotex"— so  you  can't 
get  inferior  substitutes. 

Kotex  prices  are  today  the 
lowest  in  Kotex  history.  This 
new  improvement  comes  to 
you  at  no  increase  in  price.

ing up  skin  blotches  and  acid  bumps.  A  cream 
also  now  includes  this  healing  property. 

A  CONCEIT  from  Paris  that  might  have 
•**•  appeal  in  Hollywood  is  a  nose  veil  with 
eyebrows  attached  to  suit  mood  and  occasion. 
I  have  told  you  how  players  often  remove  their 
own  entirely  to  facilitate  screen  make-up. 

TOW"  CRAWFORD  appeared  at  the  Holly- 
I  wood  premiere  of  "Grand  Hotel,"  sponsoring 
that  little  foible  I  told  you  of  recently — a  well- 
oiled  face.  Try  it  the  next  time  you  wear  an 
evening  gown,  with  a  little  extra  eye  make-up 
and  a  bright  lipstick.  See  what  it  does  for  you. 

WARLENE  DIETRICH  curls  the  ends  of 
-IV1  her  hair  by  dampening  them  with  toilet 
water,  twirling  the  ends  the  way  she  wants 
them  to  go  and  pinning  them  until  dry.  And 
speaking  of  toilet  water,  now  is  the  time  when 
you  will  find  it  especially  refreshing.  A  light 
fragrant  toilet  water  seems  just  the  frivolous 
touch  with  tennis  frocks,  golfing  togs  and  other 
outdoor  apparel. 

IN  SPITE  of  cunning  bathing  caps  and  good 
resolutions  the  hair  invariably  gets  more 
salt  immersions  at  this  time  of  the  year  than  is 
good  for  it.  If  we  conscientiously  rinsed  every 
bit  of  salt  from  it  after  every  swim,  that  would 
prevent  most  of  the  havoc.  But  we  don't,  and 
we  wonder  when  it  gets  dry,  lifeless  and  color-

An  atmosphere  of  romance  and

less.  Remember  the  fresh-water  rinse,  and  re- 
member a  good  tonic,  especially  one  with  oil 
in  it.  And  now  and  then  give  yourself  an  olive- 
oil  treatment.  Part  the  hair  every  inch  or  so, 
and  with  absorbent  cotton  rub  the  oil  lightly 
into  the  scalp.  Leave  on  over  night  if  possible. 
If  you  want  to  make  this  treatment  more 
thorough,  dip  a  brush  in  olive  oil  and  brush 
well  into  the  hair  itself.  This  is  especially  ad- 
visable for  burned,  sun-dried  hair.  Follow 
with  a  thorough  shampoo. 

/"CHANGE  is  the  life-blood  of  Hollywood. 
^—'  Change  in  face,  change  in  coiffure,  in  per- 
sonality. Thelma  Todd,  formerly  a  sweet-faced 
schoolteacher,  today  one  of  the  most  ravishing 
beauties  in  Hollywood;  Frances  Dee,  school- 
girl, has  blossomed  into  a  charming  sophisti- 
cate; Gwili  Andre,  New  York  model,  about  to 
make  a  screen  appearance  with  benefit  of  Hol- 
lywood. Carole  Lombard  changes  her  hair  for 
every  picture;  Karen  Morley  does  the  same, 
sometimes  includes  the  color  also. 

I  THINK  this  magic  of  change  is  one  of  the 
most  inspiring  lessons  for  all  of  us  who 
aspire  to  loveliness,  attractiveness,  charm. 
Change  seems  to  be  the  trick.  It  is  the  fairy 
wand  by  which  new  worlds  are  opened  to  us. 
I  think  this  Hollywood  habit  of  continual 
change  is  the  answer  to  hundreds  of  our  readers 
who  are  not  quite  satisfied  with  their  lives.  So 
easy  to  say,  I  know,  but  a  trick  that  requires 
concentration,  resolve  and  definite  purpose  in 
mind.  But  try  change  in  small  ways,  knowing 
that  eventually  it  will  make  itself  felt  in  the 
larger  things.

Why  I  take  a  dainty 
odorless  Ivory  bath 
every  day" 


"A  daily  Ivory  bath  is  my  way 
of  keeping  dainty,"  says  Irene. 
"Ivory  is  so  pure  that  it  purifies 
my  skin  and  makes  it  feel  silky. 
No,  I'd  never  use  perfumed 
soaps.  They're  so  drying  —  and 
I  don't  think  it's  alluring  to 
smell  like  a  soap.  I  prefer  a 
dainty  odorless  Ivory  bath.  It 
is  so  much  more  refined." 


"MISS  AMERICA" 


Let's  take  Irene's  frank  advice 
to  heart.  Every  day  a  dainty 
odorless  Ivory  bath  so  that  we'll 
never  offend! 

Beauty  is  a  serious  business  to  Irene 
Ahlberg — 3  hours  of  physical  train- 
ing every  day,  9  hours'  sleep  every 
night,  plenty  of  milk  and  salads 
.  .  .  and  gentle  Ivory  baths  once  or 
twice  a  day.

STRANGERS  OF  THE  EVENING— 
Tiffany  Prod. 

HTl  IE  opening  scenes  will  make  you  shiver  and 
-1-  .shudder,  what  with  dead  bodies  cluttering 
up  the  place,  but  later  you  realize  you  are 
seeing  a  rip-roaring  comedy.  Exciting,  well- 
acted,  mysterious,  and  some  crisp  wisecracks, 
with  Miriam  Seegar  and  Theodore  Von  Eltz 
furnishing  heart  throbs  and  ZaSu  Pitts,  Eugene 
Pallette,  Lucien  Littlefield  and  Harold  W'ald- 
ridge  giving  full  measure  of  laughs. 

THE  CRY  OF  THE  WORLD— Interna- 
tional Film  Foundation 

A  GLORIFIED  newsreel,  vitally  interest- 
■**■  ing;  a  cleverly  assembled  pictorial  preach- 
ment against  war,  graphically  portraying  the 
tumultuous  years  since  1914.  It  is  stark  reality 
without  humor.  A  frank  plea  for  the  protec- 
tion of  humanity,  it  will  grip  you. 

THE  WORLD  AND  THE  FLESH— Par- 
amount 

T  ACKTNTG  the  force  and  punch  of  his  former 
•"pictures,  George  Bancroft  as  a  Russian  Red, 
with  a  hearty  laugh  and  a  windblown  bob,  gives 
a  mild  performance  in  a  mild  picture.  He  falls 
in  love  with  a  dancer  (a.  Russian  refugee)  and 
his  troubles  begin.  Miriam  Hopkins  struggles 
hard  with  a  role  completely  unsuited  to  her 
talents.  The  plot  wanders,  the  dialogue  is 
mediocre  and  the  entire  picture  weak. 

MAN  ABOUT  TOWN— Fox 

"CYEN  though  Warner  Baxter  has  the  ability 
■'—'of  investing  an  unimportant  role  with  heart- 
interest  and  plausibility,  you  can  pass  this  up. 
Karen  Morley  is  in  it,  too,  but  the  story  is  im- 
possible. 

THE  ARM  OF  THE  LAW— Monogram 

TF  you  like  mystery,  if  you  enjoy  seeing  a 
-•-modern  gold-digger  at  work  and  if  you  care 
for  snappy  dialogue,  you  can  find  them  all  in 
this.  Marceline  Day,  Lina  Basquette  and  Dor- 
othy Revier  are  lovely. 

ESCAPADE— Invincible 

rTr\VO  men  and  a  woman  in  a  triangle.  Sounds 
■*-  melodramatic,  but  it's  a  pleasant  surprise. 
Sophisticated  story  and  dialogue,  and  splendid 
cast  including  Anthony  Bushell,  Jameson 
Thomas  and  Sally  Blane. 

ROADHOUSE  MURDER— Radio  Pic- 
tures 

THERE  is  very  nice  and  very  sincere  acting 
done  by  young  Eric  Linden  and  Dorothy 
Jordan,  which  is  totally  wasted  on  one  of  the 
season's  silliest  plots  which  concerns  a  cub  re- 
porter who,  in  order  to  get  a  better  newspaper 
job,  leaves  evidence  to  make  it  appear  that  he 
did  a  murder  of  which  he  was  only  the  witness. 
Sounds  involved?  Uh-huh,  that's  just  what  it 
is.    And  stupid,  besides. 

STREET  OF  WOMEN— Warners 

ALAN  DINEHART  is  a  wealthy  idler,  re- 
deemed through  love  of  "the  other  woman." 
Kay  Francis  is  splendid  as  the  sacrificing  other 
woman.  But  it's  Roland  Young's  playing  that 
saves  the  story  from  depressing  gloominess. 

NIGHT  WORLD— Universal 

THIS  picture  starts  off  in  a  pretentious,  prom- 
ising fashion,  and  then  something  happens 
— even-thing  happens — without  rhyme  or  rea- 
son.   Lew  Aytes,  playing  a  disillusioned  youth, 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  July,  1932 


is  fast  headed  for  ruin,  when  Mae  Clarke 
crosses  his  path  and  attempts  his  reformation. 
It  is  too  bad  that  such  ability  is  not  given  a 
better  chance. 

THE  MAN  FROM  NEW  MEXICO— 
Monogram 

TOM  TYLER  takes  a  flock  of  cattle  rustlers 
for  a  ride  and  saves  a  blushing  wild  rose  and 
her  old  pappy  from  the  infamous  clutches  of  the 
dastardly  villain  who  practically  gurgles, 
"Ah-h-h- — me  proud  beauty,"  as  he  slithers 
toward  the  girl.    Then  came  the  yawn. 

GET  THAT  GIRL— Richard  Talmadge 
Prod. 

HPHE  plot  stirs  up  considerable  commotion 
*■  about  rescuing  a  girl  from  a  band  of  schem- 
ers, with  Richard  Talmadge  Tartaning  to  the 
rescue.  This  is  funny  without  meaning  to  be. 
Shirley  Grey  is  the  girl. 

THE  WYOMING  WHIRLWIND— Willis 
Kent  Prod. 

HpHERE  are  Indians  aplenty  in  this  horse 
*■  oprey  which  stars  Lane  Chandler.  The 
latter,  cast  as  a  romantic  bandit  with  the  highly 
original  name  of  Lone  Wolf,  eludes  his  exasper- 
ated pursuers  on  the  Wyoming  ranges. 

THE  RIDING  TORNADO— Columbia 

A  GROUP  of  old  favorites  scamper  through 
■**■  this  breezy  Western.  There  are  Wallace 
MacDonald,  Russell  Simpson,  Montagu  Love 
and  Wheeler  Oakman,  but  the  hero  is  the  fast- 
riding  Tim  McCoy  who  finds  the  cattle  thief 
and  thereby  gets  himself  a  permanent  job  as 
son-in-law  to  the  ranch  owner. 

BORDER  DEVILS— Supreme 

AS  sort  of  a  cowboy  Galahad  in  the  Mexi- 
can .  Badlands,  Harry  Carey  goes  about 
generally  righting  wrongs  that  do  not  concern 
him. 

SINISTER  HANDS— Willis  Kent  Prod. 

p\EBONAIR  Jack  Mulhall  is  not  as  sprightly 
■*-^as  usual  in  this  mystery  melodrama.  Three 
pretty  girls  make  you  think  a  romance  is  in 
the  offing,  but  there  is  none  forthcoming,  and 
not  enough  mystery  to  get  you  excited. 

TRAPEZE— Harmonie-Film 

A  NNA  STEN,  who  did  such  grand  work  with 
■*  *-Emil  Jannings  in  "Tempest,"  gives  an- 
other splendid  performance,  this  time  as  a 
trapeze  artist  in  a  story  of  circus  life.  English 
captions  help  those  who  do  not  know  German. 

LOVE'S  COMMAND— Tobis 

\K ANY  amusing  situations  arise  when  an 
■^-'-Italian  countess,  impersonating  her  brother 
at  a  Viennese  military  academy,  tries  to  avoid 
detection.  Both  the  marching  songs  and  the 
waltz  rhythms  are  excellent.  English  subtitles 
make  it  possible  to  follow  this  German  dia- 
logue story. 

HUDDLE— M-G-M 

"V\7HEN  the  end  of  this  college  story  finally 
vv  arrives  you  feel  as  if  you've  spent  four 
long  years  in  the  theater.  Yale  is  the  locale, 
and  the  football  hero  plays  the  game  in  spite  of 
an  appendix  that  is  on  the  verge  of  bursting. 
Ramon  Novarro,  badly  miscast,  Madge  Evans 
and  talk  of  Yale's  traditions  don't  help.

An  interesting  picture  of  a  charm- 
ing woman,  educated,  well-to-do, 
prominent  in  the  social  and  civic 
life  of  her  city.  A  woman  typical 
of  the  many  to  whom  we  put  this 
question:  What  tooth  paste  do 
you  use? 

To  our  delight,  the  majority 
answered  Listerine  Tooth  Paste. 
Certainly  to  women  of  means,  the 
price  of  2S£  could  not  possibly 
have  been  a  factor  in  deciding 
upon  a  tooth  paste.  Obviously,  the 
quality  of  the  dentifrice  itself  and 


the  brilliant  results  it  accomplish- 
ed were  responsible  for  their  choice. 

Won't  you  try  Listerine  Tooth 
Paste?  See  how  thoroughly  it 
cleans.  How  swiftly  it  erases  blem- 
ishes and  discolorations.  How 
gleaming  white  it  leaves  the  teeth. 
How  it  refreshes  the  mouth  and 
sweetens  the  breath. 

Bear  in  mind,  incidentally,  that 
it  costs  you  but  half  of  what  you 
would  ordinarily  pay  for  tooth 
paste  of  equal  quality.  Lambert

"Give  us  more  pictures  with  George  Raft,"  the  fans  implore. 
And  no  wonder !  George  brought  a  fascinating  new  type  of  villain 
to  the  screen  in  "Dancers  in  the  Dark,"  with  Miriam  Hopkins 


MOVIE-GOERS  continue  to  like  their 
heroes  rough  and  ready.  The  chap  who 
topped  the  "question"  list  this  month 
is  George  Raft,  who  hails  from  Tent'  Avenoo 
and  Forty-foist  Street,  New  York  City. 
George  was  born  in  the  toughest  part  of  the 
town,  known  as  "Hell's  Kitchen."  He  is  5 
feet,  11  inches  tall,  weighs  160  pounds  and  has 
black  hair  and  brown  eyes. 

Folks  who  see  him  on  the  screen  as  the  bad, 
bold  villain  never  suspect  that  Georgie  once 
tripped  the  light  fantastic  in  one  of  New  York's 
dance  palaces  for  a  dime  a  spin.  For  several 
years  he  hoofed  with  Texas  Guinan's  Gang. 
He  was  a  good  hoofer,  too.  He  also  appeared 
on  the  stage  in  "City  Chap,"  "Gay  Paree," 
"  Manhatters,"  and  Ziegfeld's  "  Palm  Beach 
Nights."  A  European  tour  followed,  during 
which  he  met  the  Prince  of  Wales  and  taught 
him  the  Charleston. 

George's  screen  career,  which  began  in  April, 
1931,  boasts  of  such  pictures  as  "Quick  Mil- 
lions," "Hush  Money,"  "Palmy  Days," 
"Dancers  in  the  Dark,"  and  "Scarface."  He 
was  recently  given  a  long-term  contract  by 
Paramount. 

George  was  married  to  a  nurse  in  a  New 
York  dentist's  office.  She  once  gave  him  a 
bracelet  inscribed  "To  My  Gigolo." 

Jack  Long,  Oak  Grove,  Mo. — Bebe  Daniels 
is  spending  her  time  caring  for  little  Barbara 
Bebe.  Her  Warner  contract  still  calls  for  two 
more  pictures.  Bette  Davis  was  born  in 
Lowell,  Mass., on  April  5,  1908.  Her  real  name 
is  Ruth  Elizabeth  Davis,  but  when  she  started 
to  school  she  wanted  to  be  called  Betty.  When 
teacher  passed  out  the  enrollment  cards,  the 
young  miss  wrote  her  name  B-e-t-t-e  because 
she  thought  that  was  the  correct  way  to  spell 
Betty.  Her  parents  didn't  want  to  hurt  her 
feelings  so  they  let  the  spelling  stand. 

Jam-:  Robertson,  Oak  Park,  III, — Yes, 
Jane,  occasionally  doubles  are  used  in  pictures. 
That  is,  when  the  stunts  are  too  dangerous  for 
the  stars  to  do.  Alfredo  Codona,  the  famous 
circus  aeriahst,  did  the  aerial  tricks  for  Marion 
Davits  in"  Polly  of  the  Circus."  Gloria  Swan- 
son  did  her  own  warbling  in  "Tonight  or 
Never."  No  danger  in  that,  except  to  mascu- 
line hearts!  Gloria  was  born  on  March  27,  1898. 
She  is  5  feet,  one-half  inch  tall,  and  weighs  112.

Helen  Foster,  San  Rafael,  Calif. — 
Gloria  Swanson  and  Michael  Farmer  were  first 
wed  on  August  16,  1931,  in  New  York  State. 
This  marriage  wasn't  legal  in  California  be- 
cause Gloria  hadn't  received  her  final  decree  of 
divorce  from  the  Marquis.  However,  the 
decree  came  through  on  November  8,  and  the 
following  day  Gloria  and  Michael  went  to 
Yuma,  Ariz.,  and  had  the  knot  retied. 

Alice  Houston,  Houston-,  Tex. — Is  the 
town  named  after  you,  or  are  you  named  after 
the  town?  Jed  Prouty  is  a  native  of  Boston, 
Mass.  Sorry,  but  I  have  no  record  of  Mrs. 
Prouty's  maiden  name. 

Libby  of  Ephrata,  Pa. — Is  that  a  beverage 
or  a  new  kind  of  salad?  Here's  the  high-up  and 
low-down  on  Creis;bton  Chaney.  Creighton 
was  born  in  Oklahoma  City,  Okla.,  about  25 
years  ago.  He  is  6  feet,  2  inches  tall,  weighs 
205  pounds  and  has  dark  brown  hair  and  brown 
eyes.  The  lad  was  in  the  steam-fitting  business 
before  he  decided  to  forsake  his  tool-box  for  a 
make-up  box.  Radio  Pictures  put  him  under 
contract,  but  when  they  wanted  to  change  his 
name  to  Lon  Chaney,  Jr.,  he  refused,  saying 
that  he  didn't  want  to  cash  in  on  his  father's 
laurels.  But  everybody  on  the  lot  calls  him 
"Young  Chaney." 

A  Tobix  Fax,  Baltimore,  Md. — Your 
favorite,  Genevieve  Tobin,  was  born  in  New 
York  on  November  29,  1904.  She  is  5  feet,  3 
inches  tall,  weighs  109  pounds  and  has  blonde 
hair  and  gray  eyes.  She  appeared  on  the 
London  stage  in  "The  Trial  of  Mary  Dugan." 
Entered  pictures  in  July,  1930.  Genevieve  is 
still  fancy-free,  at  least  so  she  says.  Did  you 
read  that  story  about  her  in  the  June  issue  of 
Photoplay?  You're  not  a  Tobin  fan  if  you 
didn't. 

C.  Standen,  Pemrertox,  N.  J. — You're 
ri.i^h t,  as  always.  Judith  Wood  did  play  the 
role  of  June  in  "Working  Girls,"  and  Dorothy 
Hall  played  the  role  of  Mae.  I  always  get  the 
blondes  .nixed  up,  too. 

MoRT  P.,  Sax  Diego,  Calif. — That  arch- 
villain,  Rail'  Harolde,  was  born  in  Pittsburgh

Wigger.    He  is  5  feet,  10  inches  tall,  weighs  148 


pountls  and  has  dark  brown  hair  and  eyes.  W  is 
on  the  stage  for  twelve  years  before  he  started 
shooting  his  way  through  pictures.  He  is  a 
likeable  chap  off-screen,  although  on  the  screen 
he  gives  you  the  impression  that  he  wouldn't 
hesitate  at  anything. 

Babsee  Rayford,  Vallejo,  Calif. — 
Warner  Baxter  was  born  on  March  29,  1891. 
Will  you  still  admit,  Babsee,  that  you  went  to 
school  with  him?  Warner  has  been  married  to 
Winifred  Bryson  since  January  29,  1917.  They 
have  no  children. 

Isorel,  Victoria,  B.  C — Sylvia  Sidney  was 
born  in  New  York  City  on  August  8,  1910.  She 
is  5  feet,  4  inches  tall,  weighs  100  pounds  and 
has  dark  hair  and  blue-green  eyes.  Yes,  she's 
single.  She  appeared  on  the  stage  prior  to  her 
movie  debut.  Some  of  her  stage  shows  were 
"Crime,"  "Many  a  Slip,"  "The  Front  Page," 
and  "  Bad  Girl."  Her  latest  picture  is  "  Merrily 
We  Go  to  Hell,"  which  may  reach  the  screen 
under  another  name.  Sylvia's  mother  was 
Russian  and  her  father  Roumanian. 

Elaixe  From  Passaic,  N.  J. — The  four  im- 
portant players  in  the  picture  "Four  Devils" 
were  Janet  Gaynor,  Charles  Morton,  Nancy 
Drexel  and  Barry  Norton. 

Glexn  Wextzel,  Sioux  Fall?.  So.  Dak. — 
Maureen  O'Sullivan  was  born  in  Rascommon, 
Ireland,  on  May  17,  1911.  She  is  the  daughter 
of  Major  and  Mrs.  Charles  O'Sullivan  of 
Saintsbury,  Ire.  Is  5  feet,  4  inches  tall,  weighs 
114  and  has  dark  brown  hair  and  blue  eyes. 
Was  educated  in  the  Sacred  Heart  Academy  in 
Dublin.  Never  was  on  the  stage.  Enteied 
pictures  as  leading  lady  to  John  McCormack  in 
"  Song  O'  My  Heart."  Maureen's  next  picture 
will  be  "Strange  Interlude,"  with  Norma 
Shearer  and  Clark  Gable.  Still  single,  but  they 
say  Jimmie  Dunn  wants  to  change  all  that. 

Lilliax  Bliss,  Baltimore.  Md. — Lil,  I  was 
so  scared  when  you  threatened  me,  that  I 
shook  like  an  earthquake.  Leslie  Howard  has 
been  spending  his  time  on  the  New  York  stage 
appearing  in  "Animal  Kingdom."  This  play 
will  shortly  be  made  into  a  movie  with  Leslie 
and  Ann  Harding  in  the  leading  roles.  Sorry  I 
can't  give  out  home  addresses. 


Photoplay  Macazink  fob  July,  1932 


Virginia  Montgomery,  Akron,  Ohio. — I 
believe  I  have  given  Melvyn  Douglas'  history 
before,  but  here  it  is  again.  Melvyn  was  born

tall,  weighs  182  pounds  and  has  blond  hair  and 
blue  eyes.  Is  married  to  Helen  Gahagen,  well- 
known  stage  actress.  You  will  probably  see 
Helen  in  pictures  soon,  too.  Before  Melvyn 
i  went  to  Hollywood  he  played  on  the  stage  in 
"A  Free  Soul,"  "Command  to  Love,"  and

brown  eyes. 

Verne  Banarde,  Seattle,  Wash. — Verne, 
it  was  Ray  Milland  who  played  the  role  of 
Connie  Bennett's  wealthy  fiance  in  "Bought." 
He  also  played  the  role  of  the  exiled  king  in 
"Ambassador  Bill." 

Lucille  Peirce,  Hollvtwoodland,  Calif. 
— Thought  you  would  know  all  about  your 
favorite  because  he  has  been  in  pictures  a  long 
time.  Or  have  you  just  discovered  him?  Paul 
Lukas  was  born  in  Budapest,  Hungary,  on 
May  26,  1896.  He  stands  6  feet,  2  inches,

Evelyn  Braussard,  New  OrleAns,  La. — 
Norma  Shearer  played  in  both  "Let  Us  Be 
Gay"  and  "The  Divorcee."  In  the  former 
picture  Rod  LaRocque  appeared  with  her,  and 
in  the  latter  Chester  Morris. 

Dollie  Hagar,  Lawton,  Okla. — Dollie, 
your  favorite,  Peggy  Shannon,  began  her  screen 
career  by  appearing  in  Vitaphone  shorts,  early

Kay  Douglass,  San  Diego,  Calif. — Kay, 
of  the  two  actors  you  mentioned,  Kent 
Douglass  spells  his  name  the  same  as  yours, 
and  Melvyn  drops  one  "s"  from  the  last  name.

REVOLTING! 

the  job  of  washing 
dirty  handkerchiefs 


Why  do  it? 

use 
KLEENEX 

disposable    tissues 

and  destroy 

THE  worst  job  on  earth!  That's 
what  any  woman  says  about 
washing  dirty  handkerchiefs. 

Why  inflict  this  repulsive  job  on 
yourself,  or  on  anyone  else?  Use 
Kleenex,  as  so  many  other  people 
now  are  doing.  They  started  to  use 
thishealth  handkerchief  during  colds 
—then  found  it  impossible  ever  to 
return  to  the  old,  unsanitary  way. 

Kleenex  is  made  of  soft  rayon- 
cellulose  in  convenient  squares,  hand- 
kerchief size.These  disposable  tissues 
are  softer  than  any  handkerchief- 
downy,  dainty,  gentle,  absorbent. 

Costs  less  than  laundering 

If  you  have  been  sending  washing 
out,  you  will  find  Kleenex  a  great 
saving  over  laundry  bills.  You  can 
use  many  tissues  for  the  cost  of  laun- 
dering one  handkerchief.  And  think 
how  pleasant  to  use  each  tissue  only 
once— selecting  a  fresh,  clean  one 
every  time. 

Try  some  of  the  other  uses,  that 
Kleenex  fans  have  written  us  about! 
Kleenex  for  applying  ointments  and 
lotions. Kleenexforthebaby.Kleenex 
for  applying  cosmetics— and  for  re- 
moving them.  All  drug,  dry  goods 
and  department  stores  sell  Kleenex.

The  Nuttiest  Quartette  in  the  World 

[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  27  ] 


bewildered,  will  wrestle  for  his  life.  Without 
knowing  why.  Tug.  Pull.  Roll.  Toss.  The 
i  i-r.-ir  still  clenched  in  his  teeth.  Not  a  smile. 
Everything  very  serious. 

Suddenly,  Eiarpo  unwraps  himself  from  the 
wrestling  Lubitsch  and  off  he  trots.  Without 
a  word.  While  Hcrr  Luhitsch  stands  in 
stunned  amazement  at  what  has  just  happened. 
Looking  after  him.  Bewildered.  Still  unable 
t<>  believe  that  he  had  openly  participated  in  a 
u  rest  ling  match.    For  no  reason. 

LADY  interviewers,  no  matter  how  sedate, 
never  look  quite  the  same  after  a  Marx  inter- 
view. At  lunch  in  the  commissary  they'll 
wrap  their  legs  about  the  interviewer's  feet. 
Lay  their  ridiculous  heads  in  her  unsuspecting 
lap  or  decide,  as  a  whole,  that  what  she  really 
needs  is  a  good  chiropractic  treatment  and, 
before  the  entire  dining-room,  proceed  to  rub 
the  lady's  back  into  a  blister.  Limping  home 
with  bruised  ankles,  skinned  back,  torn  teddy 
straps,  the  lady  calmly  considers  the  whole 
thing,  sits  herself  down  on  the  nearest  curb 
and  laughs  herself  sick. 

It's  so  silly. 

They're  absolutely  unawed  byanyone.  They 
have  as  much  fun  with  a  carpenter  on  the  set 
as  with  the  Duke  of  Manchester  in  a  palace. 
And  this,  of  course,  to  a  snobbish  Hollywood, 
is  beyond  complete  understanding. 

A  high  and,  ah  me,  how  important  executive, 
immaculate  in  blue  coat  and  white  flannels, 
came  across  the  lot  the  other  day.  Mere 
writers  and  directors  stepped  reverently  out 
of  the  way. 

Then  out  from  their  dressing-room  stepped 
the  Marxes.  Suddenly,  as  one,  they  spied  the 
executive.  And  with  no  word  spoken  they 
were  at  it.  They  unbuttoned  his  coat.  Tugged 
at  his  belt.  Loosened  his  tie.  And  with  both 
hands  clutching  his  fast  slipping  trousers,  the 
executive  ran  for  shelter.  While  three  news- 
paper reporters  lay  yowling 
and  kicking  in  hysterical 
mirth,  on  the  grass. 

Groucho  it  was  who,  in 
New  York,  approached 
Adolph  Zukor,  president  of 
Paramount  Pictures,  and  very 
politely  offered  him  the  use  of 
the  upper  berth  in  Groucho's 
drawing-room. 

"Of  course,-'  he  explained, 
"you'll  be  in  the  way  a  bit 
and  no  end  of  a  nuisance  but 
it  will  save  you  a  little  money 
and  give  you  a  place  to  sleep." 


•"TO  this  day  Zukor  still 
*■  wonders. 

They  are  the  least  socially 
ambitious  people  imaginable. 

They  are  invited  to  many 
swanky  parties  of  the  New 
York  400.  If  they  are  sure  of 
an  amusing  time,  they  go.  If 
not,  regardless  of  Mrs.  Astor- 
bilt's  pearl  necklace,  they  stay 
at  home.     And  play  poker. 

"lis  said  Groucho  (Julius\ 
the  wall-eyed  professor  with 
the  comic  mustache,  has  the 
quickest,  keenest  wit  of  any 
man  irj  America.  It  works 
with  a  lightning-like  speed 
that  leaves  one  breathless. 
He's  two  sentences  ahead  of 
anyone.  The  complete  joke 
is  uttered  before  one  ever  gets 
half  way  to  it. 

Little  as  it's  suspected, 
Groucho  Marx   is  shy.     He 

90 


developed  his  rapid  delivery  so  that  if  one 
joke  died  a  quick  and  horrible  death,  he'd  have 
another  ready  to  fill  in.  He'll  omit  old  jokes 
in  a  show  and  substitute  new  ones  in  a  flash. 
There  is  no  half-way  station  about  Groucho. 
He's  either  extremely  serious,  grave  or  de- 
pressed, or  extremely  mad. 

A  friend  will  call  on  Groucho  one  night  and 
find  him  dancing  up  and  down  stairs  on  his 
hands,  and  the  next  night  deeply  concerned 
over  a  coal  miner's  fate  in  England  or  a 
Chinaman's  fate  in  burning  Shanghai. 

He's  a  father  with  a  mother's  fierce,  maternal 
love.  Groucho  adores  his  Stephen,  aged  eleven, 
and  his  Marion,  just  four.  At  gay,  hilarious 
beach  parties  at  Malibu,  you'll  find  Groucho 
with  Stephen,  yards  up  the  beach  hunting 
shells  by  themselves.  In  the  slush  and  thaw 
of  a  spring  at  Great  Neck,  New  York,  they'll 
come  traipsing  in  from  a  two-handed  ball 
game,  both  caked  and  drenched  with  slush  and 
mud.  But  happy.  "Don't  put  Marion  to  bed 
for  another  fifteen  minutes,"  I've  heard  him 
phone  from  the  set.  And  a  bit  later,  "Mama, 
we  were  held  up  again,  couldn't  she  stay  up  a 
little  longer?     I  want  to  say  goodnight. " 

Apart  from  Stephen,  from  mama,  from 
Marion,  is  the  other  Groucho  who  recently 
gave  a  birthday  party  to  his  dad  and  placed  a 
pistol  beside  each  of  his  brother's  places  and 
came  in  wearing  a  gun  and  holster.  All  pre- 
pared for  a  family  fight! 

Chico  (Leo)  who  performs  on  a  piano  as  no 
self-respecting  piano  was  ever  performed  on 
before,  is  the  oldest,  and  business  manager. 
He  it  is  who  negotiates  contracts  and  walks 
out  on  twelve-thousand-dollar-a-week  offers 
with  the  nonchalance  of  a  man  turning  down 
two  dollars  a  month.  His  little  daughter, 
Maxine,  adores  her  daddy,  laughs  at  all  his 
jokes,  and  thinks  he's  much  funnier  than  her 
uncles. 

"On  the  set  at  nine,  Chico,"  the  director 


'Don't  forget,  Margie,  we  have  a  date  tonight" 


said  recently.  "Oh,  I  can't,"  Chico  replied. 
"Why  not?"  the  surprised  director  asked. 
"Oh,  I'll  be  oversleeping  tomorrow,"  he 
shrugged  and  strolled  off. 

If  one  is  late  on  the  set,  the  others  rag  him 
unmercifully. 

They  criticise  one  another's  work  while  the 
director  looks  helplessly  on.  "More  action 
here,  Chico,"  Groucho  will  say.  "More  pep.'' 
And  Chico  does  it  again.    With  more  pep. 

Harpo  (Arthur),  the  dumb  one  with  the 
floor-mop  wig,  inherited  the  love  of  the  harp  in 
grandpa's  covered  wagon.  Harpo,  with  his 
utter  simplicity  and  lack  of  pretense,  is  the 
pet  of  the  New  York  intelligentsia.  A  close 
friend  of  Alexander  Woollcott.  A  man  whom 
even  Bernard  Shaw  traveled  to  see  in  London. 
And  laughed  uproariously  when  Harpo  sprang 
out  of  his  swimming  pool,  to  greet  him,  en- 
tirely in  the  nude.  The  only  bachelor,  he 
lives  at  the  beach  with  a  cook  and  man  servant. 
Thrust  by  his  mother  onto  a  stage  in  an  ill- 
fitting  yachting  suit  and  exactly  two  and  one 
half  minutes  notice,  with  nothing  to  say,  so  he 
said  it.  And  has  remained  dumb  ever  since. 
And  spends  most  of  his  time,  on  and  off  the 
screen,  chasing  blondes. 

Harpo  is  anauthorityon  bridge,  backgammon 
and  badminton.    He  will  bet  on  anything. 

SO  well  does  a  certain  New  York  producer 
think  of  Harpo's  talent,  he  recently  offered 
him  a  serious  play  of  a  Theater  Guild  quality, 
that  even  John  Barrymore  would  have  leaped 
at.    Instead,  Harpo  went  swimming. 

He  may  look  dumb,  and  act  dumb.  But 
you  ask  someone  sometime. 

Zeppo  (Herbert),  the  good-looking  youngest 
one,  is  the  least  understood.  Next  to  Harpo. 
Forced  by  necessity  of  plot,  to  be  just  a  hand- 
some juvenile,  few  know  that  Zeppo  has,  next 
to  Groucho,  the  keenest,  quickest  wit  of  any 
ten  thousand  men. 

Young,  handsome,  married, 
Zeppo  it  is  who  goes  in  for 
swankiness.  Rolls-Royces 
and  town  houses.  While  the 
others  live  in  extreme 
modesty.  He  plays  the  piano, 
the  saxophone  and  a  swell 
game  of  bridge. 

Many  a  radio  contract  as  a 
"crooner"  has  young  Zeppo 
Marx  turned  down.  His  voice 
is  astonishing. 

And  it's  noticeable,  too, 
that  at  a  gathering  it's  Zeppo 
at  whom  they  laugh  most 
His  quick  \Vit  surprising  those 
who  expect  this  Zeppo  to  be 
as  unfunny  off  the  screen  as 
on. 


•"THEIR  father,  seventy 
-*-  years  old,  who  looks  fifty 
and  acts  thirty,  calls  them  all 
"darling."  He'll  visit  his  dar- 
lings on  the  set. 

In  snappy  spats.  Cane. 
Boutonniere. 

The  boys  call  him 
"Frenchy."  Occasionally  the 
boys  would  take  Frenchy  with 
them  to  view  the  day's  rushes. 
But  Frenchy  immediately 
went  into  such  hysterics  at  his 
darlings'  antics,  that  one  of 
the  darlings  had  to  lead  him 
out.  So  he  doesn't  go  any 
more. 

On  the  last  trip  out  to  Cali- 
fornia, the  engineer,  conduc- 
tor and  numerous  passengers 


! 


alighted  from  the  train,  complete  nervous 
wrecks.  With  Harry  Ruby,  who  writes  shows, 
and  insists  upon  wearing  a  baseball  cap  and 
playing  ball,  they  alighted  at  every  station 
and  immediately  began  playing  ball.  The  en- 
gineer would  whistle,  their  wives  would  plead, 
the  conductor  would  beg,  and  still  they  played. 
Running  bases.  Striking  out.  Until  the  train 
finally  pulled  out.  Then  it  was  a  chase  and  a 
scramble  to  get  on.  At  Albuquerque,  the  word 
of  the  four  Marxes'  arrival  had  gone  ahead. 
Even  Indians,  by  the  hundreds,  had  gathered. 
Chico  stood  on  the  back  platform  and  made 
the  address.  In  broken  Italian.  While  old 
Indian  squaws  looked  at  Indian  chiefs,  in 
puzzlement. 

Zeppo  accidentally  dropped  a  glove  and 
there  was  an  immediate  scramble  for  it,  so  he 
tossed  off  the  other  one  as  the  train  pulled  out. 
Immediately,  Chico  seized  the  bell  cord, 
stopped  the  train,  ran  back  to  his  berth, 
grabbed  out  a  suitcase,  scattered  pajamas, 
socks,  handkerchiefs  until  he  found  what  he 
wanted.  Then  back  through  the  coaches  he 
tore  and  with  a  flourish  threw  out  his  gloves. 

A  WEALTHY  young  friend  on  the  train  had 
■*»■  arranged  for  his  plane  to  meet  him  at 
Indio,  Calif.,  and  he  invited  the  four  Marxes 
to  fly  on  to  Hollywood  with  him. 

The  studio,  all  dressed  up  and  ready  to 
meet  the  train  at  four  o'clock,  received  their 
first  wire  at  one-thirty.  "The  Marx  Brothers 
arrive  at  four  p.m."  At  two  o'clock  came, 
"The  Marx  Brothers  will  arrive  by  plane." 
At  two-thirty,  "The  Marx  Brothers  will  arrive 
by  train."  At  three  o'clock,  "The  Marx 
Brothers  won't  arrive  by  train."  And  at 
three-fifteen,  "I  doubt  if  the  Marx  Brothers 
ever  arrive." 

Deciding  to  accept  the  friend's  generous 
offer  to  go  by  plane,  they  left  the  train  at 
Indio. 

Then  it  was  found  the  combined  weight  of 
the  Marxes  with  the  plane  owner  and  the  pilot 
was  too  much  for  the  plane.  So  without  a 
moment's  hesitation,  the  Marxes  calmly  re- 
moved the  owner  of  the  plane  and  waving 
farewell  to  an  astonished  friend  on  a  large  and 
sandy  desert,  they  flew  away. 

Halfway  there,  they  discovered  they  had 
forgotten  to  eat  lunch,  so  forcing  the  pilot  to 
return  they  alighted  for  lunch  and  a  bit  of 
baseball. 

A  ND  after  the  train  had  arrived  in  Los 
-'^•Angeles  the  Marx  Brothers  flew  into  sight 
at  Clover  Field.  Exactly  two  hours  and  forty- 
five  minutes  behind  the  train. 

A  Marx  Brothers  conference  is  something 
that  defies  description.  Writers,  gag  men, 
Marxes,  supervisors,  director  and  producers 
assemble  themselves  to  discuss  the  story.  The 
supervisor  holds  the  script.  "Who  thought 
up  this  line?"  he  asks.  And  maybe  he  had 
never  heard  it  before  but  up  will  go  Groucho's 
hand.  "And  this  one?"  Up  goes  the  hand. 
"This  one?"  And  up  it  goes  until  long  after 
he's  through  asking  and  has  launched  into  a 
discourse,  Groucho's  hand  keeps  bobbing  up 
until  the  supervisor  looks  helplessly  around 
and  gives  up. 

Harpo,  who  carries  about  a  miniature  harp 
for  practice,  will  suddenly  pull  out  the  harp 
and  begin  to  practice.  Suddenly,  for  no  reason, 
Groucho  and  Chico  are  wrestling  about  on  the 
floor.  Zeppo,  as  referee,  hops  about.  Zipping 
off  a  writer's  shirttail  for  a  towel.  Harpo 
plays  on. 

Now  the  boys  are  out  of  their  corners  and 
at  it  again.  The  supervisor  sits  in  a  corner, 
wiping  huge  beads  of  perspiration  from  his  brow. 
He  glances  around  wildly.     Harpo  plays  on. 

"Now  here,  fellows,"  a  writer  screams  above 
the  din,  "let's  get  this  straight.  We've  got  all 
the  entrances  fixed  but  what  about  the  exits?" 

"Oh,  exits?"  the  four  Marxes  yell  and  grab- 
bing up  harps  and  themselves  from  the  floor, 
they  dash  for  the  door.  "Well,"  they  say, 
"speaking  of  exits." 

And  the  four,  mad  Marx  Brothers  exit.

BfAUTY  TfST 


proves  that  Woodbury's  brings  love- 
liness   to    the    most    sensitive    skin! 

Of  612  women  entering  a  Beauty  Clinic, 
many  thought  their  complexions  too  sen- 
sitive for  soap. 

In  the  Clinic,  each  of  these  women  cared 
for  one  side  of  her  face  with  creams  alone 
.  .  .  but  the  other  side  she  washed  every 
day  with  Woodbury's  Facial  Soap. 
In  a  week,  that  "sensitiveness"  disap- 
peared on  the  W  oodbury  side.  In  30  days, 
the  Woodbury  cheeks  were  smoother, 
firmer,  clearer,  brighter. 
If  you  think  you  can't  use  soap  on  your 
skin,  make  this  "Half-face  Test."  Keep  on 
coddling  one  cheek.  Wash  the  other  cheek 
daily  with  Woodbury's.  In  a  month,  the 
Woodbury  side  will  lose  that  sensitive- 
ness, that  dull,  flabby  droop. 
Your  skin  needs  creams,  too.  But,  first  of 
all,  it  needs  zestful  cleansing  with  Wood- 
bury's Facial  Soap.  Woodbury's  keeps  the 
skin  new  looking,  transparently  clear,  color- 
ful, and  firm.  And,  by  keeping  pores  free 
of  impurities,  Woodbury's  improves  skin 
texture. 

Woodbury's  is  much  more  than  an  ordi- 
nary toilet  soap.  It  is  a  scientific  beauty 
treatment  in  cake  form.  Begin  today  to 
use  it  on  YOUR  skin.  At  drug  stores  and 
toilet  goods  counters  everywhere. 

Facts    about    nation-wide  "Half-face    Test"

Cal  York's  Monthly  Broadcast  from  Hollywood 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  39] 


A  DIRECTOR  was  watching 
■*^  scenes  of  a  certain  famous  star 

and  we'll  bet  you  can  guess  who. 

"Just  look  at  her,"  he  mused, 
"working  herself  up  to  a  great  state 
of  calm." 

"COR  months,  PHOTOPLAY  has  ignored  rumors 
that  Douglas  Fairbanks,  [r.f  and  Joan  Craw- 
ford arc  not  altogether  happy.  We  felt  that 
those  kids  would  patch  up  whatever  difficul- 
ties they  were  in.  And  maybe  they  will  yet. 
On  another  page  of  this  magazine  there's  an 
amazing  story  about  the  Crawford  girl.  You'll 
know  her  a  lot  better  when  you  read  It. 

"T  IKE  father,  like  son,"  a  traffic 
'^"'cop  remarked  the  other  day  as 
he  handed  Doug  Fairbanks',  Jr.,  a 
ticket. 

"How's  that?"  Doug  asked. 

"Well,  it's  not  so  long  ago  I 
handed  your  father  one,"  the  cop  re- 
plied, "only  he  was  going  faster  than 
you,  son." 

JOHNNY    WEISSMULLER'S    New    York 

J  visit  is  the  main  topic  of  Broadway  conversa- 
tion. Johnny  appeared  everywhere — from 
smart  Park  Avenue  to  the  lower  East  Side — 
hatless  and  coatless,  and  often  he  wore  one  of 
the  famous  Clark  Gable  turtle-neck  sweaters. 


And  that  sort  of  thing  just  isn't  done  in 
York — except  by  a  Weissmuller,  who  can  get 
away  with  anything.  His  visits  to  the  M  CM 
were  Roman  holidays  and  not  once  did 
he  walk  properly  to  fhe  swinging  gate  and  have 
himself  announced.  No  sir.  he  just  jumped 
over  the  railing  with  that  wild  Tarzan  cry  and 
everybody  knew  he  had  arrived. 

/""NNCE  when  he  was  doing  his  swimming 
^^stunts  in  a  theater  tank  his  act  seemed  to 
be  unusually  long,  for  even  after  the  master  of 
ceremonies  had  run  out  of  dialogue — which  it 
takes  a  long  time  for  a  master  of  ceremonies  to 
do — Johnny  was  still  kicking  away  in  the  water. 

A  friend  of  his  asked  him  later  why  he  did  it. 
"  You  dragged  it  out  too  long.  Everybody 
was  bored,"  the  friend  complained. 

Johnny  hung  his  head,  ''Gee,  I'm  sorry. 
You  see,  I  was  just  taking  my  workout." 

TJT.'S  a  simple,  unassuming  lad — this  boy 
about  whom  all  the  girls  are  raving.  He 
attended  a  theatrical  performance  where 
celebrities  were  being  introduced  from  among 
the  audience.  By  some  oversight  Johnny 
wasn't  called  for.  And  he  was  the  only  one 
who  did  not  notice  the  slight,  but  sat  there  ap- 
plauding wildly  for  each  celeb.  And  Johnny 
was  the  most  important  among  them. 

He  is  still  just  a  swimmer  and  can't  realize 
that  he  is  a  star! 


X-IERE'S  how   Mrs.    Chico   Marx 
explains  her  famous  husband's 
accident  that  sent  him  to  the  hospital 
for  several  weeks. 

"You  see,  it  was  this  way.  Chico 
was  driving  along,  looking  in  shop 
windows  and  driving  through  stop 
signals  and  just  tending  to  his  own 
business,  when  another  man  drove 
right  into  his  car.     Imagine." 

XTANCY  CARROLL  was  off  salary  for  three 
weeks  while  she  made  up  her  mind  whether 
to  continue  at  the  old  figure — and  Nancy's 
figure  is  pretty  good  any  way  you  take  it — or 
sever  relationships.  And  Gary  Cooper  didn't 
want  to  play  opposite  Tallulah  Bankhead 
because  he  thought  the  role  didn't  suit  him. 

rPHE.\  came  rumors  that  Joan  Blondell  was 
kicking  over  a  few  traces  and  demanding 
more  money.  It  wasn't  money  but  rest  that 
Joan  wanted.  She  made  fifteen  pictures  during 
her  first  year  in  Hollywood  and  she  fears  a 
nervous  breakdown  (remember  that  poor  Mae 
Clarke  is  still  in  the  hospital)  unless  she  has  a 
breathing  spell  between  assignments.  She's 
going  to  get  it,  too. 

T\  7E'RE  not  through  with  the  rebels  yet. 
Marian  Marsh  and  Evalyn  Knapp  have 
severed  studio  connections.

How  can  you  say  this  new  Johnny  Weissmulle 
has  more  sex  appeal  than  Clark  Gable? 


Photoplay  Magazine  fob  July,  1932 


When  Marian  was  chosen  for  the  role  of 
Trilby  in  "Svengali,''  everybody  said  she  was 
swell  and  she  was  made  a  star  at  once.  Hut 
stars — real  ones — aren't  made  that  way.  The 
studio  saw  its  mistake,  took  away  her  star 
billing  and  began  to  build  her  up  in  small  roles. 
but  every  time  she  was  offered  one  of  the 
smaller  parts,  she  claimed  that  she  was  ill  and 
couldn't  take  it.  So  she  asked  for  her  release 
and  got  it. 

Evalyn    Knapp    wasn't    satisfied    with   her 
,  parts,  either,  so  she  quit.

"DUT  in  all  this  mad  mix-up — yc 
■^what  a  state  Hollywood  is  in — *l 


rou  can  see 
there  is  one 
old  stand-by,  one  ray  of  hope. 

Dick  Barthelmess  made  the  most  startling 
gesture  of  all  when  he  walked  into  the  boss' 
'office  and  said,  voluntarily  and  without  the 
subject  being  mentioned  to  him,  'T'm  ready 
to  take  a  cut.  I'll  do  three  pictures  for  the 
price  of  two. " 

And  that  was  just  after  his  starring  picture, 
"Alias  the  Doctor,  "  cleaned  up  at  the  box-office. 

Of  course,  high-powered  smelling  salts  were 
brought  for  Dick's  boss,  who  may  have  recov- 
ered by  the  time  you  read  this. 

Here's  Dick's  reason  for  his  amazing  state- 
ment. He  knows  world  conditions  and  he  says 
he'd  rather  work  for  less  than  to  find  him- 
self minus  a  job  later. 

Dick  is  a  rich  man  and  he  happens  to  like 
pictures. 

/~\NE  OF  PHOTOPLAY'S  readers 
^"^who  is  a  lot  smarter  than  your 
friend  Cal  wrote  in  to  tell  us  about  an 
amazing  inaccuracy  in  "Arsene  Lu- 
pin." 

We  saw  that  picture  and  thought 
it  was  swell,  but  what  we  didn't 
know  is  that  the  Mona  Lisa  could 
never  have  been  stolen  by  being 
rolled  and  put  into  an  umbrella,  as  it 
was  in  the  picture,  for  the  very 
simple  reason  that  the  Mona  Lisa  is 
painted  on  wood! 

Shame,  shame,  research  depart- 
ment! 

Y\  7HEX  Sally  Eilers  was  in  New  York  she 
was  mad  that  bad  old  newspaper  people 
kept  asking  her  if  the  squabble  that  she  and 
Hoot  had  before  she  arrived — which  Photo- 
play reported  last  month — would  mean  a 
separation. 

Sally  even  denied  the  squabble  and  told 
lovely  stories  about  how  proud  Hoot  was  of 
iher  and  her  new  success. 

Then  she  returned  to  Hollywood  and  the 
blow-up  came.  There's  probably  a  lot  to  be 
said  for  both  sides. 

While  Sally,  recovering  from  a  slight  auto- 
mobile accident,  stayed  at  Bebe  Daniels'  house, 
friends  tried  to  patch  everything  up,  but  re- 
peated conferences  between  Sally  and  Hoot 
have  left  them  both  at  an  impasse,  so  far. 

TF  you  happen  to  drop  into  the  Beverly  Hills 
Brown  Derby  restaurant,  you'll  see — almost 
any  lunch  hour — as  sweet  a  sight  as  there  is  in 
Hollywood— Mr.  and  Mrs.  Clark  Gable  being 
ultra  lovey-dovey  and  trying  to  pretend  that 
not  even  the  smallest  cloud  had  ever  marred 
jthe  blue  sky  of  their  marital  bliss. 

When  Mrs.  Clark  went  to  Xew  York  there 
were  no  definite  plans  for  her  return  and  there 
jhad  been  serious  discussions  with  lawyers.  But 
that's  all  over  for  the  time  being  and  every- 
thing is,  as  we  used  to  say  in  the  gay  nineties, 
hotsy-totsy.

The  above  photograph 
of  Estelle  Taylor,  taken 
on  December  30, 1926, 
reveals  a  lovely  young 
woman.  But  the  girl 
above  can  t  compare 
with  the  magnetic  Miss 
Taylor  of  today-,  whose 
alluring  beauty  has  a 
haunting   quality. 


And  why?  It's  not  only  because  she  takes 
care  of  her  appearance,  but  because  she 
knows  how  to.  She  has  carefully  analyzed 
in  just  what  way  cosmetics  enhance  and 
accent  her  beauty.  And  she  insists  on  those 
cosmetics  that  she  has  found  most  suc- 
cessful in  bringing  out  her  loveliness. 
She  knows,  for  instance,  the  real  reason 
for  using  powder.  It  is  to  give  a  smooth 
even  finish  to  the  skin,  without  hiding 


the  beautiful  transparent  texture  of  the 
natural  flesh.  Hours  of  grooming,  of  keep- 
ing the  skin  clean  and  soft  and  healthy, 
are  wasted  if  the  skin  texture  is  coated 
with  a  thick  dull  mask. 

Pompeian  has  met  all  the  tests  of  a  per- 
fect powder.  It  does  not  coat  the  skin.  It 
clings  for  hours.  It  gives  a  soft  fine-textured 
finish.  It  is  developed  in  tones  that  en- 
hance the  natural  colorings.  Flesh  for  the 
very  light  skin,  Naturelle  (nude)  for  the 
blonde  with  a  fair  complexion,  Rachel 
for  the  brunette  with  a  fair  skin.  Peach 
for  the  blonde  with  a  warm  skin  tone, 
and  Dark  Rachel,  a  warm  rich  tone  for 
the  brunette  with  a  dark  skin.  You'll 
love  the  delicious  fragrance  and  the  smart 
convenient  box.  Pay  more  for  your  face 
powder  if  you  will,  but  you  can't  pur- 
chase better  powder  than  Pompeian.  The 
Pompeian  Creams,  Lipsticks  and  Rouges 
are  equally  high  in  quality  and  low  in  price.

rT*'IIE  divorce  proceedings  between  Lowell 
Sherman  and  Helene  Costello,  sister  of 
Dolores  Costello  (Mrs.  John  Barrymore), 
threatened  to  be  sensational,  but  after  a  little 
family  linen  was  washed  in  the  open  court,  the 
attorneys  got  together  and  decided  that  it 
wouldn't  do  anybody  any  good  to  continue  and 
it  was  brought  to  a  more  or  less  peaceful  con- 
clusion. For  some  years,  Dolores  and  Helene 
saw  very  little  of  each  other  or  of  their  famous 
dad,  Maurice  Costello,  the  veteran  idol  of  the  old 
Yitagraph  days. 

Their  husbands  were  not  at  all  friendly,  but 
now  that  Helene  is  separated  from  Lowell  the 
girls  are  inseparable. 

TT  happened  in  a  Hollywood  beauty  shop. 

Said  a  masculine  voice  from  one  of  the 
booths,  "  You  must  attain  a  certain  hardness, 
a  boldness. " 

And  while  the  customers  wondered  at  this 
strange  beauty  doctrine,  a  hairdresser  parted 
the  curtains  to  discover  Joan  Crawford  and 
director  Lewis  Milestone  deep  in  a  discussion 
about  Joan's  part  of  Sadie  Thompson  in  "Rain." 


TT  was  not  much  of  a  surprise  that  the  comedy 
partnership    of    Bert    Wheeler    and    Robert 
Woolsey  went  on  the  rocks. 

Bert  felt  that  Robert  was  getting  the  besl  of 
a  deal  the  pair  were  making  for  a  Columbia 
picture  and  expressed  his  resentment  by  taking 
a  train  East.  He  and  Dorothy  Lee.  the  Hip 
little  girl  who  played  in  many  of  the  Wheeler- 
Woolsey  pictures,  will  try  to  knock  'em  dead  in 
personal  appearances. 

C^ON'STAXCE  BEXXETT  is  being  little 
^^Goody  Two-Shoes  these  days  and  the  boys 
from  the  M-G-M,  Pathe  and  First  Xational 
publicity  departments  listen  in  pop-eyed  won- 
der while  the  Radio  Pictures  press  agents  tell 
how  Connie  is  as  pleasant  as  an  insurance 
agent  and  will  go  to  any  trouble  to  pose  for 
publicity  stills.  If  you  remember  the  Connie 
of  the  days  before  this  startling  metamorphosis 
came  about  you'll  realize  just  how  Our  Lady 
of  Distinction  has  changed. 

There's  a  pretty  cute  reason  for  it,  too. 
Seems  that  the  big  bosses  of  Radio  Pictures 
decided  that  temperament  was  too  expensi%-e 
and  they  did  a  little  law  laying-down  for 
Connie's  benefit.  -The  gist  of  it  was  that 
Connie  would  do  what  she  was  told — or 
Connie  decided  that  it  wouldn't  be  "or  else."

seeing  each  other  every  day.  "  She  adds,  wisely, 
that  she  wouldn't  advise  this  arrangement  for 
all  married  folks  but  that  it  works  for  her  and 
Norman.  So  Norm  lives  in  one  house  and 
Claudette  and  her  mother  in  another,  just  as 
they  have  been  doing  ever  since  their  marriage 
several  years  ago.

Here  is  the  very  first  picture  ever 
snapped  of  Michele  Bridget  Farmer. 
And  does  she  look  like  her  mama  or 
her  papa?  Gloria  Swanson  didn't 
want  to  have  her  baby  daughter's 
picture  taken,  so  the  photographer 
just  clicked  his  camera  and  ran.  Hol- 
lywood is  anxiously  waiting  for  a  look 
at  the  baby,  but  Gloria  and  the  proud 
father,  Michael  Farmer,  are  still  in 
London,  where  Michele  was  born  and 
where  Gloria  plans  to  make  a  picture 


T\7HEX  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Clyde  C.  Burgert,  of 
Kansas  City,  Missouri,  built  themselves 
a  modest  home  and  garage  there  was  one  thing 
lacking — a  car.  Because  of  the  expense  of  rear- 
ing their  three  children  they  felt  it  would  be  an 
unwise  investment.  But  on  the  night  of  April 
30  a  brand  new  Rockne  Coupe  was  driven  up  to 
their  home  and  formally  presented  to  the  de- 
lighted couple.  Lotti  Loder,  of  Fred  Stone's 
"Smiling  Faces"  company,  playing  a  local 
theater,  made  the  presentation. 

Here  is  the  secret:  Mrs.  Burgert  had  sub- 
mitted an  entry  in  Photoplay  Magazine's 
weekly  radio  prize  contest  and  she  had  won  the 
automobile  as  first  prize  for  the  night  of  April 
16. 

Now  if  the  Burgert  garage  is  vacant  it  is  only 
because  the  family  is  running  up  a  lot  of  mile- 
age. 

H^  RUST  Tallulah  Bankhead  to  solve 
that  dentist  problem. 
When  she  knows  she  has  to  spend 
an  hour  with  a  molar  expert  she  takes 
her  portable  gramophone — as  Talloo 
calls  it — with  her  and  her  maid 
changes  records  constantly  to  drown 
out  the  sound  of  the  grinding  drill. 

T\  7HTLE  stars  demand  more  money  and 
writers,  begging  for  a  two-minute  con- 
ference, cool  their  heels,  if  not  their  heads, 
outside  the  office  of  Irving  Thalberg,  there  is  a 
certain  lad  who  is  never  refused  admittance 
nor  required  to  wait  a  single  moment.  Young 
fellow,  he  is,  too — just  two  years  old. 

96 


I'll  bet  you've  guessed,  smarty!  Ycssir, 
little  Irving  Jr.,  comes  to  the  studio  almost 
every  day  with  Mama  Norma  Shearer  just  to 
see  that  everything  is  hunky-dory  on  the 
M-G-M  lot.  And  he  is  the  friendliest  and  best 
liked  person  who  ever  visited  a  studio. 

V\  7TIKN  Richard  Dix  registered  at  the  Am- 
bassador  Hotel  incognito  and  alone, 
eighteen  reporters  besieged  him,  "Ah-ha,  so 
you've  separated  from  your  wife,"  they  ac- 
cused. 

Dix  explained  that  Winifred  was  in  San 
Francisco  visiting  her  parents. 

"O.K.  but  why  aren't  you  staying  at  your 
apartment  or  your  ranch  house?"  they  per- 
sisted. 

Rich  stammered  some  excuse.  He  didn't 
want  to  tell  them  the  reason,  for  he  was  afraid 
they'd  think  him  a  softy.  The  real  reason? 
Simply  this — that  the  sight  of  his  wife's  clothes 
and  little  personal  belongings  around  the  house 
made  him  so  lonesome  he  couldn't  stand  it,  so 
he  sneaked  away  to  a  hotel  room  where  there 
wouldn't  be  any  reminders  of  her.  And  she 
was  only  going  to  be  away  for  a  couple  of 
weeks!  From  where  I  sit,  I'd  diagnose  the 
trouble  as  a  case  of  real  love. 

A  T  one  million  bridge  parties,  teas  and  cock- 
tail  parties  women  are  asking  each  other, 
"Who  is  Ann  Harding  in  love  with?" 

And  if  that  lingering,  tearful  kiss  she  gave 
her  husband — ex-husband  he  was  then — im- 
mediately after  she  got  her  divorce  from  him  in 
Reno  is  any  indication,  the  answer  is — Harry 
Bannister.  You  simply  can't  convince  the 
Hollywood  folks  that  there  is  any  other  man  in 
Ann  Harding's  scheme  of  things. 


Once  "Hollywood's  happiest  woman,  "  she  is 
now  its  saddest  and  besides  that,  she's  a  pretty 
sick  girl.  Her  new  picture,  "Westward  Pas- 
sage, "  was  almost  entirely  re-made — with 
director  E.  H.  Griffith  at  the  megaphone.  You'll 
recall  that  there  were  long  and  bitter  quarrels 
between  Ann  and  Griffith  during  the  making 
of  "Holiday"  and  both  swore  that  they  would 
never  again  work  together. 

Immediately  after  the  new  version  was  fin- 
ished, Ann  hopped  off  to  Reno — and  the 
romance  between  her  and  Harry  was  finished 
by  a  judge. 

T  WONDER  if  Ann  saw  an  item  in  Louis 
Sobol's  column  which  told  of  the  opening  of 
Ann's  first  big  stage  success,  "The  Trial  of 
Mary  Dugan. "  Bannister,  himself  an  impor- 
tant stage  star,  stood  at  the  back  of  the  theater 
and  his  lips  moved  with  Ann's  as  she  read  her 
lines,  for  he  knew  every  word  of  her  part.  And 
when  the  curtain  fell  on  the  last  act,  Harry's 
friends  crowded  around  him  to  congratulate 
him  on  his  wife's  new-found  success. 

I  guess  you  don't  need  me  to  point  out  the 
irony  of  that  to  you! 

"DUT  while  Ann  was  fainting  on  the  set, 
Harry  was  putting  himself  into  fine  condi- 
tion in  Reno,  arising  at  seven-thirty,  taking 
regular  boxer's  road  work  with  Kid  Herman, 
training  in  the  gymnasium  and  going  to  bed 
at  nine.  He's  back  in  Hollywood  now,  wait- 
ing for  a  motion  picture  or  theatrical  offer. 

HTHE  Y  were  making  out-door  scenes  for  "Hell 
Divers"   in  San   Diego  and  over  half  the 
townsfolk  had  gathered  to  watch  Clark  Gable 
and  Wally  Beery  emote. 


Acme 


Just  a  bunch  of  the  folks  whooping  it  up  at  the  opening  of  "Grand  Hotel" 
in  Hollywood.  Do  you  recognize  two  sets  of  newlyweds — Mr.  and  Mrs. 
Gene  Markey  and  the  Marquis  and  Marquise  de  la  Falaise  ?  Sisters 
Joan  and  Connie  Bennett  are  often  seen  with  their  husbands  in  a  gay 
foursome  like  this.    And  note  Hank's  adoring  gaze,  as  he  looks  at  Connie 


Suddenly,  Wally  held  up  his  hand.  "Hey 
folks,  just  a  moment.  I  want  to  introduce  Mr. 
What-a-Man  Gable!" 

The  only  thing  that  saved  Beery's  life  was 
the  fact  that  he  is  bigger  and  stronger  than 
Gable. 

For  to  be  called  a  sheik  or  to  be  compared 
to  Rudolph  Valentino  is  what  makes  Clark 
mad. 

You  can  tell  him — and  right  to  his  face,  too 
— that  he  has  big  ears;  you  can  say  he  is  a 
rotten  actor — and  he  grins  and  bears  it. 

But  even  to  imply  that  he's  the  answer  to 
a  maiden's  prayer  makes  him  just  plain  sore! 

A  ND  that's  why  that  old  gag  puller  Beery 
•'Motes  on  doing  just  that.  Once,  on  the  set, 
t  Clark  was  surrounded  by  a  bunch  of  feminine 
extras. 

It  wasn't  his  fault.  Women  just  naturally 
1  gravitate  to  him. 

Suddenly,  through  the  loud  speakers,  boomed 
a  voice,  "Mrs.  Clark  Gable  on  the  telephone 
for  Mr.  Gable." 

She  wasn't  at  all.  Wally  Beery  had  simply 
paid  a  visit  to  the  sound  mixer  and  had  pulled 
the  stunt  just  to  show  the  girls  that  the  sheik 
was  already  shackled. 

Wally  isn't  the  only  one  who  kids  Clark  like 
this. 

Whenever  anyone  wants  to  get  the  Gable 
goat  that's  the  way  to  do  it. 

"CPLEGANT  noses  sniffed  as  the 
"^"'gusty  smell  of  liver  and  bacon 
and  onions  was  wafted  down  the 
corridors  of  dressing  room  row  on 
the  Radio  Pictures  lot.  Blood  hounds 
— and  a  couple  of  hungry  writers — 
were  put  on  the  scent  only  to  discover 
that  the  aroma  emanated  from  the 
luxurious  dressing  rooms  of  the 
equally  luxurious  Connie  Bennett. 
But  nobody  was  invited  in  for  lunch- 
eon. 

Connie  was  simply  having  one  of 
her  favorite  dishes. 

T  WOXDER  if  Elissa  Landi  realizes  how  many 

people  in  Hollywood  smile  when  her  name  is 
mentioned.  It's  because  they  consider  her  pet 
peeve — the  talk  about  her  royal  background — 
really  funny. 

You  see,  Elissa  had  considered  the  true  story 
that  she  is  the  granddaughter  of  the  late 
Empress  Elizabeth  of  Austria,  was  hers  to  tell 
when  she  wanted  to.  She  wasn't  ready  to  tell 
it  when  Photoplay  got  the  scoop  and  printed 
it. 

Was  she  burned? 
I     Shortly  afterwards,  another  publication  de- 
nied the  story. 

Folks  thought  Elissa's  blood  pressure 
couldn't  go  any  higher,  but  it  did. 

She  was  so  angry  at  having  her  royal  ancestry 
denied  that  she  fumed  for  days. 

Y\7HEN  Karen  Morley  was  working  in  "  In- 
spiration" no  one  could  have  been  nicer 
to  her  than  Garbo  was.  She  went  out  of  her 
way  to  help  the  little  newcomer  with  her  first 
picture  and  even  joked  with  her  on  the  set. 

But  every  thing  was  different  in  "  Mata  Hari." 
It  was  as  if  Garbo  and  Karen  had  never  met — 
50  aloof  was  the  great  star.  She  did  not  bother 
?ven  to  speak  to  her  except  once  when  Karen's 
micelet  would  not  clasp.  "Can't  you  fix  it?" 
Garbo  asked  and  then,  with  her  own  hands, 
snapped  it  together. 

And  what  caused  the  difference  only  Garbo 
knows.

When  Mary  Pickford  hurried  back  from  New  York  to  meet  Douglas  Fair- 
banks upon  his  return  from  the  South  Seas,  she  was  greeted  at  the  train 
by  'left)  scenario  writer  Frances  Marion  and  the  Countess  di  Frasso.  The 
Countess,  you  will  recall,  was  a  member  of  Gary  Cooper's  party  in  Africa 
and  is  now  going  to  all  the  very  smartest  Hollywood  parties  with  Gary 


TN  the  last  few  scenes  of  "  Strange  Interlude, " 
Norma  Shearer  and  Clark  Gable  play  the 
roles  of  very  old  people. 

Make-up  took  care  of  facial  characteristics, 
but  besides  looking  old,  Norma  and  Clark  had 
to  act  old. 

And  they  didn't  dare  get  out  of  character. 
Their  shoulders  drooped;  their  voices  were 
cracked. 

When  the  two  weeks  shooting  was  over  they 
both  bounded  off  the  set  like  a  couple  of  air- 
dales  let  loose  from  a  city  apartment.  Screaming 
and  shouting — they  lept  into  the  commissary 
and  ordered  round  after  round  of  drippy  ice 
cream  sodas. 

"Aw,  be  your  age!"  somebody  mumbled. 

"That's  exactly  what  we're  doing  for  a 
change,"  Norma  retorted. 

Y\  7HI.N  Gary  Cooper  arrived  in  Hollywood 
eyes  popped  like  champagne  bottles,  jaws 
fell  heavily  upon  chests. 

It  looked  like  Gary — a  very  well  fed,  healthy 
Gary — but  the  clothes!  Derby  hat,  English 
muffler,  Bond  Street  suits. 

And  perched  upon  his  shoulder  was  Toluca, 
a  full  grown  chimpanzee. 

And  then  the  Cooper  boy  began  looking  for 
a  home.  Apartment  house  landlords  took  a 
look  at  Toluca  and  explained  that  there  wasn't 
a  vacancy.  So  Gary  moved  to  the  Roosevelt 
Hotel.  But  he  soon  noticed  that  Toluca  seemed 
unhappy. 

And  Gary  decided  the  poor  chimp  was  lone- 
ly. He's  sent  for  another  little  monkey  to  keep 
Toluca  company.  And  how  he's  going  to  house 
that  family  nobody  knows.

When  I  say  "family"  that's  what  I  mean. 
Gary  plans  to  have  the  monks  fed  from  his 
own  table. 


T~HEsmartest  horseback  party  that's  ever  been 
given  in  Hollywood  was  Marion  Da  vies',  i 
It  was  a  thirty-five  mile  trek  with  a  stop  for 
luncheon  where  a  complete  picnic  equipment 
was  already  waiting  for  the  party.  The  food 
wagons  had  left  before  dawn. 

There  was  another  stop  for  afternoon  tea, 
already  prepared  in  the  same  manner  and  a 
hot  dinner  at  the  top  of  the  trail,  where  auto- 
mobiles were  waiting  to  take  the  party  back 
home. 

But  in  spite  of  all  this  dc  luxe  business  a  lot 
of  meals  were  eaten  off  a  lot  of  Beverly  H 
mantels  the  next  day. 

A^ANY  folks  have  wondered  why  Marian 
Marsh,  a  girl  of  eighteen,  has  been  able  to 
portray  emotions,  on  the  screen,  that  would  be 
difficult  for  women  much  older  and  with  much 
greater  experience.  The  answer  is  a  Strang* 
one. 

Marian  fell  in  love  with  a  man,  some  ye 
older  than  herself,  when  she  was  only  sixte 

She  wanted  to  marry  him,  but  her  fatJ 
asked  that  she  wait  awhile. 

Her  father  was  going  on  a  trip  to  New  Yortl 
and  told  her  he  would  discuss  her  future  witl| 
her  when  he  got  back. 

But  he  did  not  come  back — he  died  o 
pneumonia  in  New  York. 

Heartbroken — she  had  loved  her  father  ver  I 
much — she  turned  to  her  sweetheart  for  con  | 
solation. 

And  then,  a  strange  thing  happened.  H 
went  away  on  a  business  trip  and  the  next  won 
Marian  had  from  him  was  the  news  that  h 
was  married. 

So  maybe  that  explains  why  Marian  is  on 
actress  who  doesn't  need  the  glycerin  bcttl 
when  a  scene  calls  for  tears.

birds  of  Hollywood)  and  promptly  lost  it. 

One  evening  Wally  Beery  arrived  home  and 
found  the  pup  capering  about  the  lawn.  That 
night  he  heard  Buster  announce  over  the  radio 
that  there  would  be  a  twenty-five  dollar  re-

HOW 

your  Laxative 
works 


When  it  is  so  easy  to  get  a  laxative  that  is  safe, 
as  well  as  effective,  there  is  no  excuse  for  risk- 
ing health  with  the  wrong  kind.  The  wrong  kind 
is  a  serious  threat  to  your  health! 

So  before  you  take  any  laxative,  ask  this  one 
question:  "How  does  it  work?" 

Many  wrong  laxatives  employ  violence.  They 
leave  the  system  weakened.  They  disregard  the 
delicate  peristaltic  action  of  the  intestinal 
muscles. 

Gentle  help  is  what  you  need 

The  right  laxative  employs  Nature's  way. 
Gently  yet  effectively,  it  gets  results  without 
harmful  after-effects.  When  bowel  muscles  are 
temporarily  delayed,  the  right  laxative  gives 
these  muscles  just  a  gentle  nudge,  and  Nature 
is  back  on  the  job. 

Such  a  laxative  is  Ex-Lax. 

The  only  medicinal  ingredient  of  Ex-Lax  is 
phenolphthalein,  a  laxative  widely  known  to 
doctors.  Deliciously  chocolated,  this  scientific 
laxative  ingredient  is  offered  in  its  most  attrac- 
tive form. 

Before  approving  any  laxative,  the  doctor 
wants  to  know  all  about  it.  It  should  not  gripe. 
It  should  not  rush  food  through  thestomach.  It 
should  not  disturb  digestion.  It  should  not 
over-stimulate  the  delicate  intestinal  muscles. 
And  it  should  not  be  habit-forming. 

Doctors  approve  the  Ex-Lax  way 

Ex-Lax  checks  on  every  point  to  the  doctor's 
complete  satisfaction.  Thus  doctors  everywhere 
approve  the  Ex-Lax  way. 

It's  the  way  Ex-Lax  works — rather  than 
mere  "results" — that  will  win  you.  Children 
like  Ex-Lax  as  well  as  grown-ups. 

Get  Ex-Lax  today,  at  your  drug  store.  10c,

1  JACKIE  COOPER  was  on  location  and  be- 
•'  tween  scenes  he  spent  his  time  fishing.  Day 
after  day  the  fish  ignored  him  as  successfully  as 
two  "  best  dressed  women  in  Hollywood " 
ignore  each  other.  Came  time  for  the  big 
scene  in  "When  a  Feller  Needs  a  Friend." 

"All  ready,  Jackie,"  the  assistant  director 
called.     Just  then  Jackie  had  a  nibble. 

So  the  shooting  schedule  had  to  be  re-ar- 
ranged and  Jackie's  scenes  saved  until  later, 
while  Jackie  landed  a  couple  of  oversized 
minnows. 

"AREN'T    you    thrilled    to    have 
**■  played    with    both    the    Barry- 
mores  in  'Arsene  Lupin'?"  a  scenario 
writer  asked  Karen  Morley. 

"Theoretically,  yes,"  Karen  an- 
swered. "But  practically,  no.  Lionel 
is  always  asleep  and  John  is  always 
telling  you  how  to  do  your  scenes." 

'•  f\H,  to  get  away  from  it  all,"  has  been  the 
^^cry  of  many  Hollywood  stars.  "This  be- 
ing stared  at  from  every  table  at  luncheon  is 
getting  on  my  nerves.  Oh,  for  a  quiet  place  to 
eat,  away  from  my  clamoring  public." 

So  Eddie  Brandstatter,  proprietor  of  the  fa- 
mous Hollywood  Montmarte,  heard  the  cry 
and  at  the  request  of  dozens  of  stars,  opened 
the  exclusive  Embassy  club  where  no  out- 
siders were  permitted.  So  the  stars  had  what 
they  wanted,  only  to  find  they  didn't  want  it 
after  all. 


It  became  pretty  monotonous  seeing  the 
same  faces  every  day,  and  one  did  miss  the 
eagerness  of  the  fans.  So  they  flocked  in  a 
l>ody  to  the  Krown  Derby  where  tourists  and 
fans  gather  in  droves  and  the  Embassy  has 
very  quietly  folded  its  hands  and  given  up 
the  ghost. 

What's  the  fun  of  being  a  movie  star  if  you 
aren't  looked  at? 

A  ND  now  it's  the  inside  stuff  of 
Hollywood  cycle  with  Connie 
Bennett  in  "What  Price  Hollywood," 
Harold  Lloyd  in  "Movie  Crazy," 
Universal's  "Once  in  a  Lifetime," 
and  Genevieve  Tobin  in  "Hollywood 
Speaks." 

But  don't  let  the  movie  boys  kid 
you — there  will  still  be  plenty  of  in- 
side stuff  left  to  tell. 

A  UTOGRAPH  selling  is  Hollywood's  new- 
est racket.  At  a  recent  premiere  all  the 
stars  stopped  to  sign  their  names  for  a  little 
old  lady  who  humbly  held  out  her  book. 

After  the  Kleig  lights  were  extinguished  and 
the  last  star  had  arrived,  the  meek  little  lady 
toddled  off  and  sold  the  book  of  autographs  to 
two  waiting  racketeers,  who  in  turn  re-sold  it 
for  a  fancy  price. 

Four  such  autograph  hounds  lay  in  wait  in 
the  shrubbery  of  Garbo's  home  one  night.  As 
her  car  turned  in  the  driveway,  the  men  leaped 
on  the  running  board.    The  driver,  thinking  it

No,  inquiring  reader,  that  isn't  Joan  Marsh's  bare  foot.  Her  five  toes  are

What  will  these  smart  Hollywood

TT'S   a   funny   thing   about   Neil   Hamilton. 

When  he  was  a  leading  man  with  D.  W. 
Griffith,  the  stars  who  ran  him  competition 
were  Earle  Williams,  Bobby  Harron,  Francis 
X.  Bushman,  Antonio  Moreno,  Crane  Wilbur, 
Rudolph  Valentino,  Harrison  Ford,  Dick 
Barthelmess  and  Jack  Mulhall. 

Of  aD  that  list  Neil  and  Dick  Barthelmess 
are  the  only  two  who  are  still  active  in  pictures. 
Three,  of  course,  have  died. 

Neil  figures  that  one  of  the  reasons  he  has 
remained  is  because  he  has  always  taken  what- 
ever role  came  along  and  the  casting  directors 
know  him  as  "a  guy  who'll  do  anything  from 
poiishing  the  door-knobs  to  jumping  off  a 
cliff." 

You  see,  Neil  doesn't  want  to  be  a  star — he'd 
rather  stay  in  pictures  than  to  serve  his 
little  time  of  glory  and  fade  away.  And  even 
after  all  these  years  he  still  loves  to  see  his 
name  in  electric  lights;  to  go  to  premieres  and 
have  people  ask  him  for  his  autograph. 

X_TER  name  was  Nina  Penn.  She  was  a 
blue-eyed,  brown-haired  little  mite  who 
knocked  Broadway,  and  two  hundred  mascu- 
line hearts,  cold. 

Nina  was  sought  after.  Nina  was  popular. 
But  she  gave  her  heart  to  no  one  until  one 
young  actor  persuaded  Nina  that  Broadway 
would  some  day  pass  her  up.  He  loved  her 
ind  begged  her  to  marry  him. 

"Life  for  you,  Nina,  is  only  beginning," 
be  said. 

So  she  married  her  young  actor  and  came  to 
Hollywood,  where  her  husband  clicked  in  the 
movies  and  life  went  smoothly  on — too 
smoothly  for  Nina.  She  wanted  to  don  the 
jrease  paint  and  get  into  things. 

"Don't,"  her  husband  begged,  "you  won't 
ike  it,  Nina.    Life,  for  us,  is  only  beginning." 

The  next  month,  Robert  Williams,  the  young 
ictor,  was  dead.  And  Nina  Penn,  knowing 
that  life  began  and  ended  too  soon,  is  going 
sack  to  the  grease  paint.

WARN  AGAINST  EPIDEMIC  OF 

ATHLETE'S  FOOT 


££ 


59 


Don't  neglect  itching,  peel- 
ing toes9  blisters;  red,  raw, 
cracked  shin  ;  these  can  exact 
a  heavg  penaltg 

TF  THERE'S  any  doubt  as  to  how  alarm- 
-*-  ing  this  epidemic  of  "Athlete's  Foot" 
has  become,  just  glance  through  the  news- 
paper clippings  printed  above. 

If  you  notice  nothing  more  than  an  itch- 
ing between  your  toes — don't  think  it  can't 
mean  danger.  For  usually  that's  the  way 
"Athlete's  Foot"  begins. 

Next  the  skin  may  turn  white,  feel  moist, 
unwholesome.  Or  it  may  turn  red,  as  it 
often  does,  producing  a  rawness  sometimes 
so  painful  that  shoes  cannot  be  worn. 

Don't  let  this  happen  to  you!  And  above 
all  beware  of  breaks  in  the  skin  through 
which  blood  poisoning,  lockjaw  and  ery- 
sipelas may  pass  into  the  blood  stream. 

Watch  your  step  in  places  where 
"Athlete's  Foot"  abounds 

There  is  only  one  answer  as  to  why  millions 
of  people  fall  prey  to  this  insidious  disease. 
And  that  answer  is,  that  the  tiny  ringworm 


germs  which  cause  this  infection  lurk  by  the 
billions  in  the  very  places  people  go  to  pro- 
mote health — on  beachwalks,  on  the  edges 
of  swimming  pools,  on  locker-  and  dressing- 
room  floors,  in  gyms  and  bathhouses — even 
in  your  own  spotless  bathroom. 

Use  Absorbine  Jr.  to  kill  the 
germs  of  "Athlete's  Foot" 

You  may  have  the  first  symptoms*  of 
"Athlete  s  Foot"  without  knowing  it  until 
you  examine  closely  the  skin  between  your 
toes.  At  the  slightest  sign,  douse  on 
Absorbine  Jr.  morning  and  night. 

Laboratory  and  clinical  tests  have  dem- 
onstrated that  Absorbine  Jr.  kills  quickly, 
when  it  reaches  the  germ. 

Absorbine  Jr.  has  been  so  beneficial  that 
substitutes  are  sometimes  offered.  There  is 
too  much  at  stake  to  trust  relief  to  a  "just- 
as-good-as."  There  is  nothing  like  Absor- 
bine Jr.  Take  a  bottle  along  on  every  out- 
ing; that's  wise  precaution.  Price,  SI. 25.

T_TELEN  HAYES— who  suddenly  became 
everybody's  favorite  in  "The  Sin  of  Madc- 
lon  Claudet"  and  "Arrowsmith" — wasn't 
considered  good  movie  material  by  the  lords 
of  the  cinema. 

\\  hen  she  first  came  on  the  lot,  an  executive 
complimented  her  on  her  acting  ability,  but 
added,  "If  you  only  had  a  Norma  Shearer 
face!" 

Helen's  success  all  goes  to  prove  that  beauty 
and  glamour  are  not  always  the  stuff  of  which 
stars  are  made. 

A  YOUNG  extra  player,  his  face  carefully 
made  up  with  grease  paint,  was  hurrying 
down  Hollywood  Boulevard  to  work.  In  his 
excitement  to  get  to  the  studio  on  time  he 
stepped  beforea  car  which  st  ruck  himand  hurled 
him  ten  feet  farther  along  the  boulevard.  Im- 
mediately a  crowd  gathered  and  a  doctor  was 
summoned. 

The  boy  picked  himself  up,  brushed  off  his 
clothes,  took  a  peep  into  a  tiny  handmirror  and 
while  the  doctor  set  his  broken  thumb  re- 
marked, "Gee,  I'm  glad  I  didn't  ruin  that 
make-up.    It  took  me  two  hours  to  put  it  on." 

In  ten  minutes  he  was  on  his  way. 

CPEAKING  of  absent-minded  professors.  .  .  . 
^  Roland  Young  received  a  hurry  up  call  to 
come  to  London  to  make  a  picture.  Roland 
packed  all  the  clothing  he'd  need  for  the  picture 
and  his  stay  in  London,  and  raced  for  the  train. 

Half  way  to  New  York  he  suddenly  remem- 
bered he  hadn't  done  a  thing  with  his  packed 
trunks  but  left  them  standing  in  the  middle  of 
the  bedroom  floor.  He'd  forgotten  to  check 
them. 

So  he  wired  frantically  back  to  have  his 
trunks   sent   airmail.      They   arrived   just   in 


time  to  be  placed  on  the  boat,  and  that  little

"The  Truth  About  Hollywood" 

Wanted — 1  ham  actor

"CVERY  star  in  Hollywood  nurses  hurt  feel- 
ings every  now  and  then.  I  remember  a 
story  Photoplay  published  about  Leila 
Hyams.  It  was  one  of  the  most  innocuous 
little  yarns  ever  written.  But  when  the  writer 
met  Leila  afterwards,  the  Hyams  girl  was  as 
cold  as  the  inside  of  an  electric  refrigerator. 

She  said  the  writer  had  made  her  look  ga-ga 
and  uninteresting.    And  Leila  wanted  glamour. 

TTAROLD  LLOYD  has  been  making  pic- 
tures  fifteen  years  and  has  had  but  six 
leading  ladies.  He  married  one  of  them.  The 
lucky  six  were  Bebe  Daniels,  Mildred  Davis, 
Jobyna  Ralston,  Ann  Christy,  Barbara  Kent — 
and  now  Constance  Cummings  in  "Movie 
Crazy,"  the  new  flicker. 

COMETIMES  you'll  find  a  real  heart  throb 
'"'in  the  "props"  used  on  sets.  An  expensive 
town  car  is  being  used  in  one  of  the  scenes  for 
"What  Price  Hollywood."  And  once  that 
car  proudly  bore  a  famous  and  glamorous 
star  about  in  its  luxurious  depths.  The  star 
faded  from  the  picture  and  sold  the  car  to  a 
famous  director.  He  heard  the  drums  of 
doom,  too,  and  sold  the  car  to  a  rental  agency. 
And  now  that  once  bright  chariot  is  a  prop. 
Things  like  that  really  do  happen  in  Holly- 
wood more  times  than  we  like  to  think  about.

Photoplay  Magazine  for  July,  1932

Here's  Good  News 

for  you  YEAST  EATERS! 


Lewis  Stone  played  only  a  small  part 
in  Joan  Crawford's  "Letty  Lynton." 
Yet  when  he  appeared  on  the  screen, 
a  murmur  went  around  the  Capitol 
theater  in  New  York,  "There's  Lewis 
Stone,  oh,  there's  Lewis  Stone." 
Which  proves  that,  although  Stone 
has  played  only  character  roles  dur- 
ing the  past  several  years,  his  audi- 
ence is  greater  than  that  of  many  stars 


■p\ICK  ARLEN  and  Jobyna  Ralston  had 
■^planned  to  go  to  Europe  but  Dick  got  a 
chance  to  play  with  Eddie  Robinson  in  "Tiger 
Shark. "  It's  a  swell  part  and  nets  Dick  S25.000 
extra  for  it  will  be  made  during  Dick's  vaca- 
tion. What's  more,  it  will  be  filmed  along  the 
Mexican  coast  and  Joby  and  Dick  are  going 
together  in  their  own  yacht — which  combines 
work  with  a  swell  vacation.  And  the  kids 
think  it's  better  than  going  to  Europe  and 
paying  their  own  expenses. 

Everybody  is  happy  about  it  for  those  two 
youngsters  certainly  deserve  a  break.  They 
have  remained  absolutely  unchanged  in  the 
changing  atmosphere  of  Hollywood.  Married 
five  years — they  have  lived  in  the  same  house 
and  kept  just  one  servant.  Either  can  always 
be  reached  by  phone — no  secretaries  to  say, 
"Just  a  moment,  I'll  see  if  Mr.  Arlen  is  in." 
They're  natural,  unspoiled  and  unsophisticated . 

TT'S  not  because  her  producers  are  trying  to 
build  her  up  to  be  a  second  Garbo  that  Gwili 
Andre  is  not  allowed  to  be  interviewed.  The 
answer  is  simple.  The  girl  is  new  at  the  studio 
and  she's  frightened.  She  shakes  with  fear 
every  time  she  walks  on  a  set  and,  besides,  the 
company  figures  that  if  she  doesn't  make  good 
she  won't  suffer  the  embarrassment  of  a  big 
publicity  campaign  with  nothing  to  back  it  up. 
A  couple  of  months  ago  Photoplay  told  you 
all  about  Gwili,  the  highest  paid  artists'  model 
in  New  York.  When  she  first  hit  Hollywood 
a  drama  teacher  with  a  great  reputation  was 
supplied  for  her. 

"Act  like  a  tree,"  he  told  her.  "Hold  your 
arms  out  as  if  they  were  branches. " 

Gwili  was  puzzled.   "A  tree?"  she  repeated. 

"Yes,  act  like  a  tree." 

Gwili  was  confused.  She  began  to  cry.  An 
executive  happened  to  notice  her  in  tears.  "I

ordinary  yeast.  They  have  a  delicate,  nut- 
like flavor  that  everybody  likes,  even  the 
children.  They  cannot  cause  gas  or  fermen-

to  children.  They  contain  no  drugs.  They 
are  nothing  but  pure  yeast  dried  and  con- 
centrated into  convenient  tablet  form._  So 
pure  and  so  uniform  is  this  yeast  that  it  is 
used  by  the  U.  S.  Government  and  leading 
Universities  for  their  research  in  vitamins. 
In  fact  Yeast  Foam  Tablets  are  the  richest

Feels  Like  a  Boy  Again:  "When  I  wrote  you 
for  a  sample  of  Yeast  Foam  Tablets  I  was  so 
badly  run  down  with  constipation  that  I  could 
not  sleep  well  or  do  a  full  day's  work  and  suf- 
fered with  headache  most  of  the  lime.  Now  after 
taking  six  bottles  of  Tablets  I  am  free  from  both 
the  disorders  mentioned  above  and  I  feel  like  a 
healthy  boy  of  eighteen."        Bridgman,  Mich.

Photoplay  Magazine  for  July,  1932 

"CAN  mail,  which  was  once  considered  the 
barometer  of  public  interest  in  a  star,  has 
taken  like  everything  else,  a  decided  drop.  And 
the  funny  part  is  that  the  stars  and  producers 
don't  worry  much  about  it.  The  point  is  that 
it's  box-office  receipts  and  not  letters  which 
really  count.  Oh,  certainly,  the  stars  still  like 
to  get  your  letters,  but  the  producers  don't 
measure  popularity  that  way  any  more. 

During  her  heyday  Clara  Bow  received 
30,000  letters  a  week.  Buddy  Rogers  was  a 
close  second.  Today,  Sylvia  Sidney  receives 
more  mail  than  anybody  else  at  Paramount 
and  it  averages  about  1,500  letters  weekly. 

/^\NE  of  the  reasons  for  the  drop  is  the  fact 
^-^that  the  studios  used  to  send  out  pictures 
of  the  stars  free — now  they  charge  ten  cents 
for  5  by  7  pictures  and  twenty-five  cents  for 
an  8  by  10.  The  mail  took  a  fifty  per  cent 
slump  right  after  that. 

When  this  drop  became  obvious,  First 
National  and  Radio  began  giving  the  5  by  7 
pictures  free.  Some  stars  send  out  free  pic- 
tures— others  don't.  Connie  Bennett  pays  a 
great  deal  of  attention  to  her  mail.  Clark 
Gable,  Bob  Montgomery  and  Norma  Shearer 
send  pictures  if  a  letter  is  particularly  inter- 
esting. 

A  LTHOUGH  fan  mail  makes  the  stars  feel 
fine  and  the  studios  think  it  good  publicity, 
it  doesn't  really  count.  Mary  Brian  was  kept 
on  at  Paramount  during  the  last  few  months 
partly  because  her  mail  was  so  prodigious. 
But  when  Marian  Marsh  had  her  little  squabble 


at  First  National  the  amount  of  her  fan  mail — 
which  was  great — did  not  carry  any  weight 
with  the  producers. 

XT  AURICE  CHEVALIER  has  a  swell  dis- 
position and  is  absolutely  minus  any  French 
temperament,  but  just  try  being  ten  minutes 
late  for  an  appointment  with  Maurie  and  you 
could  go  into  widow's  weeds  with  all  the  black 
looks  you'll  get. 

Maurice  is  always  on  time  himself  and  he 
expects  it  from  everyone  else. 

Norma  Shearer  is  another  punctual  person. 
She  maps  out  her  day  to  the  last  minute.  When 
she  first  married  Irving  Thalberg  she  realized 
that  a  set  meal  schedule  was  impossible — what 
with  Irving  working  all  sorts  of  weird  hours  at 
the  studio.  So  meals  are  served  a  la  short  order 
restaurant  in  the  Thalberg-Shearer  menage. 
Everyone  eats  when  it's  convenient  and  no 
one  keeps  the  other  fellow  waiting. 

JIMMY  DURANTE  was  riding  along 
in  his  car  and  made  some  sort  of 
■wrong  turn.  An  irate  driver  yelled, 
"Say  who  do  you  think  you  are?" 

So  Jimmy  stuck  his  nose  out  and 
yelled  back,  "I  don't  think.  I'm 
positive!" 

XTOW  it's  Wynne  Gibson  who  is  Leading 
iN  Her  Own  Life. 

The  girl  who  became  an  overnight  star  in 
"The  Strange  Case  of  Clara  Deane"  has  been 
invited  to  the  Mayfair  parties  eight  times. 
She  has  never  gone.

Schlag" — which  I  think  means  "Two  Hearts 
and  One  Sock  in  the  Nose."  Anyhow,  that's 
close. 

Hcrr  Schramm,  in  fact,  tells  me  that  there 
is  a  move  on  foot  to  forbid  the  making  of  any 
talkie  in  Germany  that  hasn't  "Two  Hearts" 
in  the  title.  If  it  goes  through,  the  names  of 
all  German  pictures  will  be  things  like  "Two 
Hearts  in  a  Shanghai  Express,"  "Two  Hearts 
in  Tarzan,"  "Two  Hearts  in  a  Grand  Hotel," 
and  "Two  Hearts,  Doubled  and  Re-Doubled." 
Well,  that's  one  way  to  make  dough,  eh,  editor? 

Small  wonder  these  Berliners  want  to  laugh. 
Their  serious  pictures  are  so  terrible  that  you 
want  to  blubber  and  bawl  for  hours!  Add 
that  to  the  fact  that  their  movie  theaters  are 
so  dark  you  could  die  in  them  and  be  missing 
for  three  weeks,  and  you  have  another  real 
problem. 

A  XD  that,  editor,  is  just  what  I'm  wrestling 
■'With!  I'm  sorry,  but  it  looks  as  though  I 
would  have  to  give  up  that  Siberian  trip  you 
ordered — also  the  ones  to  Turkestan  and  Albania 
that  I  thought  up  myself .  It  will  take  at  least  all 
summer  for  me  to  get  the  Berlin  bozos  all 
straightened  out  on  the  Dick  und  Dof — or 
Laurel  and  Hardy — thing. 

Then  there's  another  trouble — somebody 
must  have  put  chewing  gum  or  something  on 
my  seat  at  this  "bar."  I've  been  trying  to  get 
off  it  and  out  for  five  days,  and  Hcrr  Schramm 
and  four  waiters  have  been  helping,  but  it's  no 
use. 

I  guess  I'll  just  have  to  sit  here  through  July 
and  August,  worrying  my  poor  brains  out 
about  the  picture  situation  in  Berlin.  I'm 
sorry  about  Siberia — I'd  like  nothing  better 
than  to  go  out  there  and  play  with  the  Sibes. 
But  you'll  just  have  to  forgive  me  —  you 
wouldn't  want  me  to  sacrifice  the  seat  of  my 
pants  just  to  get  off  this  stool! 

In  the  meantime,  tell  all  American  producers 
to  ship  over  500,000  prints  of  every  comedy 
they  can  dig  up.  Help  the  Berliners  get  their 
minds  off  politics,  and  maybe  I  can  get  off 
this  stool  in  time  to  come  home  and  vote  for 
Laurel  and  Hardy. 

And  by  the  way,  editor,  Hcrr  Schramm  has 
just  said  something  about  paying  a  bill — what 
a  bore,  eh?  So  ship  me  a  few  thousand  marks, 
which  you  can  pick  up  for  American  money 
easily.  I'm  sure  you  don't  mind  about  Siberia 
—I  don't.  So  I'll  see  you  in  the  fall,  editor, 
if  I  dare.  I'm  sure  glad  you  aren't  here  where 
you  have  to  drink  this  "beer."  It  tastes 
terrible — sort  of  bitter-like. 

I'll  cable  you  anything  new  on  this  Berlin 
situation,  such  as  Babe  Hardy  beating  out 
Hindenburg  for  President.  Remember.  I  am 
always  Photoplay's  hottest,  keenest  reporter.

The  Baby  of  the  Family 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  51 


heartily  than — your  hearers.  But  here  the 
r?ere  solemn,  discreet,  the  voices  low,  the 
manners  punctilious.  Only  the  wit  sparkled 
and  crackled  about  the  table.  1  remember 
when  it  suddenly  came  to  me,  like  a  delight- 
ful discovery,  "Why,  they're  joking/" 

They  were  all  like  that.  A  marvelous 
family.  And  always  when  Fred  came  out  on 
top,  they  were  prouder  than  he  was  of  his  suc- 
cess. But  they  wouldn't  show  it.  ("We 
mustn't  spoil  him.") 

"C  VER  since  Fred  was  old  enough  to  talk  he 
-'-'has  spoken  "pieces."  His  first  selections  were 
about  a  little  colored  boy  named  "Poor  Little 
Mose."  From  that  he  went  on  to  more  am- 
bitious subjects.  While  he  was  still  in  short 
trousers  his  father  went  with  him  upstate 
where  he  won  the  State  Oratorical  Contest, 
the  youngest  of  all  the  contestants.  That  was 
a  proud  day  for  the  Bickels. 

And  from  his  babyhood  he  has  loved  to 
imitate  people. 

"But  always,"  as  an  older  member  of  the 
family  once  recalled  seriously,  much  to  our 
joy,  "in  the  kindliest  manner!" 

And  on  the  heart  interest  side,  ever  since 
his  baby  days,  Fred  has  had  girls.  Or  rather 
A  girl.  For  with  Fred  it  was  always  one  at  a 
time  and  each  time  it  was  "yes,  but  this  is 
different!" 

He  always  took  his  love  affairs  very  seriously, 
and  yet  family  approval  was  important  to 
him.  too. 

But  when  he  let  himself  fall  there  were  no 
half  measures — he  fell  hard,  and  stayed  down. 
Until  the  next  one. 

Recently,  when  we  were  all  re-unioning  in 
Racine,  we  came  across  a  motto  Fred  had  kept 
in  his  mirror  for  years: 

"Be  a  Whole  Man  to  One  Thing  at  a  Time," 
and  his  wife  suggested  that  it  should  have 
been,  "Be  a  Whole  .Man  to  One  Girl  at  a 
Time"! 

He  told  me  once,  when  he  was  twenty-two 
— we  were  on  a  train  bound  for  New  York, 
both  of  us  with  the  glamorous  adventure  ahead 
of  actually  living,  for  the  first  time,  in  Xew 
York — "I  am  fascinated  by  the  idea  of  being 
true  to  one  woman  all  my  life." 

Even  then  he  was,  unconsciously,  play-act- 
ing. He  would  tell  of  some  terrific  quarrel  he 
had  had  with  the  girl  of  the  moment  and  ex- 
claim, "Gosh,  it  was  dramatic!"  His  eyes 
would  shine  so,  his  voice  would  fairly  tremble, 
and  before  you  knew  it,  you,  too,  felt  that  it 
was  terribly  important,  although  you  knew,  in 
a  way,  that  you  were  only  seeing  footlights 
and  feeling  the  glamour  of  the  stage. 

Now  at  last,  however,  it  looks  as  if  he  is 
going  to  make  good  on  that  threat  of  being 
"true  to  one  girl  all  his  life."  His  happy 
marriage  to  Florence  Eldridge,  enduring 
quietly  in  a  city  of  easy  divorces  and  re- 
matings,  shows  every  sign  of  having  "taken." 
Five  years  is  a  long  while  in  Hollywood. 

His  family's  present  pride  in  him  is  not  only 
for  his  success  but  because  that  success  has 
made  him  neither  arrogant  nor  cynical.  He 
is  still  devoted  to  shaping  his  life  to  contain 
the  things  that  endure:  friendships — love  in 
his  marriage — doing  a  conscientious  job. 

rT"HOUGH  my  husband  is  more  and  more 
•^  proud  of  him,  he  still,  big  brother  fashion, 
can't  or  won't  show  it.  When  the  first  re- 
views began  to  praise  Fred,  Jack  was  so  care- 
fully laconic  that  his  only  comment  to  Fred 
was — and  this,  too,  has  become  a  household 
word:  "That  won't  do  any  harm." 

Nowadays  Fred  anticipates  him  and  it  is  he 
who  first  remarks  to  Jack  about  a  good  notice, 
"This  won't  do  any  harm,  will  it?"  They 
understand  each  other. 

Fred  has  been  the  perfect  uncle  to  our  two 


children.  He  has  taken  turns  at  wheeling  my 
baby  carriage  with  admirable  composure;  he 
has  had  the  patience  to  overcome  the  tongue- 
tied  self-consciousness  the  older  daughter 
developed  in  his  presence  after  he  became  a 
celebrity,  and  persuade  her  that  he  was  just 
"Uncle  Freddie"  after  all.  He  still  kisses  his 
father  with  utter  naturalness,  still  listens  with 
a  very  real  respect  to  the  brave  and  wise  advice 
of  this  parent  who  has  known  so  well  when  to 
guide  and  when  to  leave  alone.  "I  can  trust 
you  to  do  the  right  thing,  my  boy,"  he'll  say 
with  his  hand  on  Fred's  knee. 

When  the  children  were  asking  for  in- 
scribed photographs,  one  day,  and  he  had 
obligingly  written,  "To  my  beautiful  blonde 
sweetheart.  Barbara,"  and  "To  my  favorite 
comic,  Jane" — I  asked  for  one,  too,  so  he 
wrote,  "To  Mary — my  very  first  sister-in- 
law." 

/""\F  course,  that  was  terrible.  I  was  highly 
^'incensed.  I  said,  "It's  like  writing  'To  the 
very  first  woman  I  meet  on  the  street  after  ten 
o'clock  next  Thursday  morning.'"'  I  pre- 
tended I  had  burned  it  up. 

So,  one  day.  to  make  up  for  it,  he  wrote 
another  and  inscribed  that  one: 

"To  Marj-.  I  love  you!  I  love  you!  I  Love 
You!" 

Now,  all  I'm  waiting  for  is  for  him  to  make 
his  first  cool  (no,  it  won't  be  cool  under  those 
Klieg  lights)  million,  and  then,  heavily  veiled, 
I  am  going  to  appear  at  his  lawyer's  office  one 
fine  morning  and  do  a  little  business  in  black- 
mail. 

Quite  a  pretty  scandal  I  could  make  out  of 
that.  "Your  money  or  your  reputation."  I 
shall  hiss. 

As  I  think  of  Fred  there  seems  to  be  a 
strange  affinity  between  him  and  bathtubs. 
It  isn't  only  because  of  the  famous  bath  scene 
in  'The  Royal  Family."  when  Ina  Claire  and 
Henrietta  Crosman  watched  him  take  a  bath 
in  order  to  hear  his  story. 

It  isn't  only  that  a  little  girl  said  to  us  the 
other  day,  "Oh,  my  auntie  knows  Fredric 
March!  She  broke  her  rib  in  his  bathtub.  She 
was  so  thrilled!" 

It  developed  that  her  aunt  had  visited  some 
people  in  Beverly  Hills  who  had  occupied  the 
March  house  after  they  came  East,  and  having 
bathed,  slipped  and  broken  her  rib,  all  in  his 
tub,  her  niece  felt  she  must  know  him  at  least 
fairly  well. 

You  can't  blame  her. 

No.  I  think  it  is  because  of  our  own  priceless 
bathroom  story  about  Fred.  When  Barbara 
was  about  three,  Fred  was  in  the  bathroom  {the 
bathroom.  I  might  add)  running  water  for  a 
bath.  Barbara  was  outside  clamoring  to  get 
in,  a  noise  he  could  not  hear  above  the  running 
water. 

We  heard  her  call,  "Fred,  let  me  in!"  And 
then,  more  urgently,  "Fred,  let  me  in!"  And 
finally,  in  exasperation:  "Oh,  Uncle  Fred,  let 
me  in!    What's  tin-  difference.'.'" 

NOWADAYS  we,  who  stand  on  the  side- 
lines, look  back,  as  people  do.  and  try  to 
analyze  the  secret  of  his  success.  His  last  visit 
home  was  a  fair  indication  of  that  success.  It 
must  have  been  little  short  of  a  riot.  The 
citizenry  apparently  let  themselves  go  in  hero- 
worship  with  a  fine  abandon  that  Freddie  him- 
self must  have  felt  on  one  historic  occasion  of 
his  early  youth,  when  someone  had  a  divine  in- 
spiration. Fred  still  tells  about  it  and  its 
beginning  is  always  thus: 

"Let's  have  a  paint  fight!"  says  Jimmy. 
"All  right,"  says  Yinny. 
"So  we  has  a  paint  light!"

tended  for  a  family  visit,  said:  "Nothing  was 
lacking  but  the  brass  band.  We  had  reporters, 
photographers,  crowds  of  small  boys — cars 
parked  across  the  street,  cleaners  offering  to 
clean  suits  gratis,  aldermen  offering  to  conduct 
Freddie  and  party  through  the  new  court 
house,  radio,  telegrams,  and  an  incessant  phone 
ringing,  to  say  nothing  of  Mrs.  March  in  a 
corner  grinding  her  teeth  and  making  weird 


IT  seems  a  far  cry  from  the  lonely  boy  who 
lived  in  a  cheap  rooming  house  in  Brooklyn, 
tating  insufficient  and  irregular  meals,  de- 
veloping acute  appendicitis  suddenly  and  not 
knowing  the  name  of  a  single  doctor,  but  hav- 
ing the  luck  to  have  a  kind  and  sensible  land- 
lady who  found  one  for  him  (both  the  doctor 
and  the  landlady  have  been  two  of  his  good 
friends  ever  since). 

A  boy,  whose  brother,  hardly  more  ex- 
perienced, was  summoned  in  the  middle  of  the 
night  faced  with  the  grave  responsibility  of 
deciding  whether  or  not  to  let  this  unknown 
doctor  operate  and  later  thanking  God  that 
he  had — a  boy  who,  during  his  convalescence 
had  the  time  to  think  things  out  and  decide 
that  the  stage  was  the  only  life  he  could  live 
and  be  happy. 

It  was  a  decision  that  was  gravely  momen- 
tous. For  the  first  time  he  had  no  parental 
approval  backing  him  up.  His  parents  were 
devout  church  people  of  the  old  school,  and 
the  stage  as  a  profession,  naturally  seemed  to 
them  not  only  frivolous  but  almost  an  in- 
vention of  the  devil.  But  Fred,  for  the  first 
time,  knew! 

He  felt  so  unalterably  right  about  it  that  he 
stood  squarely  against  everything,  feeling  his 
power,  defying  the  world  to  prove  he  had  made 
a  mistake.  When  our  little  girl  Jane  came, 
and  we  gave  her  "March"  for  a  middle  name 
(he  had  only  recently  changed  his  name),  he 
wrote,  I  suppose  feeling  very  unpopular  with  his 
family  just  then  and  as  if  he  were  very  much 
the  black  sheep,  a  humorously  pathetic  letter 
about  it.  "I  feel,"  he  said  in  effect,  "like 
some  little  new  country  getting  its  first  dip- 
lomatic recognition  from  one  of  the  old  line 
powers." 

After  leaving  his  job  at  the  bank  came,  of 
course,  that  rather  heart-breaking  period  most 
young  artists  must  go  through,  when,  as  far  as 
the  stage  was  concerned,  he  was  almost  con- 
tinuously "at  leisure"  (or  do  they  call  it 
"resting"?). 

Anyway,  he  posed  for  collar  ads,  for  under- 
wear ads,  toothpaste  ads — he  posed  for  illustra- 
tors, among  whom  were  Howard  Chandler 
Christy  and  Neysa  McMein — anything  to  keep 
the  wolf  from  growling. 

And  then  the  two-line  part  in  Belasco's 
"Deburau,"  which  was  the  beginning. 

"The  rest,"  as  I  like  to  say  dramatically, 
along  with  better  men  than  I  am,  "is  history!" 

Last  summer  after  Barbara  went  to  camp, 
the  Marches  and  the  Bickels  visited  her  there. 
The  little  girls  gather  around  Fred  as  we  sit 
on  the  cots  chatting  with  them.  Big-eyed  kids, 
shyly  sitting  around,  watching  every  move  he 
makes.  Finally  one  of  them  gets  up  her  courage 
and  says: 

"Is  it  very  hard  to  get  into  the  movies,  Mr. 
March?" 

"pRFD  looks  at  us  helplessly  and  we  all  laugh 
■*-  a  little,  all  thinking  the  same  thing — what's 
the  answer  to  a  question  like  that?  First  he 
was  there,  on  the  outside,  and  now  he's  here,  a 
movie  star.  How  did  he  get  there?  We  don't 
know — he  doesn't  know — nobody  knows. 

Was  it  because  his  mother  taught  him  to  "Be 
a  whole  man  to  one  thing  at  a  time"?  Was  it 
because  he  is  handsome  and  has  a  musical 
speaking  voice?  Wasit  because  of  the  job  at  the 
National  City  Bank  which  brought  him  to  New 
York  in  the  first  place?  Was  it  because  of 
that  convalescence  from  appendicitis  which 
gave  him  the  leisure  to  find  out  he  wanted  to 
go  on  the  stage? 

Yes.  It  was  all  those  things.  All  those.  And 
a  thousand  others. 


How  To  Really 

Get  Rid  Of 

Arm  And  Leg  Hair 

Utterly  Without  the  Problem  of  Coarsened  Re-growth 


By  a  total  lack  of  stubble  you  can  feel  the  dif- 
ference between  this  and  old  ways. 


A  Discovery  That  is  Proving  to  the 
Wonder  of  the  Cosmetic  World  That 
Hair  Can  Not  Only  Be  Removed  In- 
stantly, But  Its  Reappearance  Delayed 
Amazingly. 

A  way  of  removing  arm  and  leg  hair  has 
been  found  that  not  only  removes  every 
vestige  of  hair  instantly,  but  that  banishes 
the  stimulated  hair  growth  thousands  of 
women  are  charging  to  the  razor  and  less 
modern  ways.  A  way  that  not  only  removes 
hair,  but  delays  its  reappearance  remarkably. 

It  is  changing  previous  conceptions  of  cos- 
meticians about  hair  removing.  Women  are 
flocking  to  its  use.  The  creation  of  a  noted 
laboratory,  it  is  different  from  any  other 
hair  remover  known. 

What  It  Is 

It  is  an  exquisite  toilet  creme  resembling  a 
superior  beauty  clay  in  texture.  You  simply

slowed  amazingly. 


spread  it  on  where  hair  is  to  be  removed. 
Then  rinse  off  with  water. 
That  is  all.  Every  vestige  of  hair  is  gone; 
so  completely  that  even  by  running  your 
hand  across  the  skin  not  the  slightest  trace 
of  stubble  can  be  felt.  And — the  reappear- 
ance of  thai  hair  is  delayed  surprisingly! 

When  re-growth  finally  does  come,  it  is  ut- 
terly unlike  the  re-growth  following  the 
razor  and  old  ways.  You  can  feel  the  differ- 
ence. No  sharp  stubble.  No  coarsened  growth. 

The  skin,  too,  is  left  soft  as  a  child's.  No 
skin  roughness,  no  enlarged  pores.  You  feel 
freer  than  probably  ever  before  in  your  life 
of  annoying  hair  growth.

Come  On  Back,  Mitzi 


CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  41 


person    like    Mitz    would    be    the    rankest   of 

indignities. 

For  Mitzi  is  one  of  those  amazing  children 
who  know  a  great  deal  more  than  fifty  per  cent 
of  the  adults  of  the  world — and  maybe  that's 
a  conservative  estimate.  Mitzi  Green's  clear 
eyes  need  but  to  take  you  in,  from  head  to 
foot,  and  boy,  oh,  boy,  you've  been  taken  in. 
She  has  a  sort  of  uncanny  knowledge  for  the 
sort  of  person  you  are  and,  well  behaved  as  she 
i>,  perfectly  proper  at  all  times,  she  leaves  you 
with  the  feeling  that  she  is  thinking  incredible 
thoughts  about  you  and  knows  your  innermost 
secrets,  your  small  meannesses  and  vanities  at 
a  glance. 

Don't  misunderstand  me.  There's  no  second 
sight  about  Mitzi.  She's  a  healthy,  well  fed, 
round  cheeked  child,  who  loves  to  play  and 
have  fun  like  any  other  child.  But  she  has  a 
mind  which  is  far  and  away  above  the  average. 
Maybe  it's  that  uncanny  gaze.  It  makes  you 
feel  at  once  that  you  must  accept  Mitzi  as  your 
equal  and  none  of  that  "dear  little  kiddie'' 
stufF. 

Old  time  troupers  dread  to  play  with  Mitzi 
because  she's  one  of  the  champ  scene  stealers 
of  Hollywood.  And  Lilyan  Tashman  tells  a 
swell  yarn  that  concerns  the  making  of  "  Finn 
and  Hattie. "    Seems  Mitz  had  been  stealing 


scenes  right  out  from  under  Lil's  sophisticated 
nose.  Finally  /../  Tashman  decided  that  she'd 
appeal  to  the  child's  Better  Xature,  so  she 
said,  "Come  on,  Mitzi.  give  Aunt  Lil  a  break. 
Let  me  get  this  next  scene  over  and  you  can 
have  all  the  rest. " 

•  All  right.''  Then  Mitzi  walked  before  the 
cameras  and  during  Lilyan's  scene  made  one 
of  those  goofy  faces,  and  that  drew  every  eye- 
away  from  Lil  and  toward  Mitzi. 

Yet  Mitzi,  herself,  looks  at  you  in  wide-eyed 
amazement  when  you  accuse  her  of  thefting  a 
little  scene  occasionally. 

"  I  sometimes  think, "  said  the  actress,  "  that 
I  don't  do  enough  before  the  camera.  In  my 
first  picture,  'The  Marriage  Playground,'  I 
just  stood  there  and  looked  up  at  the  other 
players. " 

But  practically  all  Mitzi  has  to  do  is  to  "just 
stand  there  and  look  up"  and  the  scene  is  hers. 

You  never  know  what  Mitzi  is  really  think- 
ing. You  never  know  what  she's  going  to  do 
next  when  she's  before  a  microphone.  And 
maybe  that's  why  at  least  three  wise  directors 
have  confided  to  me  that  Mitzi  Green  is  one  of 
the  best  actresses  in  Hollywood.  And  they 
didn't  mean  "just  a  cute  little  kiddie'' — what 
they  meant  was  a  darn  good,  all-round  screen 
performer! 


The  Lion  Tamer  of  "Grand  Hotel 


" 


(  ONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  33 


Hersholt  turned  to  Stone.  "It's  curious, 
but  you  do  get  hungry  around  twelve  o'clock.  " 

Joan  departed. 

"  Lunch?  "  inquired  Stone  looking  squarely 
at  Goulding. 

'•  Looks  like  it!"  said  the  grim-lipped  Gould- 
ing. 

Hersholt  re-opened  his  script.  "Let's  stay 
and  finish,  if  you  wish.  I'm  already  out  of  the 
picture,  though!" 

"So  am  I,"  said  Stone.    "Shall  we  go?" 

"I  suppose  so,"  the  lion  tamer  nodded. 

One  man  was  left.  His  head  had  fallen  on 
his  arm.  It  was  Lionel  Barrymore— sound 
asleep. 

THE  Yellow  Room."  You  remember  the 
set  from  the  picture. 

An  orchestra  played — yet  there  was  no 
sound. 

Hundreds  of  extras  laughing  and  talking — 
yet  no  one  could  hear  them. 

Cocktails  were  shaken — and  the  ice  did  not 
tinkle. 

Did  you  know  that  sound  is  put  in  after- 
wards in  ensembles;  scenes  where  there  are 
numerous  people?  Only  the  principals  speak 
their  lines  while  the  scene  is  taken. 

The  whole  set  seemed  a  bit  mad;  there  was 
a  weird  abnormality  in  the  silence.  The  ears 
seemed  cheated.  One  felt  a  sense  of  disappoint- 
ment. 

Unexpectedly,  the  queer  suspense  was  re- 
lieved.  A  voice  leapt  out. 

"Can  you  get  them  into  position?"  Assistant 
Lion  Tamer  speaking. 

Goulding  walked  before  a  camera;  took  a 
position;  marked  the  floor  with  a  chalk  line, 
raised  his  hand,  containing  a  white  handker- 
chief, two  feet  above  his  head  to  indicate 
Beery's  height.    "This  is  your  place.  Beery." 

He  walked  to  another  spot,  twisting  his  body 
with  an  almost  effeminate  movement  in  his 
imitation.    "This  will  be  Crawford." 

You  would  not  have  recognized  ^Vally  Beery 
as  he  stepped  into  his  position.  Tail-coat; 
shaved    head;    high    collar.     No    wonder    he 


didn't  like  to  play  Preysing,  the  German 
industrial  magnate.  Beery,  who  lets  his  sus- 
penders hang  while  he  is  eating! 

"Get  in,  Jack!  There's  your  mark!"  Beery 
called  to  Jack  Barrymore  who  walked  slowly 
to  his  position. 

"Here?"  He  inquired  of  Goulding  much  in 
the  tone  in  which  one  says  "cab"  to  a  hotel 
doorman. 

"Yes,"  snapped  Goulding  much  in  the  tone 
of  one  answering  a  waiter  who  has  proffered  a 
potato. 

"Here?" 

The  emphasis  in  Jack's  repetition  made 
Goulding  turn  around.  Barrymore's  neck  was 
squarely  in  the  lens  of  the  camera. 

"  I've  got  another  camera  covering  you,  Jack 
— from  the  good  side.  I  figured  it  out  this 
morning. " 

Jack  smiled.    His  profile  was  protected. 

"I  can't  tell  one  side  of  my  mug  from  the 
other!"  wailed  Beery. 

"Speaking  of  the  sides  of  one  face,"  a  voice 
came  from  the  rear  of  the  set.  "Will  I  be 
wanted  for  the  next  hour?  My  ear  has  split 
from  the  adhesive  tape.  It's  tearing  it  in  two.  " 
It  was  Lew  Stone.  His  remarkable  make-up 
in  the  picture  probably  frightened  you. 

"I'm  sorry.  I  must  ask  you  to  stay.  But 
I'm  using  the  other  side  of  your  face  in  this 
shot.    I  figured  it  out  litis  morning/" 

Lew  Stone's  voice  was  heard  asking  for  the 
ether  pot.  He  asked  for  it  frequently  during 
the  making  of  the  picture.  It's  for  removing 
adhesive  tape  used  in  make-up. 

ALOUD  blare  from  a  loud  gramaphone. 
Bing  Crosby's  voice  crooning:  "  Can't  We 
Talk  It  Over,  Dear?" 

Joan  Crawford  was  preparing  her  emotions 
for  her  scene. 

Beery  raised  his  voice :  "  Bing  Crosby  should 
get  screen  credit!" 

Jack  Barrymore's  glance  flashed  to  \YaIly. 
There  was  an  instant  of  friendship.  A  mutual 
feeling  of  kinship  electrified  the  two  men  for 
that  brief  moment. 


"My  collar's  wilting,"  Beery  snapped  back 
to  normal.  "  You're  cooking  me  with  those 
lights." 

"Ask  Miss  Crawford  to  come  here,"  said 
Goulding. 

"I've  told  her.  She's  fixing  her  make-up," 
answered  the  Assistant  Lion  Tamer. 

"I've  got  nothing  to  fix,  but  my  collar's 
wilting, "  called  Beery. 

"  Mine's  fixed  now, "  announced  Lewis  Stone. 

"Is  it  painful?"  inquired  Goulding. 

"No,"  replied  Stone. 

Goulding  knew  he  was  lying.  "You're  a 
good  sport,  Lew, "  he  said  gratefully. 

"So  are  you,  Eddie.    I've  been  watching." 

AFLUTTER;  a  rustle;  a  tension  among 
the  extras.  "Shoot,"  said  Joan,  "I'm 
here. " 

It  was  a  joke.  Joan's  eyes  were  twinkling. 
Intuitively  she  took  exactly  the  right  position. 
Directors  say  she  is  the  most  camera-wise 
woman  in  pictures. 

Goulding  looked  around.  Beery  was  missing. 
Changing  his  collar.    "All  right,  Wally!" 

"Can't  you  line  her  up  without  me?  You 
don't  have  to  bother  about  me.  All  you've 
had  is  the  back  of  my  neck  in  most  of  this 
picture!"  boomed  Wally. 

"  Can  I  see  Mr.  Barrymore  in  that  other 
camera?"  called  the  cameraman. 

"Does  Jack  have  a  special  camera  now?" 
called  Beery  as  he  stumped  back  to  place. 

It  was  in  fun,  but  the  lion  tamer  looked  up 
quickly — looked  for  his  whip  to  crack  it.  There 
had  been  too  much  kidding.  Truths  often  lurk 
behind  jest. 

Jack  was  getting  out  of  humor  and  when 
the  Barrymores  are  out  of  humor  or  out  of 
mood — the  scene  shows  it. 

Five  minutes  later  the  orchestra  played 
silently.  A  hundred  people  danced  without 
sound. 

Lionel,  who  had  been  awakened  from  his 
chair  two  minutes  earlier,  was  saying  his  lines 
to  Jack.  He  stopped  abruptly.  The  camera 
clicked;  the  right  lights  snapped  out. 

"I'm  sorry,"  mumbled  Lionel.  "The  lines 
have  gone.    We  should  rehearse." 

"Rehearse,  then!"  ordered  Goulding. 

"  Eddie,  I'm  stale, "  said  Crawford. 

"  I  can't  rehearse, "  said  Beery. 

"It's  such  a  good  scene  if  I  can  only  get  it," 
pleaded  Goulding. 

"Any  good  scene  needs  rehearsing,"  an- 
swered Lionel. 

"Lunch,"  said  Beery. 

"Lunch?"  called  Joan  in  a  tone  of  inquiry. 

"Yes!"  answered  Beery. 

"Was  that  lunch?"  called  John  from  the 
other  camera. 

"I  don't  know,"  answered  his  brother. 

An  extra  girl  touched  her  girl  friend,  sewing 
up  her  stocking.  "  Don't  bother  about  it  now. 
It's  lunch.  "   A  scurry. 

A  voice  thundered  through  the  microphones 
from  the  sound  mixers.    "Was  that  lunch?" 

"Oh,  come  on,  let's  get  the  scene,"  urged 
Lionel  Barrymore. 

"  Certainly,  we'll  get  the  scene, "  announced 
Goulding.  "Everybody  ready?  Miss  Craw- 
ford, please.    Mr.  Jack  Barrymore — " 

Jack  turned  from  the  outside  door.  "I 
thought  you  said  lunch.  Beery's  gone.  Miss 
Crawford  is  changing  her  frock — " 

"Is  it  lunch?"  called  the  cameraman. 

"It  looks  like  it,"  answered  Goulding. 

The  stage  was  empty.  Make-up  boxes, 
musical  instruments,  cocktail  shakers,  glasses, 
cameras,  lights — 

And  as  inanimate  as  any  of  them,  gazing 
stonily  at  the  bottles  of  colored  water  with 
their  enticing  labels,  on  a  high  stool  at  the 
bar — sat  the  Lion  Tamer. 

(T\RBO.  Sitting  on  a  little  box  on  the  edge 
Vjrof  the  lobby  of  the  Grand  Hotel— eating  an 
apple.  Dressed  in  chinchillas.  With  her  eyes 
half-closed.  She  cut  the  apple  into  small  bits 
with  a  knife.  She  would  have  bitten  into  it 
only  it  would  have  spoiled  her  make-up. 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  July,  1932 

She  called:  "L-l-1-1 — n."  Before  she  had 
finished  the  "n"  of  Ellen — Ellen,  black  and 
motherly,  was  at  her  side,  mirror  in  hand. 

The  walls  behind  Garbo  began  to  move. 
She  turned — startled  like  a  deer  in  the  forest. 
She  noticed  for  the  first  time  that  the  wall 
before  which  she  had  squatted  had  wheels. 
The  men  pulled  it  away,  shouted  a  warning. 
Garbo  rose.     Ellen  pulled  away  the  box. 

"What  ees  thees?" 

"It  would  be  safer  over  here,"  answered 
Ellen. 

Suddenly,  from  within  that  moving  wall 
comes  Bing  Crosby's  voice:  "Can't  We  Talk 
It  Over,  Dear?" 

Garbo  jumped,  looked  about  her.  That  ques- 
tion sounded  so  close,  so  near,  that  Garbo 
must  have  wondered  if  the  studio  executives 
had  crept  to  her  side  and  were  singing  an 
invitation  to  talk  over  a  new  contract. 

"CINDING  herself  alone,  Garbo  turned  again 
-*-  to  that  thing  on  wheels.  It  was  like  a  little 
palace!  She  seated  herself  almost  squarely 
before  it.  A  tiny  knocker  on  the  door!  Garbo 
was  fascinated.  "What  ees  thees?"  she  asked 
Ellen. 

"A  dressing-room." 

"Nice,"  answered  Garbo. 

Again  the  miniature  palace  was  moving! 
Workmen  had  to  pass  with  cameras,  etc. 

"Stop!" 

The  workmen  rushed  to  pick  something  from 
the  floor. 

Lionel  Barrymore!  Asleep,  in  his  chair,  he 
had  not  seen  the  approaching  miniature  palace. 
Chair  and  Lionel  had  tumbled  over. 

"D .  Why  couldn't  you  look?"  bel- 
lowed Lionel. 

The  assistant  Lion  Tamer  rushed  to  the 
rescue.  In  a  second  they  were  all  on  their 
knees  searching  anxiously.  Lionel's  moustache 
was  in  his  hand  while  he  was  asleep! 

The  door  of  the  palace  opened.  Joan  looked 
out.  "Ed,"  she  called  to  the  young  man  who 
does  nothing  but  care  for  her  phonograph 
records.     "Put  the  other  piece  on,  dear." 

"Which  other  piece,  Joanie?" 

"You  know,  Ed. " 

"What's  the  scene,  Joanie?" 

"Oh,  kind  of  gay  and  bright. " 

Garbo,  on  her  box,  looked  from  one  to  the 
other  as  the  voices  crossed. 

"What  ees  the  scene,  L-l-1-1 — n?" 

"Just  where  you  walk  through  the  people  in 
the  lobby." 

"Then  it  ees  very  sad,"  answered  Garbo. 

At  that  moment,  Lionel  Barrymore  crawled 
from  beneath  the  palace — with  his  moustache. 

"Hello,  Miss  Garbo.    These  d fools," 

waving  his  moustache  and  looking  around  for 
his  chair. 

The  assistant  Lion  Tamer  rushed  up.  "Onto 
the  set,  Lionel.    Where's  your  hat?" 

"I  don't  know.    Find  it." 


A  BURST  of  laughter  nearby.  Wally  Beery 
■**•  was  telling  the  extras  about  his  airplane. 
Lionel  turned.  He  thought  Beery  was  laugh- 
ing at  him. 

"Who  ees  that  man?  The  beeg  one  with 
the  happy  face?"  asked  Garbo. 

"It's  Wally  Beery,"  answered  Lionel. 

"Oh,"  Garbo  moved  her  box  a  little  to  peep 
better  at  the  man  whom  she  had  never  before 
seen  in  person. 

Across  the  set,  another  burst  of  laughter. 
More  extras.  Jean  Hersholt  at  a  desk.  He 
had  drawn  a  picture  of  Lionel  asleep  in  his 
chair! 

A  voice  came  from  the  sky.  Everyone 
looked  up.  Lion  Tamer  Edmund  Goulding, 
sixty  feet  in  the  air,  on  a  crane — standing  on 
a  thin  steel  edge  with  nothing  between  him 
and  the  floor. 

All  heard  the  cameraman's  voice.  "Care- 
ful.   What  if  you  fell  off?" 

Goulding  glanced  back.  Waved  his  hand — 
as  though  he  might  enjoy  it!  That  tumble 
which  meant  he  would  no  longer  have  to  be 
Lion  Tamer.

ANTI  DOTE 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  Jlly,  1932 

He  called  down.  "Ladies  and  gentlemen, 
you  arc  in  Merlin's  best  hotel.  The  men  do 
not  hold  the  women's  arms  in  Berlin  as  though 
they  were  afraid  of  losing  them.  You  are  not 
in  the  Ambassador.  Men  do  not  put  their 
arms  around  other  men's  shoulders  when  they 
meet.  The  bell  boys  do  not  call  out,  'Hi  y, 
.Mr.  Jones,  you're  wanted  on  the  telephone.' 
They  bow  first,  speak,  and  turn  sharply  away. 
The  reception  clerk  does  not  hold  out  his  hand 
and  greet  a  newcomer.  Have  you  all  got  your 
felt  slippers  on?  The  scene  must  be  absolutely 
silent.  The  only  voices  I  want  to  hear  are 
those  of  Mr.  Stone,  the  two  Barrymores,  Miss 
Crawford  and  Mr.  Hersholt.  Miss  Garbo  will 
be  in  the  scene,  but  she  does  not  speak.  As 
she  passes  through,  glance  at  her.  She  is  a 
great  dancer  leaving  for  the  theater.  Are  you 
ready?    Lock  'em  up.    Start  your  action — " 

And  so  was  started  the  most  expensive  piece 
of  him  in  history.  Six  hundred  feet  of  con- 
secutive film — on  the  same  celluloid.  The 
greatest  actors  of  the  day  intermingled. 

Goulding  climbed  down,  hand  over  hand — 
sixty  feet  of  cold  steel.  He  crept  behind  the 
palace  on  wheels.  Pressed  close  was  Garbo. 
Intense,  silent,  taut  as  the  steel  above  her. 
The  scene  was  in  progress. 

The  door  of  the  palace  opened.  Crawford 
stepped  out — bumped  into,  Garbo. 

"I  beg  your  pardon." 

"All  right.    We  must  be  quiet.  *' 

Garbo  and  Crawford  had  met  at  last. 

THE  assistant  director  ran  about  the  edge  of 
the  set.  "Where's  Lionel?  Where's  Lionel?" 
he  whispered.  A  snore  rewarded  him.  Dorian 
awakened  Lionel  and  pushed  him  onto  the  set. 
Goulding  climbed  back  up  the  steel.  Every- 
thing was  splendid!  A  slim,  self-effacing  little 
fellow  tip  toed  quietly  onto  the  set.  He  smiled 
encouragement  up  at  the  Lion  Tamer,  now  on 
the  very  edge  of  the  thin  rail.  Irving  Thalberg, 
the  young  production  genius,  behind  it  all. 

Four  hundred  feet  of  the  sLx  hundred  were 
completed.  Not  a  break  in  lines !  Xot  a  mistake 
in  the  acting!    Everyone  giving  his  best — 


"D "  called  the  director.     "Cut!    We 

will  have  to  shoot  it  all  over." 

"What's  the  matter?"     It  was  a  chorus. 

•'Where  is  your  moustache,  Lionel?" 

"Somewhere,"  answered  Lionel,  fingering 
his  face  blankly. 

"Did  you  hear  that  whistle?"  whispered  the 
cameraman  up  on  the  crane  with  the  Lion 
Tamer. 

'What  whistle?"  demanded  Goulding. 

"Lunch!"  boomed  Beery  from  beneath. 

"The  twelve  o'clock  whistle,"  answered  the 
cameraman,  pointing  to  Beery. 

Goulding  wiped  his  forehead.  The  set  was 
already  clearing. 

C^  OULDIXG  climbed  down  and  looked  at 
^-^the  vacantness  about  him.  A  thin  stream 
of  smoke  from  beneath  the  palace  on  wheels. 

"The  Grand  Hotel  on  fire,"  he  muttered 
wildly.  He  walked  toward  the  smoke,  behind 
the  palace  on  wheels.  A  lady  in  chinchillas 
was  seated  on  a  box  smoking. 

"Hello,"  said  Garbo. 

"Hello,"  said  Goulding.  "Aren't  you  going 
to  lunch?" 

"Xobody  told  me.'' 

Garbo,  alone,  had  awaited  the  director's 
order. 

"You're  marvelous."  said  Goulding. 

"Why?"  asked  Garbo. 

"Oh,  I  don't  know."  said  Goulding. 

"What  time  back?"  said  Garbo. 

"I'll  send  for  you.    Rest  up." 

"I  like  the  handkerchief  you  wear  around 
your  neck." 

"Here  take  it.  I'll  give  it  to  you,"  said 
Goulding. 

"No.    I  like  to  see  it  on  you.    L-l-1 — n." 

Goulding  watched  her  go,  followed  by  the 
motherly,  black  Ellen.  His  eyes  were  wistful. 
If  everybody  were  like — 

The  Lion  Tamer  started  suddenly.    Ed  had 
found  the  record  for  which  he  had  been  look 
all  morning.    Bing  Crosby's  voice  called  aero 
the  sta<:e  in  his  crooning  best — "I  Surrender, 
Dear."

"Cimarron"  Wins! 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  67  ] 

to  Hollywood  from  the  reservations,  expert 
horsemen  and  cowboys.  Three  thousand  horses 
and  mules  were  used  and  over  a  thousand 
vehicles  of  the  type  seen  before  "  the  horseless 
carriage. " 

At  a  cost  of  $100,000  a  complete  town  was 
constructed,  wherein  most  of  the  action  took 
place.  In  the  midst  of  a  strip  of  California 
desert  country  "Osage,"  Oklahoma,  grew  and 
it  looked  not  like  a  motion  picture  set  but  like 
a  real  "boom"  town  that  springs  up  as  sud- 
denly as  a  prairie  flower  in  the  midst  of  a 
wilderness. 

A  LTHOUGH  there  were  many  trials  during 
-*Mts  filming,  no  one  who  had  anything  at  all 
to  do  with  "Cimarron"  had  any  doubts  of  its 
greatness.  Everyone  connected  with  that  film 
knew  what  it  would  be. 

It  was  Richard  Dix  who  made  the  hero  of 
that  tremendous  story  come  alive.  Dix,  for 
the  many  weeks  that  "Cimarron"  was  in  pro- 
duction, was  Yancey  Cravat.  Known  as  a  good, 
capable  actor,  he  surprised  even  his  best  friends 
by  the  scope  and  power  of  his  characterization. 

Opposite  him,  in  a  role  of  almost  equal  im- 
portance, was  Irene  Dunne  as  the  immortal 
Sabra.  A  newcomer  to  the  screen,  she  proved 
herself  instantly  by  running  the  gamut  of 
emotions  and  growing  from  a  fresh  young  girl 
into  a  self-assured  middle-aged  woman  with  a 
seat  in  Congress  awaiting  her.  Both  she  and 
Dix  aged  over  twenty  years  for  the  purposes 
of  the  story  and  here  credit  must  be  given  to 
Em  Westmore,  who  performed  the  difficult 
make-up  feats  upon  all  the  members  of  the  cast. 

Irene  Dunne  was  not  the  only  one  who  was 
brought  to  fame  by  "  Cimarron. "  The  stutter- 
ing comedian,  Rosco  Ates,  vividly  impressed 
himself  upon  the  minds  of  picturegoers,  as  did 
Edna  May  Oliver.  Both  of  these  became 
featured  players  of  high  standing  upon  the 
release  of  "  Cimarron.  " 

Estelle  Taylor  did  the  best  work  of  her 
career,  as  the  luscious  Dixie  Lee;  George  E. 
Stone  contributed  moments  of  sheer  beauty,  in 
fact  every  member  of  that  long  list  of  notables 
— including  Nance  O'Neil,  William  Collier,  Jr., 
and  others  too  numerous  to  mention — deserve 
special  notice.  There  were  twenty-nine  princi- 
pal players  in  that  remarkable  cast. 

And  the  beauty  of  Eddie  Cronjager's  camera 
work  remains  a  high  spot  in  motion  picture 
history. 

"Cimarron"  is  a  living  proof  that  any  great 
story  can  be  made  into  a  great  film  when  there 
is  unity  of  purpose  and  complete  harmony 
between  company,  director,  writer,  actors  and 
working  staff. 

TN  a  year  when  many  remarkable  pictures 
-'■were  released  it  is  a  great  tribute  that "  Cimar- 
ron" should  have  received  the  largest  number 
of  votes,  from  the  thousands  of  votes  that 
reached  Photoplay's  offices  from  almost  every 
country  in  the  civilized  world. 

A  word  of  explanation  must  be  made  about 
why  the  1931  award  is  not  made  until  the 
middle  of  1932. 

This  is  so  that  people  throughout  the  world 
may  have  a  chance  to  see  all  the  films  released 
in  1931,  and  have  a  chance  to  make  their 
selection.  And  the  responses  have  come  from 
all  parts  of  the  world,  from  people  of  all  races, 
for  although  "  Cimarron  "  was  a  story  of  Ameri- 
can pioneer  life,  its  theme  was  universal. 

The  Photoplay  medal  which  will  go  to 
Radio  Pictures  is  solid  gold,  weighing  123}^ 
pennyweights,  and  is  two  and  a  half  inches  in 
diameter.  It  is  designed  and  executed  by 
Tiffany  and  Company  of  New  York. 

Photoplay — acting  as  the  representative  of 
thousands  of  picturegoers — salutes  Radio  Pic- 
tures and  all  of  the  many  who  were  responsible 
for  giving  "Cimarron"  to  the  world!

Don't  Call  Him  "Skippy 


[  CONTINUED  FHOM  PACE  56  ] 


hands  hanging  limply  at  their  sides  would  do 
well  to  follow  Jackie  around  for  a  few  days. 
They  could  learn  a  lot  about  the  fundamentals 
of  dramatic  expression. 

Since  he  became  an  overnight  sensation, 
Cooper  has  acquired  certain  habits  of  living  as 
befits  a  gentleman  of  affairs.  Of  course  there 
is  a  lot  of  entertaining  to  do,  and  since  mother 
dear  is  fearful  lest  Jackie's  wild  "Hollywood 
parties"  wreck  their  home,  he  has  betaken 
himself  to  the  back  yard  where  he  and  his  gang 
have  erected  a  club  house  in  which  to  entertain 
Jackie's  important  friends  from  the  studio. 

'"THERE  is  an  improvised  stove  for  cooking 
*■  a  bachelor  supper  and  a  few  chairs  so  that 
everybody  doesn't  have  to  sit  on  the  floor.  One 
of  the  studio  officials  told  me  that  an  invitation 
to  Jackie's  club  is  a  mark  of  distinction  at 
M-G-M.  Jackie  is  thinking  of  hiring  a  park- 
ing lot  for  the  really  big  occasions  so  his  guests 
won't  clutter  up  the  street  in  front  of  his  modest 
home  with  their  limousines  and  maybe  get 
pinched. 

As  Jackie  has  discovered,  even  a  kid  star 
isn't  immune  to  the  multitudinous  perplexities 
that  swarm  toward  outstanding  picture  per- 
sonalities like  steel  filings  to  a  magnet. 

Seeing  in  me  an  emissary  from  the  million 
or  more  picture  devotees  who  read  Photoplay, 
Jackie  took  the  opportunity  to  give  me  some 
very  confidential  messages  to  "  tell  'em. " 

Sticking  out  his  famous  underlip,  he  leaned 
against  the  table  and  looked  up  at  me  with 
thoughtful  deliberation.  "You  tell  'em,"  he 
began,  "that  I  never  sassed  a  lady  reporter 
like  somebody  said  I  did,  will  ya?  No  sir! 
The  only  time  I  ever  sassed  anybody  was  once 
when  my  gang  was  fighting  some  kids,  but  I 
never  did  sass  any  grown-up  people  at  all,  I 
didn't.    No  sir.    You'll  tell  'em  that  won'tcha?" 

You  bet  I'll  tell  'em,  right  here  and  now.  If 
anybody  wants  to  know  the  truth  about  this 
"sassing  lady  reporter"  business,  all  they  have 
to  do  is  read  what  the  lady  herself  said  about 
it.  It  seems  that  some  eavesdropping  chatter 
writer  overheard  one  of  Jackie's  quick-witted 
replies  to  said  lady  reporter  and  construed  same 
as  being  a  bit  too  sophisticated  for  one  of 
Jackie's  years. 

Now  if  there  is  anything,  outside  of  Greta 
Garbo's  unaccountable  seclusion  that  would 
create  a  furor  in  Hollywood,  it  would  be  for 
Jackie  Cooper,  the  most  natural  actor  on  the 
screen,  to  start  "putting  it  on.  " 


To  quote  the  lady  reporter  exactly,  his  reply 
was  "not  sassy  at  all,  but  a  boyish  wisecrack 
that  any  small  boy  in  the  country  might  be 
guilty  of  letting  slip  occasionally."  What  do 
they  expect  anyway,  little  Lord  Fauntleroy? 

Outside  of  that  there  is  another  thing  that 
has  Jackie  worried.  "Why  is  it,"  Jackie  in- 
quired mournfully,  "why  has  everybody  got 
to  call  me  Skippy  all  the  time?  I  was  Midge 
too  wasn't  I,  and  they  could  call  me  Dink. 
Wally  Beery  called  me  Dink  all  the  time  when 
we  were  playing  in  'The  Champ,'  "  he  added 
happily.  "  I  s'pose  even  after  I'm  Limpy  they'll 
still  want  to  call  me  Skippy — it's  tur'ble. " 

Jackie  has  been  thrown  in  contact  with  a 
great  many  grown  people  since  signing  his  con- 
tract at  M-G-M.  Outside  of  the  fact  that  he 
has  been  co-starred  with  actors  like  Wally 
Beery  and  Chic  Sale,  he  has  been  paling  around 
a  lot  with  Mr.  Mayer,  his  boss,  and  when 
Kermit  Roosevelt  came  to  visit  the  studio  it 
was  none  other  than  Jackie  who  was  selected 
to  show  him  around. 

It  is  surprising  that  Jackie  has  been  able  to 
maintain  his  boyish  naivete  in  the  face  of  such 
mature  influences.  The  men  who  are  Jackie's 
pals  put  aside  their  adult  dignity  and  become 
kids  again  when  they  talk  things  over  with 
him,  for  there  is  something  altogether  whole- 
some and  respectful  in  the  way  J.  C.  calls  all 
his  friends  by  their  first  names.  Nothing 
smarty  about  it  at  all.  It  reminds  you  of  the 
way  Theodore  Roosevelt's  children  always 
called  their  father  T.  R. 

When  Jackie  gets  to  Washington,  D.C.,  on 
his  personal  appearance  tour,  he  has  heard  that 
Mr.  Hoover  plans  to  invite  him  out  to  his 
house  for  supper. 

"That'll  be  keen,"  observed  Jackie. 

TT  is  altogether  probable  that  Jackie  will 
■J  wave  his  hand  through  the  air  as  H.  H.  comes 
down  the  Grand  Staircase. 

"Hi,  Herb,"  he  will  no  doubt  say  as  he  lets 
loose  with  one  of  those  "spontaneous  combus- 
tion" smiles. 

Will  the  President  be  ruffled? 

I  hardly  think  so. 

H.  H.  will  no  doubt  wave  his  hand  in  a  flip- 
pant manner  and  reply, 

"Hi,  Jackie,  how's  the  boy?" 

Inside  of  five  minutes  I'll  bet  they'll  be  sit- 
ting on  the  White  House  carpet  playing  marbles 
with  some  of  Jackie's  swell  agates  that  he  car- 
ries around  with  him. 


An  Extra  Girl's  Diaiy 


CONTINUED  FROM  P.U;L   74  ] 


"Perhaps  I  am  too  critical,  but  I  think  he 
did  too  much  crying." 

Well,  days  passed.  The  Fairbanks  interview 
resulted  in  a  test.  But  the  diary  tells  of  many 
tests — each  given  Ann  through  her  mother's 
"pull" — and  none  of  which  resulted  in  work. 
She  never  got  a  job  as  a  result  of  the  Fairbanks 
test. 

Ann  thought  things  out.  Perhaps,  she  rea- 
soned, her  mother's  influence  was  a  handicap, 
not  an  asset.  She  tried  on  her  own.  She  learned 
of  a  call  for  dancers  for  the  big  musical  Metro- 
Goldwyn-Mayer  was  to  make — "The  Holly- 
wood Revue. "  Just  one  of  hundreds  of  other 
girls,  she  answered  the  call — as  Ann  Dvorak. 
The  people  to  whom  she  went  did  not  know 
her;  she  was  just  another  extra  girl  to  them. 
At  Metro  studios  she  took  a  test  .... 

Her  diary: 

"Jan.  9 — The  casting  man  at  M-G-M  said 


the  test  wras  not  so  good.  That's  lovely  and 
encouraging!" 

"Jan.  12 — Took  a  test  at  Lasky's.  Saw  it. 
It  was  wonderful.  From  the  depths  to  the 
heights!" 

"Jan.  16 — Got  my  test  from  Lasky's,  took 
it  to  M-G-M.  I  think  it  will  get  me  work 
somewhere.    I  must  persevere.  " 

"Jan.  17 — Home  all  day.  Mr.  D.  at  Lasky's 
said  he  thought  he  would  have  a  call  for  me 
cither  tonight  or  tomorrow.  Musi  be  to- 
morrow!" 

"Jan.  18 — Well,  my  'good'  luck  was  with 
me,  as  usual.  Our  phone  was  out  of  order,  so 
Mr.  D.  couldn't  get  me!  No  use  being  down- 
cast and  all  that  rot.  I'll  make  these  studios 
or  bust!  Took  my  test  to  Sam  W.  at  M-G-M." 

"Jan.  21 — Took  my  test  to  Fred  N.  at 
M-G-M.  I  simply  must  succeed.  I  refuse  to 
be  squelched." 


All  through  these  days  the  diary  tells  of 
financial  troubles  at  home.  Tells  of  despera- 
tion, in  the  hunt  for  a  job.  "We  sadly  need 
the  money,"  it  reads;  "people  are  so  hard- 
boiled!'"  Then  came  a  break.  At  M-G-M 
she  saw  an  assistant  producer — and: 

" .  .  .  he  is  very  kind,  but  a  little  fresh.  He 
says  he  will  put  me  in  his  new  revue.  If  he 
does,  great!  He  had  me  waiting  around  all  day, 
doing  nothing.  And  he  has  the  nerve  to  be 
fresh,  too!" 

MORE  days  of  waiting  followed.  More  finan- 
cial worries- — intimate  things  that  a  girl  tells 
her  diary,  that  cannot  be  printed  here;  things 
about  home  troubles,  needs.  "Good  Lord,  I 
simply  must  get  work.  I  hate  money,  but  one 
must  have  it  .  .  ." 

Then  came  the  call  from  the  assistant  pro- 
ducer— he  had  kept  his  promise,  fresh  though 
he  had  been! 

February'  4.  the  diary  says: 

"Well,  I  got  my  fill  of  activity  today.  Re- 
hearsed on  the  set.  What  work!  Dead!  Never 
did  soft-shoe  before. " 

"Feb.  5 — This  work  is  a  lot  of  fun,  even  if 
it  is  frantically  hard.    Tired." 

"Feb.  6— Well,  I'm  all  set  for  the  job.  But, 
how  tired  I  am!  My  leg  muscles  are  stiff. 
Don't  know  how  I'll  get  through  those  routines 
tomorrow. " 

"Feb.  7 — I  can  hardly  walk,  I'm  so  stiff, 
but  I'm  certainly  glad  I'm  working.  Funny, 
how  work  comes  just  when  I'm  about  to  go 
mad  for  idleness. " 

"  Feb.  9 — I  had  the  pleasure  of  giving  mother 
S3 7. 50  tonight.  Hurrah!  I'm  actually  earning 
some  money.    It's  about  time  I  did  that.  " 

Then  came  sickness — ten  days  in  bed,  with 
flu.  The  diary  voices  her  worry  that  it  will 
halt  the  work  she  had  just  started.  But  luck 
was  with  her. 

When  she  was  well  she  went  back  to  the 
studio;  she  still  had  the  job. 

"...  people  at  the  studio  are  very  strange. 
One  day  they  are  smiling  and  friendly.  The 
next  they  are  cold  and  distant. " 

Days  tell  of  the  routine  of  work.  The  fun 
she  spoke  of  earlier  was  gone,  now.  Work  had 
taken  its  place.  Now  and  then  she  laughed  at 
herself : 

"Every  time  I  smoke  a  cigarette  I  get  sick, 
and  yet  every  once  in  a  while  I  do  it.  I  must 
have  an  idea  I  look  cute  or  something  when  I 
smoke.    I'm  so  dumb. " 

On  a  day  just  after  that,  she  spoke  to  a  star 
— her  first  big  thrill.  "  Spoke  to  Joan  Crawford 
today,  and  she  is  a  very  sweet  girl,"  is  all  the 
diary  tells.  But  what  a  wealth  of  experience 
behind  those  words — the  sole  entry  in  that 
day's  space — the  big  event  of  that  day  for  the 
little  extra  girl. 

She  spoke  to  Joan  Crawford! 

Then  come  days  and  days  and  days  of  work 
— hard  work,  from  nine  to  five  each  day,  home 
and  in  bed  by  nine-thirty,  dog  tired.  But  at 
last  the  picture  was  ended;  Ann  Dvorak's  first 
movie  job  was  over  .  .  .  "tonight  the  produc- 
tion closed.  All  the  boys  and  girls  felt  rather 
sad  about  leaving  after  being  together  all  of 
every  day  for  eleven  weeks.  I  certainly  do.  It 
has  meant  the  beginning  of  everything  to  me. 
A  good  part  of  my  self-consciousness  has  left 
me,  and  I  feel  more  at  ease  among  people. 
Well,  that's  that.  Now  for  more  work — and 
more." 

The  next  day".  .  .  that  heavy  '  failure' feel- 
ing came  over  me  today;  I  woke  and  started  to 
dress  for  work — and  then  I  realized  that  it  is 


"DUT  several  days  later,  they  called  her  again 
■'-' — for  another  musical.  That's  what  they  were 
making  in  those  days.  She  wrote  of  the 
"college  capers"  step  that  created  a  sensation 
in  one  of  the  M-G-M  musicals. 

"  It  took  them  nearly  two  weeks  of  hard  re- 
hearsing to  get  the  scene  the  way  they  wanted 
it,"  she  wrote. 

"  I  really  love  studios,  and  everyone  there.  I 
know  they  don't  realize  how  much  I  appreciate 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  July,  1932 

the  chances  they  have  been  giving  me.  I  love 
it  and  hope  I  can  get  a  little  part  of  some  kind 
soon.  O,  God,  please  give  me  the  courage  to 
keep  up  the  right  spirit  towards  my  work.  I 
don't  mean  that  I'm  not  still  ambitious  about 
it,  but  I  mean  that  I  don't  want  to  fall  into  the 
mental  rut  that  so  many  do  who  find  them- 
selves still  on  the  'small  end'  of  the  profession. 
I  want  to  start  at  the  bottom.  In  fact,  I'd 
rather.  Anyway,  I  have  to.  But  I  want  to 
keep  myself  good — and  intelligent  and  alert, 
most  of  all. 

"\\  7AITING  around  on  a  set  is  demoraliz- 

W  ing  in  every  way.  People  just  sit  around 
and  look  at  each  other.  There  is  positively  no 
mental  work  at  all.  But  I'm  trying  to  keep  my 
head  above  water.  I  know  that  what  I'm  doing 
now  is  moulding  my  future  career,  but  oh  gosh, 
it's  hard!" 

Days  of  idleness  again — chafing  at  inactivity. 
Then  a  new  call.  "I'll  be  glad  to  get  to  work 
again.  I  can't  stand  sitting  around.  That's 
all  I  can  do,  you  know,  because  mother  won't 
let  me  go  anywhere.  She  is  worried  that  I'll  be 
around  too  sophisticated  a  crowd.  I  get  so 
tired  of  seeing  this  house  and  I'd  give  a«  vthing 
for  a  nice  dance  floor  and  a  good  dancing 
partner.  Pretty  soon  I'll  forget  what  it  is  like 
to  go  out  and  I  won't  care.  If  it  weren't  for  my 
work,  I'd  go  insane  —  that  comes  from  my 
heart,  too." 

Discouragement  rode  her  as  the  weeks  went 
by,  and  no  contract  came,  as  she  had  hoped. 
"I  suppose  if  they  ever  do  sign  me,  it  will  be 
merely  along  with  the  rest  of  the  chorus,  just  as 
a  dancing  girl.  I'm  not  so  good  as  I  thought  I 
was.  But  that,  too,  is  part  of  the  game.  I'll 
stick  to  it  like  an  octopus  until,  finally,  in  my 
old  age  they'll  take  pity  and  sign  me  for  a  char- 
acter woman.  But  there  I  go,  mooning  with 
self-pity!  I'll  just  keep  working  and  remember 
that  one  can  never  hold  a  job  too  small — that 
is,  if  we  aren't  satisfied  or  capable  of  doing  little 
things,  if  we  aren't  big  enough  to  do  little 
things,  we  certainly  aren't  big  enough  to  do  big 
things.  And  then,  too,  a  ladder  must  be 
climbed,  not  flown." 

Soon  afterward  came  the  big  event — her 
first  premiere.  With  her  mother,  once  a  star, 
Ann  went  to  Grauman's  Chinese  Theater,  to 
the  opening  of  "The  Hollywood  Revue."  Her 
sky-high  heart,  though,  must  have  been 
crushed  to  earth;  she  and  her  mother  were 
ignored,  apparently.    Anyway,  she  wrote: 

"...  I  felt  terribly  small  and  inconsequen- 
tial among  all  those  stars.  Mother  looked 
lovely,  but  I  felt  sorry  that  more  people  did  not 
take  notice  of  her.  She  certainly  looked  much 
prettier  than  anyone  else  that  I  saw.  People 
are  very,  very  cruel  when  they  have  success, 
and  God  forbid  that  I  ever  get  that  way  when 
I  succeed! 

"Just  from  a  thing  like  last  night  I  can 
realize  how  far  at  the  foot  of  the  ladder  I  am, 
and  what  a  long  climb  there  is  ahead  of  me. 
And  it  hurts,  too,  being  a  chorus  girl,  and 
branded  as  such.  Not  that  I  don't  like  danc- 
ing. It's  just  the  undignified  something  about 
it.  It  sort  of  keeps  you  from  doing  anything 
else.  But  I  will,  anyway — and  just  let  some- 
one try  to  stop  me! 

"And  when  I  reach  the  top,  I  won't  be  high- 
hat  like  all  the  rest.  I'd  rather  die.  Even  if 
there  are  people  I'm  not  interested  in,  I  won't 
hurt  them  by  letting  them  know  it." 

"pROM  then  on,  the  diary  tells  comparatively 
*-  little.  Ann  Dvorak  was  working — and  work- 
ing hard.  It  left  no  time  for  writing  her  heart's 
thoughts  on  paper.  Oh,  now  and  then  there's 
a  note,  apologetic  in  tone,  for  neglect  of  the 
diary.  Or,  now  and  then,  one  of  those  intro- 
spective passages  that  girls  confide  to  their 
diaries.    Like: 

"I  don't  think  about  God  much.  I  try  to 
put  all  my  faith  in  myself.  My  God,  if  I  have 
one,  is  beauty  and  love  and  music  combined. 
Everything  is  beautiful,  even  what  we  call 
ugliness.  If  a  mountain  is  beautiful,  one  can't 
say  it  is  partly  ugly  because  it  is  made  of  dirt,

Ann  worked.  Many  months,  she  stayed  at 
M-G-M — where  she  did  get  a  contract — but 
only  as  a  dancing  girl;  later  as  dancing  in- 
structress. It  was  not  what  she  sought,  so 
every  time  she  had  a  chance,  she  took  tests  for 
roles,  elsewhere.  One  day,  Karen  Morley, 
M-G-M's  blonde  future  star,  who  had  been 
borrowed  by  Millionaire  Producer  Howard 
Hughes  for  a  role  in  "Scarface,"  told  Ann  that 
she  might  get  the  part  of  Cesca,  sister  to 
Scarface,  in  the  fdm. 

Ann  took  the  test. 

Somehow,  of  all  the  girls  Hughes  had  tried 
out,  Ann  clicked.  She  got  the  part.  It's  her 
last  entry  in  the  diary: 

"July  8,  1931 — Although  I  haven't  bothered 
to  write  in  such  a  childish  thing  as  a  diary  for  a 
long  time,  I  feel  as  though  this  is  one  of  the  big 
thrill  days  of  my  life!  After  several  days  of 
agonizing  suspense,  I  have  a  lovely,  grand  part 
in  Howard  Hughes'  'Scarface.'  Little  Karen 
Morley  was  responsible  to  a  great  degree  for 
the  whole  thing.  I'm  too  happy  to  think 
clearly.    It's  my  first  part.  .  .  ." 

Y\  7ELL,  when  you  see  "Scarface,"  you'll 
**  know  Ann  Dvorak  made  good.  So  good, 
in  fact,  that  one  day  Howard  Hughes,  having 
seen  some  "rushes."  met  her  in  the  hallway. 
In  his  characteristic  casual  manner,  he  said: 

"Hello." 

She  smiled  back. 

"How'd  you  like  a  contract?" 

•Swell." 

"Okay,  you're  all  set." 

Surprised,  all  Ann  could  say  was:  "  Don't  kid 
me." 

The  millionaire  smiled.  "I'm  not  kidding," 
he  said.  She  started  to  cry.  Today,  Ann's 
under  a  long  term  contract  to  Hughes  and 
Hollywood's  star-pickers  have  put  her  in  that 
little  handful  who,  they  say,  are  destined  for 
stardom. 

"It's  what  I  want;  it's  what  I've  worked 
for,"  she  says.  "I'm  going  to  keep  on  working 
for  it.  And  always,  I'll  remember  the  biggest 
lesson  I've  learned  in  Hollywood — that  is: 
'  Keep  Your  Head.'  That  means  keep  it  when 
you're  down,  and  keep  it  even  more  when 
you're  going  up."

Marian  &  Janet 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  73  ] 

in  "  7th  Heaven."  And  Borzage  informed  the 
Fox  studio  officials — as  if  they  couldn't  see  it 
for  themselves — that  Marian  has  the  same 
wistful  appeal  that  Janet  has,  the  same  whimsy 
that  has  been  making  money  clink  at  Fox  box- 
offices  for  the  last  six  years. 

Marian  proved  herself  in  "After  Tomorrow." 
And  as  I  saw  that  film,  I  thought  to  myself, 
''The  real  Marian  Xixon  has  at  last  reached 
the  screen;  she  has  forgotten  that  weekly  pay 
check."  It  was  a  big  jump  in  salary,  you 
recall,  that  lured  her  away  from  Fox  to  sign 
with  Universal,  even  when  "7th  Heaven"  had 
been  promised  her.  Alike  as  Janet  and  Marian 
are  on  the  screen,  strangely  as  have  their  careers 
tangled  in  the  web  of  Hollywood,  they  are 
entirely  different  personalities. 

TN  the  early  days  Janet's  dreams  of  the 
-Muture  were  ephemeral,  nebulous  air  castles. 
Marian  did  not  dream — she  planned.  Janet 
indulged  in  visions,  Marian  in  cold  fact.  Janet 
visualized  herself  as  a  great  dramatic  actress 
on  the  screen;  Marian  spoke  of  collecting  an 
impressive  weekly  salary  check.  Perhaps  it 
was  that  which  shot  Janet  to  the  top  so  sud- 
denly and  made  Marian  wait  for  her  chance, 
for  now  that  she  has  plenty  of  money,  she  can 
throw  herself  into  her  characterizations  merely 
because  she  loves  her  work. 

Don't  get  the  idea  that  Marian  is  mercenary 
— she  is  one  of  the  most  generous  girls  I've 
ever  known.  But  she  is  a  clever  business 
woman,  which  Janet  is  not,  and  the  difference 
somehow  seemed  to  register  before  the  camera 
for  all  those  years. 

Marian  has  always  been  more  the  woman 
and  Janet  the  child.  Janet  loves  trips  to  the 
beach  piers,  wild  rides  on  the  merry-go-rounds, 
thrilling,  mad  excursions  on  the  shoot-the-dips, 
while  Marian  prefers  the  theater  and  the  opera. 
Janet  can  work  herself  into  a  lather  over  the 
prospect  of  a  weinie  bake,  while  Marian  likes 
the  smart  Mayfair  dances  best.  Yet  Marian 
can  enjoy  herself  at  the  beach,  too,  while  Janet 
is  usually  at  the  Mayfair  parties.  It  is  because 
I  know  both  girls  so  well  that  I  find  the  differ- 
ences in  them.  The  casual  observer  would 
think  them  remarkably  alike. 

Marian  is  probably  a  wealthier  woman  than 
Janet — despite  Marian's  bad  picture  breaks 
and  Janet's  good  luck,  yet  of  the  two  Marian 
has  experienced  more  of  life's  actualities,  while 
Janet  has  lived  in  a  world  of  fancy.  Marian 
has  been  married  twice — once  to  a  boxer,  Joe 
Benjamin,  and  now  to  Eddie  Hillman,  a  multi- 
millionaire. Janet,  despite  her  rumored  engage- 
ments, has  married  but  once. 

They  are  great  friends  and  have  remained 
so  through  the  years.  Certainly  each  owes  the 
other  a  debt  of  gratitude  for  this  strange  inter- 
change of  roles — the  one  bringing  Janet  to  the 
top  with  a  bang  and  the  other  giving  Marian 
a  belated  spot  among  the  film  mighty. 

CO  there  they  are — so  much  alike  in  film  type 
k-' — working  together  on  the  same  lot.  Again 
Marian  has  fallen  heir  to  one  of  Janet's  roles — 
that  of  "Rebecca  of  Sunnybrook  Farm."  I 
wonder  what  Fate  has  in  store  for  them  now? 
Will  Marian  fare  as  well  as  Janet  has?  Will 
Janet,  who  photographs  more  beautiful  than 
she  is,  find  her  reign  disputed  by  Marian,  who 
is  more  beautiful  than  she  photographs?  As 
Janet's  friend,  I'd  advise  her  to  look  to  her 
laurels.  This  Xixon  kid  has  a  lot  of  the  stuff 
that  Janet  has,  and  while  Janet  is  pining  to 
be  a  great  actress,  Marian,  who  is  just  getting 
her  stride,  is  content  with  being  sweet  and 
charming  and  very  much  what  the  public 
wants  just  at  the  moment. 

So  there  you  have  the  strange  and  tangled 
story.  It  has  already  afforded  me  many  a  long 
winter's  evening  of  meditation  thinking  what 
would  have  happened  if  .  .  .

Juanita 
Hansen 


"pIFTEEN  years  ago  we 
*-  devoted  eight  pages  to 
pictures  of  beautiful  girls 
wearing  the  last  word  in 
1917  bathing  suits.  And 
you  should  see  some  of 
those  models!  — Juanita 
Hansen  in  a  nifty  little 
striped  number  that  came 
clear  down  to  her  knees; 
Alary  MacLaren  in  black 
taffeta;  Bessie  Love,  Marie  Prevost  and  Betty 
Compson  all  decked  out  in  full  skirts,  shoes 
and  stockings. 

An  astrologer  predicted  that  Bill  Hart  would 
hold  public  office  and  make  a  great  success  of 
it  and  that  Blanche  Sweet  would  have  "unex- 
pected good  fortune  under  strange  and  peculiar 
circumstances."  Bill's  lonely  life  on  his  ranch 
is  a  far  cry  from  the  life  of  a  statesman,  and 
Blanche  has  had  plenty  of  bad  luck  for  several 
years. 

We  asked  the  question,  "Can  a  pretty  girl 
without  experience  get  a  break  in  pictures?" 
and  our  answer,  in  an  article  that  covered 


several  pages,  was  mostly  "  No."  Vessir,  it  we 
almost  as  hard  to  crash  the  gates  of  Hollywoc 
in  those  days  as  it  is  now  and  the  chances  then 
as  they  are  now  were  about  10,000  to  one.  But 
that  one  chance  is  what  has  given  hope 
thousands  of  girls  for  the  last  fifteen  years. 

Emmy  Wehien  (do  you  remember  her?j  was 
the  girl  on  the  cover,  and  the  gallery  pictures 
were  Ollie  Kirby,  Harry  Morey,  Dorothy 
Phillips  (her  daughter  is  seventeen  years  old 
now),  Elmer  Clifton,  Dorothy  Kelly,  Jack  Mul- 
hall,  Madge  Kennedy  and  June  Elvidge. 

Pictures  reviewed  included  Doug  Fairbanks' 
"In  Again — Out  Again,"  Clara  Kimball 
Young's  "The  Easiest  Way,"  Marguerite 
Clarke's  "The  Valentine  Girl,"  Pauline  Fred- 
erick's "Sleeping  Fires"  and  Charles  Ray's

-L-^BANKS  was  deep  in 
the  filming  of  "Robin 
Hood,"   the  picture  that 
was  to  win  a  Photoplay 
Gold  Medal.    Everybody 
knew  it  would  be  a  great 
picture — and  it  was.  Now, 
Doug  has  recently  re- 
turned from  the  South 
Seas  where  he  dashed  off  a 
new  movie,  and  they  say  he  has  another  great 
picture,  one  that  will  make  you  recall  the  excit- 
ing and  glamorous  "Robin  Hood." 

Nita  Naldi  was  the  rave  ten  years  ago — a 
dark,  seductive  siren  whom  men  adored  and 
women  feared.  Retired  from  the  screen,  La 
Naldi  now  lives  in  New  York  and  her  bon  mots 
— many  of  them  barbed — are  quoted  up  and 
down  Broadway  by  friends.  Nita,  for  all  her 
serious  gaze,  was  and  is  one  of  the  real  wits. 

Lew  Cody  was  begging  the  public  to  forget 
that  an  overzealous  press  agent  had  once  called 
him  a  male  vampire,  for  that  unhappy  phrase 
almost  cost  Lew  his  career.    It  did  keep  him  off 


10  Years  Ago 


the  screen  for  years.  Ten  years  ago  no  director 
would  have  given  him  a  comedy  role. 

Samaniegos,  first  name  Ramon,  wouldn't  fit 
into  electric  lights,  so  director  Rex  Ingram  sug- 
gested Novarro.  And  for  ten  years  Ramon 
Novarro  has  been  a  star. 

There  were  beautiful  pictures  of  Harold 
Lloyd's  palatial  home  and  we  commented, 
"Seems  a  shame  to  waste  all  this  on  a  mere 
bachelor."  Harold  took  the  hint  and  got 
married.  Mildred  Davis  Lloyd  is  still  mistress 
of  the  manse. 

That  world-famous  portrait  of  Rudolph 
Valentino  appeared  on  our  cover.  In  the  gal- 
lery were  Lila  Lee  (now  staging  a  comeback), 
Harold  Lloyd,  Rubye  de  Remer,  Priscilla  Dean, 
Gloria  Swanson  and  Helen  Ferguson. 

The  six  best  films  were  "Grandma's  Boy," 
"Sherlock  Holmes,"  "Prisoner  of  Zenda,"  "The 
Good  Provider,"  "The  Primitive  Lover"  and 
"The  Bachelor  Daddy."

CLARA  BOW  was  rid- 
ing   the   crest   of   the 
popularity  wave  five  years 
ago  and  Elinor  Glyn  had 
just  made  the  decision  that 
Clara  had   "It."     If,   at 
that    time,    Clara    could 
have  looked  into  the  fu- 
ture, she  would  not  have 
believed  what  lay  in  store 
for    her — the    trials,    the 
heartaches,    the    spectacular   gestures,  all  of 
which  have  culminated  in  the  most  amazing 
real  life  story  ever  told,  "Clara  Bow— House- 
wife of  Rancho  Clarito,"  which  you  will  rind 
on  another  page  of  this  magazine. 

Very  proudly  we  published  the  first  photo-

Dick  Arlen  in  their  new  home.  The  house  is

Lionel  Barrymore's  crack  about  the  movies 
not  getting  anywhere,  we  remarked,  "Neither

now  look  at  him! 

And  we  wrote  a  very  gay  item  about  Lya  de 
Putti  putting  ten  fur  coats  into  storage  for  the 
summer.  There  were  a  chinchilla  and  three 
ermines  among  them.  When  she  died  recently 
she  left  behind  nothing  of  worldly  riches. 

And,  of  course,  it  wouldn't  be  a  complete

Five  years  ago  Garbo  was  having  trouble  with

SWING  HIGH 
M-G-M 
Here  is  one  of  the  most  fascinating  shorts 
ever  made  and  if  you  have  held  your  breath 
watching  circus  acrobats  perform  at  the  top  of 
the  big  tent,  you  mustn't  miss  it.  Those  amaz- 
ing aerialists,  the  Codonas,  show  in  close-up 
and  slow  motion  shots  just  how  their  tricks  are 
done,  beginning  with  their  intensive  training. 
Marvelous ! 

EXTRA!  EXTRA! 
RKO-Pathc 
That  lad  Frank  McHugh  is  a  grand  comedian 
and  he  is  at  his  funniest  best  in  this  little  news- 
paper story  about  a  tipsy  reporter  who  stum- 
bles upon  a  big  scoop  at  a  fake  spiritualist 
meeting.    You'll  enjoy  this. 

MILADY'S  ESCAPADE 

Kendall-De  V ally-Educational 

A  musical  episode  suggested  by  the  opera 
"Martha."  Beautiful  voices,  together  with 
quaint  costuming,  make  a  pleasing  and  colorful 
picture.  If  you  aren't  familiar  with  the  opera 
the  story  is  rather  difficult  to  follow. 

PERFECT  CONTROL 

Universal 
Here's  Babe  Ruth — the  Babe  himself — 
showing  all  the  kids  and  grown-ups,  too,  if 
they  care  to  watch,  how  to  throw  a  fast  one-,  a 
curve  or  a  knuckle  ball.  The  information  is  set 
in  the  frame  of  a  nice  little  comedy. 

THE  PROWLERS 

Lyman  Howe -Educational 

One  of  the  "Hodge  Podge"  series  consisting 
of  shots  of  a  native  hunter  in  the  wilds  of 
Africa.  Not  very  exciting  scenes  and  only  three 
or  four  animals  shown. 

A  SLIP  AT  THE  SWITCH 

Radio  Pictures 
A  swift  little  comedy  with  Chic  Sale  in  his 
usual  role  of  the  small  town  hick.    This  time  he 


gets  involved,  hilariously,  with  a  couple  of  rail- 
road bandits  and  gives  chase  in  a  handcar. 
Swell  fun. 

TORCH Y  RAISES  THE  A  UNTIE 

Educational-  Torchy 
Torcky  doesn't  quite  make  the  grade  in  this 
one.  Squiring  two  prudish  aunts  about  to  the 
hot  spots  where  they  succumb  to  the  influence 
of  weird  concoctions,  does  not  offer  him  very 
much  opportunity.  Dorothy  Dix  is,  as  usual, 
a  pretty  little  minx. 

HELP  MA  TES 
Hal  Roach-M-G-M 
There  have  been  funnier  Laurel  and  Hardy 
numbers  than  this  one,  but  in  spite  of  that  this 
short  has  its  moments.  It  all  takes  place  in  a 
kitchen  where  Laurel  aids  Hardy  in  cleaning  up 
a  mess  left  from  a  wild  party  before  Hardy's 
wife  gets  back  home. 

KEEP  COOL 

Talking  Picture  Epics 
Just  shut  your  ears  to  the  attempted  wise- 
cracks made  by  the  feminine  narrator  and 
enjoy  the  beauty  and  charm  of  a  group  of 
children  romping  in  the  snow  at  St.  Moritz. 
Grand  photography. 

HOLLYWOOD  LIGHTS 

Ideal-Educational 
A  passive  comedy  without  many  laughs. 
Rita  Flynn  and  her  acrobatic  legs  do  most  of 
the  work.  It  tells  the  story  of  the  experiences 
of  three  girls  in  their  search  for  employment  at 
the  movie  studios. 

DIVORCE  A  LA   MODE 

Mack  Scnnett-Educational 
Solemn-faced  Raymond  Hatton  all  snarled 
up  in  the  divorce  racket.  And  all  because  bis 
wife's  French  poodle  had  to  have  his  bath  on 
Thursdays.  The  snarl  untangles  after  much 
mixing  up  of  husbands  and  wives,  and  they 
really  didn't  want  divorces,  anyway.  Enter- 
taining.

Vilma  Banky  would  like  to  come  back  to  pictures.    But  being  a  good 
wife  to  Rod  is  more  important.     Certainly  she  is  just  as  beautiful  as  ever 


Vilma  &  Rod 


COXTIXUED  FROM  PAGE  35 


The  same  drapes;  chairs;  occasional  tables. 
The  same  lace  cloth  over  the  dining-room  table. 
Even  the  same  candle-sticks  upon  it.  The  same 
separate  bedrooms  and  separate  dens  that  I 
described  for  an  article  in  Photoplay  imme- 
diately after  their  wedding. 

And  the  same  people! 

Rod  was  in  his  work-shop  as  he  had  been 
five  years  before  when  I  called  unexpectedly. 
He  was  developing  pictures  of  Vilma.  He's 
concentrating  now  upon  photography. 

The  work-room  is  a  bit  different.  More 
equipment  in  it.  Rod  makes  furniture  today 
as  well  as  frames  for  Yilma's  embroidery.  He 
personally  manufactured  a  large  portion  of  the 
furniture  for  their  Arrowhead  Lake  summer 
home. 

After  rambling  through  the  house  at  will — 
I  had  taken  pictures  of  it  five  years  before  so 
I  knew  what  it  had  been — and  finding  no  alter- 
ations. I  said,  "Let's  sit  down  and  talk  it  over." 

"Talk  what  over?"  Vilma  looked  at  me 
queerly. 

"How  you've  made  marriage  a  success.  How 
you've  stuck  together  after  that  wedding." 

There  was  silence.  A  long  silence.  Then 
Vilma  said  in  that  slow  Hungarian  drawl  with 
only  a  shade  of  the  old  accent,  "There  is  no 
recipe  for  success  in  marriage." 

Rod  nodded  agreement. 

NOR  did  they  give  any.  Don't  misunder- 
stand me.  They  are  perfectly  willing  to  talk 
about  marriage.  Tell  any  or  all  of  the  little 
or  big  things  which  have  happened  to  them. 
But  as  to  laying  down  rules,  or  talking  plati- 
tudes— they  simply  don't  know  any.  What 
has  made  its  happy  might  make  the  next  couple 
unhappy,  is  their  theory. 

That  wedding,  for  example. 

It  was  a  publicity  stunt  to  everyone  but 


Vilma  and  Rod. 

And  to  them  it  was  just  their  marriage. 

They  had  planned  to  go  to  Santa  Barbara 
and  be  married  incognito  in  the  old  mission. 
Vilma  told  producer  Goldwyn  about  it.  But 
no!  They. must  be  married  here.  He  would 
arrange  the  wedding.  He  would  give  the  bride 
away.  He  would  get  a  million  dollars  of  pub- 
licity for  Vilma  from  it. 

"What  did  we  care?  What  difference  did  it 
make  about  the  ceremony?  What  we  were 
concerned  with  was  marriage.  If  Sam  wanted 
us  to  be  married  that  way — why  not?  "  It  was 
that  simple  to  Vilma. 

And  that  trip  she  took  to  Hungary  the  first 
year  of  the  marriage.  Do  you  remember  the 
stories?  She  had  left  him?  He  had  followed 
her  two  weeks  later  and  won  her  back? 

They  laughed  when  I  reminded  them  of  it. 
"Hollywood  did  not  understand  that  we  did 
not  make  this  marriage  for  just  a  year  or  two. 
We  did  not  have  to  use  up  every'  moment  of 
the  first  year  being  together  because  we  knew 
we  had  long  lives  before  us  in  which  we  would 
be  together!" 

IN  a  way,  I  think  that  sentence  explains 
their  situation.  They  took  happiness  for 
granted  from  the  first.  They  have  never  given 
a  thought  to  the  reverse  situation. 

Xot  that  they  haven't  had  storms  to  weather. 
They  are  no  demi-gods  who  consider  them- 
selves or  each  other  perfect. 

Take  the  matter  of  the  morning  newspaper. 
Rod  likes  to  have  his  paper  smooth  and  in 
order  when  he  first  reads  it.  Vilma  is  usually 
up  first.  She  opened  the  paper,  ran  through  it, 
woman-wise — reading  the  headlines,  folding 
and  twisting  the  paper.  When  he  came  to  it, 
it  looked  as  if  it  might  have  been  through  a 
Texas  tornado. 


He  started  to  say, "If  you  unfolded  it,  why 

in  H can't  you  fold  it?"    But  he  looked  up 

and  saw  her  serene  beauty  before  him  and  said 
instead,  "Do  you  mind,  dear,  refolding  the 
paper  when  you  have  finished  with  it?" 

Her  eyes  flashed  for  a  moment.  "Well,  of 
course,  if  you  don't  like  it,  we  can  order  two 
papers. " 

"All  right.    We  will,  then." 

But  later  in  the  day,  after  a  thousand  things 
had  crowded  in — telephone  calls,  shopping,  or- 
dering of  food,  discussion  of  pictures  which 
were  coming,  etc. — the  morning  paper  didn't 
seem  so  important.  Vilma  thought  of  it  fleet- 
ingly.  "How  foolish  to  order  two.  At  least, 
he  was  nice  about  it.  I  guess  it  wouldn't  hurt 
me  any  to  fold  it. "    And  now  she  does  fold  it! 

THEN  there  was  the  matter  of  Rod's  habit 
of  sleeping.  He  probably  likes  sleep  better 
than  any  man  in  the  country.  And  to  awaken 
him?  It  almost  takes  the  fire  department  to 
do  it! 

At  first,  Vilma  couldn't  understand.  It  an- 
noyed her  beyond  all  proportions.  She  just 
couldn't  find  excuses  for  a  man  whom  you 
could  shake,  kiss,  pound,  yell  at,  call  "The 
house  is  on  fire,"  and  who  continued  to  sleep 
as  though  you  were  non-existent. 

Came  the  day  of  Conrad  Nagel's  dinner.  He 
had  been  hunting,  and  brought  home  wild 
ducks.  All  the  little  group  of  which  Vilma 
and  Rod  are  members — the  Antonio  Morenos, 
Sidney  Franklyns,  Fred  Bennetts,  Bill  Hooks 
(Leatrice  Joy) — were  to  help  eat  them.  The 
dinner  was  for  seven. 

Rod  came  home  early  in  the  afternoon,  said : 
"I'm  going  to  sleep  a  few  minutes,  Vilma. " 

"Please  don't,  Rod.  We'll  never  get  you 
awake.    Please — -" 

"Just  for  twenty  minutes,  dear.  I'll  be  up 
and  ready.    I  promise." 

"Oh,  Rod — "  It  was  a  wail. 

At  a  quarter  of  eight  he  awakened,  looked 

at  his  watch,  jumped  from  the  bed.    "  Vilma ! " 

He  rushed  toward  her  room.     "Why  didn't 

you  call  me?    It's  nearly  eight.    We  were  to 

(    be  there  at  seven.    Why  in  thunder — " 

Vilma  was  in  a  little  heap  in  the  middle  of 
her  bed,  crying.  Her  dinner  dress  soiled.  Her 
eyes  red  and  swollen. 

She  had  even  called  his  family  and  they  had 
i  all  worked  to  awaken  him.  He  had  slept  peace- 
fully on.  Even  cold  water  had  no  effect  on 
him. 

And  how  did  Vilma  solve  that  problem? 
Now,  she  doesn't  let  him  go  to  sleep  while  en- 
gagements are  pending.  She  talks  incessantly; 
,  tells  funny  stories,  draws  him  into  animated 
discussions  on  subjects  in  which  he  has  a  keen 
interest.  Gets  him  to  argue.  Rod  likes  to 
argue.  He  will  never  fall  asleep  while  someone 
opposes  him.  Vilma  opposes  him — whether 
she  agrees  or  disagrees. 

Take  the  matter  of  parties.  Rod  hates  them. 
How  he  hates  them.  But  when  a  woman  has 
a  new  gown?  Especially  a  woman  as  beautiful 
as  Vilma  Banky!  At  first  that  caused  trouble. 
■  But  when  they  found  their  own  clique  (those 
mentioned  above),  people  whom  Rod  sincerely 
enjoys,  Vilma  discovered  that  a  woman  can 
be  as  proud  of  gowns  before  a  few  people  as 
she  can  before  a  great  number.  This  group 
meets  at  least  once  a  week.  During  the  sum- 
mers at  the  Nagels'  or  Franklyns'  Malibu 
houses  or  the  LaRocques'  Arrowhead  one. 

A  LL  this  more  or  less  forms  an  arrow  point- 
■*  *-ing  toward  Mrs.  LaRocque  as  the  secret  of 
this  successful  home,  doesn't  it? 

Well,  find  me  a  successful  home  anywhere 
and  I'll  discover  an  arrow  pointing  to  the 
woman ! 

Woman  has  been  the  home-maker  for  gen- 
erations. And  no  psychologist  in  the  world 
can  devise  schemes  to  upset  her.  This  home 
is  no  exception! 

But  Vilma  points  out  the  duty  of  the  other 

half  of  the  arrangement  in  one  sentence:    "I 

:    love  it.    It's  been  no  sacrifice  because  Rod  ap- 

\    preciates  everything  so.    He's  just  like  a  little 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  July,  1932 

boy.  I  can't  do  enough  because  he  is  so  grate- 
ful!" 

But  what  of  their  careers?  Perhaps  if  they 
had  both  continued  to  be  big  stars  or  if  one 
had  grown  beyond  the  other  as  in  the  case  of 
Ann  Harding  and  Harry  Bannister — ? 

"It  would  have  been  perhaps  more  diffi- 
cult, "  Rod  admits  frankly.  "  Neither  Vilma 
nor  I  has  been  obsessed  with  ambition  since  we 
fell  in  love  with  each  other.  I  told  Vilma  from 
the  first  that  I  would  rather  be  a  successful 
husband  than  a  successful  actor  because  mar- 
riage would  last  a  lifetime  and  acting  wouldn't. 
She  felt  the  same  way  about  it. " 

Obsessed  with  ambition!  A  description  of 
Hollywood  in  three  words.  A  disease  which 
these  two  have  avoided. 

"NJATURALLY,  they  would  like  to  make 
•*-^more  pictures.  Because  they  enjoy  them. 
Because  they  are  human  and  appreciate  the 
fame  and  the  fortune  that  comes  from  that 
enjoyment. 

But  they  do  not  want  that  fame  to  the  ex- 
clusion of  everything  else.  When  they  were 
offered  the  opportunity  to  take  their  play, 
"Cherries  Are  Ripe,"  with  which  they  toured 
the  United  States  and  Canada  for  a  year,  to 
New  York,  they  refused.  "It  is  not  a  Broad- 
way show.    It  would  flop  in  a  week. " 

Their  managers  thought  they  were  crazy. 
But  when  such  eminent  actors  as  Mary  Ellis 
and  Basil  Sydney  did  take  it  to  Brooklyn  and 
it  flopped  in  a  week,  they  smiled  and  congratu- 
lated each  other. 

Irving  Thalberg  asked  Rod  to  play  in  the 
screen  version  of  "Let  Us  Be  Gay."  Rod  was 
flattered.  He  signed  the  contract  without  see- 
ing the  play,  thinking  of  course  that  Mr.  Thal- 
berg knew  whether  he  fitted  the  part. 

A  few  days  later,  Vilma  and  Rod  saw  it  at 
a  local  theater.  Rod  immediately  asked  to  be 
released.    He  didn't  get  the  release. 

He  was  not  good  in  the  part,  he  felt.  Had 
he  been  more  ambitious,  he  would  have  been 
willing  to  play  with  Norma  Shearer  whether 
he  thought  he  could  do  justice  to  the  role  or 
not. 

Rod  was  once  one  of  the  most  popular  and 
highest  paid  stars.  His  fan  mail  was  prodi- 
gious. But  he  says,  "I  will  make  a  good  pic- 
ture again  because  I  love  the  work  and  want 
to  get  back  into  it.  Money  is  really  no  con- 
sideration. I  have  wanted  a  good  part.  I  do 
not  wish  to  do  something  which  would  look 
like  a  bad  job. " 

They  sent  for  him  to  discuss  the  part  of  the 
husband  for  "Westward  Passage,"  with  Ann 
Harding.  Rod  frankly  told  them  he  did  not 
believe  he  was  suited  to  the  part.  The  fact 
that  this  picture  is  being  entirely  re-made  with 
E.  H.  Griffith  directing,  proves  Rod  to  have 
been  right — that  the  script  was  not  the  best. 
But  the  fact  that  it  is  being  re-made  with  a 
new  script  and  a  splendid  director  looks  as 
though  Rod  may  have  made  a  mistake,  missed 
his  big  "break." 

VILMA  was  recentlyofferedtheTalaBirellrole 
in  "The  Doomed  Battalion,"  for  Universal. 
She  did  not  like  the  part  so  she  refused  it.  If 
she  had  been  obsessed  with  ambition,  she  would 
have  snatched  any  role  to  return  to  the  screen 
— to  show  the  producers  she  is  more  beautiful 
today  than  she  was  when  she  finished  her  con- 
tract with  Sam  Goldwyn.  And  to  show  the 
depths  of  her  fine  voice,  the  elimination  of 
the  accent  which  has  come  from  study  with 
Dr.  Marifiotti  and  Samuel  Kayser — Ann  Hard- 
ing's teacher. 

And  if  they  had  been  financially  ambitious, 
they  would  not  have  established  a  trust  fund 
at  three  and  one-half  and  four  and  one-half 
per  cent  interest  immediately  after  they  were 
married.  They  would  have  gambled  on  the 
stock  market  and  attempted  to  get  rich  more 
quickly. 

Rod  used  to  bound  in  and  say,  "Vilma,  I 
guess  we  are  fools.  If  we  had  put  the  money 
into  copper  we'd  have  made  five  points  today. 
It  went  up." 

And  Vilma  would  shake  her  head  and  say,

How  Do  You  Look  in  a  Bathing  Suit? 

[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  71  ] 


Now  there's  a  sensible,  balanced  diet  for  the 
in-betweens,  but  don't  think  that  you  can  eat 
your  heads  off  just  because  you're  not  on  as 
strenuous  a  diet  as  the  fat  girls.  That  diet  is 
for  people  who  are  neither  overweight  nor  un- 
derweight. 

"P  VERY  morningstand  in  front  of  an  open  win- 
•*-" 'dow  without  your  clothes  and  give  yourself 
an  air  bath.  Breathe  deeply.  Laugh.  Sing.  Yes, 
I  mean  it. 

I'm  serious.  Laugh  for  beauty.  Sing,  too. 
Both  laughing  and  singing  are  wonderful  chest 
developers. 

Sun  baths,  when  you  can  take  them,  are 
great  for  you,  too.  But  I  implore  you  to  use 
your  common  sense  and  don't  overdo  sun 
bathing  at  first. 

The  first  day,  lie  one  and  one-half  minutes 
on  each  side. 

The  next  day  lie  in  the  sun  for  five  minutes 
on  each  side.  You  know  how  you  feel.  Don't 
make  yourself  sick  lying  in  the  sun  and  if 
you're  blonde  and  subject  to  severe  sunburn, 
cover  your  head,  face  and  neck  with  a  red 
chiffon  veil.  It  will  prevent  that  very  bad 
sunburn. 

Now — there  are  some  general  things  that  all 
of  you  can  do. 

But  about  those  lumps  ?  During  these  arti- 
cles I've  told  you  many  exercises  for  various 
parts  of  the  body. 

If  you  need  them,  persist  with  them,  but  let 
me  explain  the  purpose  of  exercising. 

What  I've  done  with  the  stars  is  to  smash  off 
the  fat  cells  with  pressure.  That's  what  you 
must  do. 

When  you're  taking  the  hip  reducing  exer- 
cises, for  instance,  make  sure  that  you  feel  the 
muscles  in  your  hips  pulling. 

You've  got  to  concentrate  on  the  proper 
muscles.  I  can't  show  each  one  of  you  how 
to  do  it. 

You've  got  to  have  sense  enough  to  figure 
it  out  from  the  exercise  pictures  and  the  ex- 
planations under  them. 

When  you  take  the  hip  exercise,  feel  the 
hip  muscles  pull  as  you  pull  yourself  along. 
Tense  your  toe  as  you  drag  yourself  along 
so  that  those  muscles  pull. 

Now  if  you  have  bulges  of  fat  on  the  hip 
bones,  here  is  an  exercise.  With  arms  above 
head  make  your  body  describe  a  circle  at  the 
waist,  but  lean  over  with  your  body  until  you 
feel  your  torso  touching  the  fat  place  you  want 
reduced,  until  you  feel  the  fat  cells  being 
smashed  off.  Use  your  torso  as  I  use  my  hands 
when  I  smash  off  fat  from  the  stars.  But  never 
forget  what  portion  of  the  body  you  want  to 
reduce.  Just  taking  the  exercises  will  do  you 
no  good  unless  you  use  the  brains  that  some- 
times your  letters  make  me  believe  you  haven't 
any  of! 

"VDU'LL  find  on  these  pages  an  exercise  to  re- 
*■  duce  large  thighs  and  knees  and  lumpson  the 
side  of  the  knees.  Also  you'll  find  a  big  close- 
up  picture  of  my  hands  showing  you  how  you 
can  smash  off  those  fat  cells.  This  is  how  I 
take  flesh  off  the  stars.  But  you  can  do  it 
yourself.  You  can  squeeze  the  fat  off  any  part 
of  your  body — except,  of  course,  the  breasts — 
by  using  your  hands  as  I  am  using  mine  in  the 
picture — that  goes  for  arms,  legs,  hips,  thighs, 
knees,  fat  just  below  the  bust,  fat  at  the  waist, 


etc.,  etc.  When  you've  finished  the  squeezing 
process,  cover  the  part  you  want  reduced  with 
a  Turkish  towel  and  slam  the  muscle  good  and 
hard. 

Hit  hard,  even  if  it  hurts  you. 

TN  order  to  build  up  the  calves  of  the  legs, 
-'-hips  and  thighs  do  tap  dancing,  jump  rope,  do 
bicycle  riding  and  also  do  the  exercise — the 
scissors  movement  I  call  it — that  I've  illus- 
trated on  these  pages. 

Do  these  things  until  you  feel  muscle-bound 
— because  that  means  that  you're  beginning 
to  develop. 

Several  people  have  asked  me  about  gym- 
nasium work.  Haven't  you  the  courage  to  do 
it  yourself?  Make  your  bedroom,  your  living 
room  or — in  these  summer  days — your  back- 
yard your  gymnasium.  Get  a  group  of  your 
friends  together  out  in  your  backyard  and 
have  your  own  gymnasium,  doing  the  exer- 
cises that  I've  taught  you. 

Maybe  I  should  not  have  said  that.  I  know 
the  letters  I'll  get,  "Dear  Sylvia,  I  haven't 
any  backyard.  What  shall  I  do?"  or  "Dear 
Sylvia,  I  haven't  any  friends.  What  shall  I 
do?"  I'm  not  being  silly.  I  had  one  woman 
write  me  that  she  couldn't  do  the  dancing  ex- 
ercises because  she  didn't  have  a  radio.  Well, 
she  has  a  pair  of  lungs,  hasn't  she?  She  can 
hum  a  tune  to  herself  while  she's  doing  the 
dancing. 

And  another  woman  wrote  that  her  room 
was  too  small  to  do  the  exercises  in.  Then 
she  must  do  the  exercises  up  and  down  instead 
of  progressing  along  the  floor. 

Do  you  blame  me  for  getting  disgusted  with 
you  sometimes?  I  can't  think  for  you.  Why 
do  I  bother  with  you  ? 

I  wonder.  For  if  you  haven't  the  courage 
to  be  lovely,  if  you  can't  use  your  heads,  you 
don't  deserve  a  good  figure. 

And  yet,  because  I  know  it  can  be  done  and 
because  I  know  how  lovely  you  can  be  if  you 
will,  I  keep  on  hoping  that  the  silly  ones  will 
get  some  sense. 

SWIMMING  builds  you  up.  It  doesn't  re- 
duce you.  But  sun  bathing  in  a  bathing 
suit  and  cold  plunges  in  the  water  at  the 
beach  are  marvelous. 

You  over-fat  ones,  do  that.  You  skinny  ones 
can  swim! 

Also,  don't  forget  that  if  you  take  any  of 
my  diets  and  keep  up  the  facial  massages  that 
I've  given  you — you  won't  lose  in  the  face. 
You've  got  to  do  what  I  tell  you  and  you've 
got  to  take  the  exercises  I  give.  Suppose  you're 
doing  the  stomach  exercise  and  your  hip  bones 
protrude  and  hurt  you  as  you  roll  along  the 
floor — what  does  it  matter?  You've  got  to 
have  courage  if  you  want  a  lovely  figure.  Any- 
body can  do  these  exercises — even  if  she  be 
seventy.  Limber  yourself  up  first  with  danc- 
ing. 

The  lumps  will  come  off  quickly  or  slowly 
according  to  the  stamina  you  have  and  it 
doesn't  matter  whether  you  take  the  exercises 
slowly  or  vigorously  so  long  as  you  concentrate 
on  the  part  you're  reducing.  Think  of  the 
muscles  you're  trying  to  take  off  and  watch 
them  disappear.  You  should  take  all  new  ex- 
ercises slowly  at  first.  Presently  you'll  be  do- 
ing them  so  vigorously — because  j'ou're  so  full 
of  pep — that  your  family  will  think  you've 


gone  crazy.  And  after  you've  finished  your 
exercises  in  the  morning  and  haven't  anything 
else  to  do,  take  a  cold  shower — if  you  react 
properly,  that  is,  feel  a  warm  glow — and  work 
on  your  spine  with  a  rough  towel.  That  puts 
pep  into  you.  Then  go  on  with  the  business 
of  the  day.  You  won't  feel  like  doing  much 
sitting  down,  I  can  tell  you! 

•"THE  scissors  exercise  I've  given  you  will  fill 
*■  out  all  the  skinny  places  in  your  legs  and 
thighs,  but  if  you've  marred  your  legs  with 
rolled  stockings,  you'd  better  squeeze  off  some 
of  the  flesh  just  below  the  indentation  to  make 
your  legs  look  symmetrical,  and  if  your  legs 
don't  meet  between  the  thighs,  stimulate  those 
muscles  with  massage  to  make  them  meet. 

You  can  do  anything  with  your  figure  that 
you  care  to  do — you  fat  girls,  you  thin  girls 
and  you  in-betweens. 

Jump  right  in  and  do  it  and  next  month  I'm 
going  to  tell  you  some  things  about  how  to 
get  rid  of  the  nervous  jitters,  that  lots  of  you 
suffer  from.  I've  got  some  swell  tricks  left,  up 
my  sleeve.

Hollywood  on  Dress  Parade 

by  Seymour 


IF  you  can  battle  your  way  through  the 
crowds  to  get  a  front  line  trench  view  of 
celebrities  arriving  tor  a  Hollywood  pre- 
miere, you  will  see  what's  what  in  film  fashions. 
Everyone's  on  dress  parade.  Swinging  from  an 
electric  sign  at  the  "Grand  Hotel"  opening,  I 
jotted  down  these  notes. 

Joan  Crawford,  nearly  mobbed  by  enthusi- 
astic fans,  wore  a  pale  blue  frock  topped  by  a 
brief  jacket,  the  short  sleeves  of  which  were 
edged  with  cuffs  of  summer  ermine. 

Lilyan  Tashman  and  Constance  Bennett 
also  wore  blue — Lilyan  satin  and  Connie  a  dull 
crepe.  In  fact,  the  Olympic,  bicentennial  or 
whatever  you  call  them,  colors  of  red,  white 
and  blue,  appear  to  be  smart  Hollywood's 
fashion  flag  for  the  summer. 

Hedda  Hopper  calls  premieres  "Hollywood 
show  windows,  where  the  grandest  of  its 
fashions  are  on  display."  Isn't  that  apt 
phrasing? 

"D  REVITY  was  the  keynote  of  evening  wraps 
-'-'at  this  opening — either  very  short  capes  or 
jackets.  Lilyan  Tashman  wore  her  famous 
silver  fox  cape  but  now  she  isn't  exclusive  for 
Constance  Talmadge,  Gwili  Andre  and  Zita 
Johann  all  have  similar  ones. 

Three  lovely  ladies  at  the  "Grand  Hotel" 
opening  probably  gave  their  dressmakers  a 
good  berating  the  next  day,  for  they  each  wore 
dresses,  identical  in  design  and  coloring!  The 
saddest  part  of  the  picture  was  the  fact  that 
the  dresses  are  said  to  have  cost  three  hundred 
and  fifty  dollars  apiece.  What  price  exclusive- 
ness! 

"V'OU  will  soon  be  adjusting  your  hats  to  a 
-1-  new  angle — straight  over  the  eyes!  How 
does  that  appeal  to  you  after  all  this  angle 
tipping?  Yet  while  rumors  of  the  straight 
brimline  are  rife,  certain  smart  young  things 
are  reviving  the  bat  worn  well  back  on  the 
head. 

Have  you  heard  about  the  "evening  beach 
frock"?  This  somewhat  fantastic  garment  is 
being  launched  by  an  American  designer  and 
was  suggested  by  the  popularity  of  pique  for 


evening.  Linen,  pique  and  even  gingham  are 
used  for  this  newest  of  beach  fashions. 

CPEAKING  of  beach  fashions,  I  don't  believe 
'"-'there  has  ever  been  a  summer  when  the  stars 
have  had  such  a  variety  of  styles.  On  the 
whole,  the  clothes  worn  at  Malibu  and  Santa 
Monica  are  practical  play  clothes.  Most  of  the 
stars  are  wearing  shorts  or  slacks  in  lieu  of  beach 
pyjamas.  These  are  colorful,  especially  when 
combined  with  the  other  accessories.  However, 
a  few  like  Loretta  Young  still  cling  to  the 
pyjama.  Loretta  has  always  been  an  en- 
thusiast for  this  garment.  Her  newest  ones  are 
white  pique  with  flared  trousers  and  a  tiny 
bolero.  Loretta  has  a  clever  stunt  with  beach 
sandals — she  buys  dozens  of  white  canvas  ones 
and  has  them  dyed  to  match  each  pyjama. 
Clever,  what? 

Bette  Davis  wears  bright  red,  one-piece 
corduroy  pyjamas.  A  bandana  hankie,  tied 
casually  about  the  neck,  accompanies  this. 

Both  Joan  Crawford  and  Connie  Bennett 
vary  the  usual  beach  color  scheme  Connie 
wears  a  brown  bathing  suit  and  brown  linen 
pyjamas.  And  Joan  wears  maroon  slacks  with 
a  maroon  and  white  sweater  that  is  almost 
backless  and  has  a  square  neckline.  Maroon  is 
a  good  color  tip  for  you  who  have  a  rich,  even 
suntan  like  Joan's. 

JUNE  COLLYER  has  a  unique  accessory  idea 
that  she  carries  out  with  print  frocks — she 
wears  a  row  of  flowers  like  those  in  her  frock 
around  the  crown  of  her  straw  hat.  The  other 
day  at  lunch  she  wore  a  hat  wreathed  in  white 
daisies  to  match  similar  ones  printed  on  the 
blue  background  of  her  dress. 

Joan  Bennett  has  a  suggestion  for  varying 
one  simple  frock  endlessly.  She  has  a  white 
rough  crepe  sports  frock  with  a  wide  stitched 
belt.  With  it  she  wears  any  number  of  dash- 
ing little  Ascot  scarves,  one  at  a  time,  of  course, 
and  in  different  colors.  Each  has  her  mono- 
gram on  it.  It  is  amazing  how  easily  this 
changes  the  look  of  her  dress  with  each  new  set 
of  accessories- — and  such  an  inexpensive  way  of 
padding  out  the  sports  wardrobe!

Clara  Bow — Housewife  of  Rancho  Clarito 


CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  29 


and  said:  "That's  where  we're  going  to  build 
on'  house." 

Well,  they've  built  it.    What  a  house! 

It's  a  house  that  would  be  a  show-place  even 
in  Hollywood,  or  Beverly  Hills.  But  imagine 
it,  surrounded  by  endless  miles  of  desert, 
twenty-two  awful  miles  from  the  nearest  rail- 
road station,  many  miles  from  the  nearest 
neighbor.  Imagine  what  it  cost  to  haul  stuff 
there,  build  such  a  place! 

A  modern  home  with  a  red  tile  roof  in  that 
awful  stretch  of  wasteland,  and  you  can  see  it 
for  dozens  of  miles  from  all  directions. 

It  has  its  own  electric  light  plant,  for  there 
isn't  a  power  line  (or  even  a  telephone  line) 
within  miles  of  it.  It  has  its  own  water  system 
—clean  mountain  spring  water,  piped  nearly 
thirty  miles  across  mountain  and  desert,  at  a 
cost  of  $18,000 — to  run  hot  and  cold  at  the  turn 
of  a  faucet,  just  as  though  they  were  in  the 
heart  of  New  York.  It  has  five  bedrooms  and 
a  bath  for  each,  believe  it  or  not!  And  a  bath- 
room in  the  desert  is  about  as  expected  as  a 
snowstorm  in  the  Sahara. 

It  has  rock  gardens  and  cactus  gardens  that 
rival  the  most  famous  landscape  developments 
of  the  world's  most  famous  homes. 

It  has  a  "playroom" — and  that  means,  you 
may  as  well  know  it  as  all  Hollywood  does,  a ' 
home  barroom.  It's  got  what  Rex  and  Clara 
maintain  is  the  "largest  sitting  room  in  the 
world. "  I  don't  know  how  many  feet  wide  by 
how  many  feet  long  it  is,  but  you  could  stage  a 
hockey  match,  a  basketball  game  and  the  Ken- 
tucky Derby  in  it,  and  still  have  room  for  a 
table  of  bridge  or  two. 

A  ND  in  that  sitting  room  is  the  pride  and 
"*Vjoy  of  the  place — a  ten-foot  fireplace  in 
which  they  burn  tremendous  logs,  as  they  sit 
before  it  and  tell  each  other  how  much  they 
love  each  other  and  how  happy  they  are,  this 
Mr.  and  Mrs.  Rex  Bell. 

And  that's  the  castle  over  which  Mrs.  Rex 
Bell — Clara  Bow  to  you,  if  you  insist — rules 
as  chatelaine. 


Not  that  she's  got  any  staff  of  servants  to 
rule  over.  That's  the  amazing  part  of  it! 
Clara  fired  all  her  servants  a  long  time  ago,  and 
she  hasn't  hired  any  new  ones  since.  Clara  is 
not  only  mistress  of  that  desert  mansion — she's 
the  whole  darned  crew,  except  for  one  darky  by 
the  name  of  Jim,  or  maybe  it's  James.  Jim  is 
just  one  of  those  men-of-all-work.  He  buttles, 
he  cooks  a  bit  of  breakfast  now  and  then  when 
Clara  wants  to  sleep  late,  he  serves  table,  he 
does  the  odd  things  around  the  house — the  odd 
things  that  Clara  herself  doesn't  do. 

But  it's  Clara  who  really  does  the  work! 

TT'S  Clara  who  does  all  the  cooking,  save  for 
■Mhat  occasional  breakfast-in-bed !  Clara  cooks 
not  alone  for  herself  and  her  hubby,  but  she 
cooks  for  the  ranch  hands,  and  the  guests. 
There  are  almost  always  guests.  Relatives  of 
Rex's,  mostly.  There  are  five  bedrooms,  as 
I've  told  you,  and  somehow,  relatives  learn 
that  there  are  bedrooms. 

But  anyway,  Clara  cooks.  She  cooks  hash, 
often.  A  most  amazing  hash.  It's  not  the 
namby-pamby,  wishy-washy  hash  you  get  at 
corner  lunchrooms.  It's  a  lusty,  gusty  hash 
like  cowboys  eat.  It  fairly  jumps  up  and 
smacks  you  in  the  face  when  it's  dished  out  on 
your  plate.    I  know.    I  ate  some  of  it. 

More,  she  cooks  prunes.  Her  stewed  prunes 
are  her  particular  joy.  Not  that  they're  any 
different  from  anybody  else's  stewed  prunes, 
mind  you.  No,  there's  no  more  individuality 
to  a  dish  of  stewed  prunes  than  there  is  to  a 
movie  extra.  But  Rex  loves  prunes,  and  Clara 
loves  to  stew  'em  for  him,  and  that's  that. 

More,  she  bakes.  She  bakes  bread — kneads 
it  herself,  with  her  own  hands,  and  puts  it  in 
the  oven  and  sticks  a  straw  from  the  kitchen 
broom  into  it  to  see  if  it's  done,  and  takes  it  out 
herself.  And  she  burns  herself  doing  it,  too. 
Rex  says  he's  always  walking  around  with  a 
box  of  soda  in  one  pocket  for  Clara's  cooking- 
burns,  and  a  bottle  of  iodine  in  the  other  to  use 
when  she  cuts  herself. 

She  bakes  cake,  too.     This  is  a  mean  thing

The  main  street  of  Searchlight,  Nev.,  is  a  far  cry  from  Hollywood's  beauti- 
ful boulevards.  But  this  is  where  Clara  Bow  and  Rex  find  amusement. 
Note  the  open  gambling   shack.     They  sell  more  than  Coca-Cola  here 


to  tell,  but  the  other  day  a  friend  stopped  in 
and  had  dinner.  He  had  hash.  Then  Clara 
brought  in  a  piece  of  her  cake.  "  Baked  it  my- 
self and  you  gotta  eat  it,"  she  told  him.  He 
doesn't  like  cake,  this  fellow  I'm  telling  about. 
But  he  didn't  want  to  hurt  the  little  bride's 
feelings,  so  he  ate  the  cake— all  of  it,  and  it  was 
a  whole  quarter  of  a  cake,  Clara's  that  gen- 
erous! Then  he  bade  adieu,  and  started  off 
for  Searchlight,  six  miles  away  across  the 
desert,  an  old  mining  town.  He  said  later 
that  the  "ride  or  something"  made  him  feel 
kind  of  seasick. 

CLARA  uses  a  cook  book,  though.  She's  al- 
ways looking  things  up  and  making  them. 
Rex  says  they  have  guessing  contests  after  each 
meal  to  see  who  can  guess  first  what  it  was 
Clara  made.  And  she  hates  to  have  people 
"underfoot"  in  the  kitchen  when  she's  cooking. 

If  anyone  comes  in,  she  glowers.  If  the 
glowering  doesn't  take  effect,  she  invites  the 
person  to  get  the  so-and-so  out  of  there.  She 
doesn't  want  anyone  around  until  she  sings 
out,  "come  an'  get  it."  That's  old  Western 
ranch  talk  from  the  cook  when  the  meal's  ready 
— a  lusty  bellowed,  "come  an'  get  it."  You 
should  hear  Clara  yell  it! 

Oh,  all  this  may  sound  like  a  lot  of  kidding. 
But  it  really  isn't.  It's  serious.  Clara's  cook- 
ing is  no  bride's  play;  it's  cooking.  Cooking  for 
a  dozen  people  isn't  play.  But  it's  fun  to 
Clara.  Maybe  she'll  get  tired  of  it,  after  a 
while,  but  at  present  she's  having  the  time  of 
her  life.    And  she  takes  it  seriously. 

They  still  talk,  up  there  on  the  ranch,  of  the 
time  the  batch  of  bread-dough  wouldn't  rise. 
Clara  had  mixed  it  and  kneaded  it  and  kneaded 
it,  and  if  you've  ever  kneaded  bread-dough, 
you'll  know  what  that  means. 

And  then  it  didn't  rise! 

Clara  stood  there  and  looked  at  it,  called  it 
the  most  amazing  names  bread-dough  has  ever 
been  called,  and  then  suddenly  started  bawling 
like  a  two-day  bride.  She  cried  as  though  her 
heart  was  broken! 

And  flapjacks! 

It's  a  good  joke,  but  it's  true — the  champion 
flapper  of  them  all  has  developed  into  another 
kind  of  champion  flapper.  She  flaps  pancakes 
like  nobody's  business,  and  if  ever  Mr.  Childs 
needs  someone  to  take  the  place  of  that  feller 
who  keeps  flapping  them  in  his  restaurant 
window,  then  he  can  call  on  Clara  Bow. 

"When  I  first  learned  to  flap  a  batter  cake 
without  slopping  it  over  the  side,  it  gave  me  a 
bigger  thrill  than  I  ever  got  out  of  any  screen 


role  in  my  life,"  says  Clara.    Is  thai  a  pay-off? 

But  cooking  isn't  Clara's  whole  life,  nowa- 
days. Good  Lord,  no!  Probably  you,  who  are 
reading  this,  know  that  dishes  have  to  be 
washed.  Well,  they  have  to  be  washed  in 
Nevada,  too.  And  it's  Clara  who  does  the  dish- 
washing.' No  words  this  or  any  other  writer 
could  type  could  ever  tell  that  story.  Clara 
Bow  washing  dishes!    Need  more  be  said? 

There's  been  a  lot  of  talk  about  Clara,  during 
these  away-from-the-screen  months  of  matri- 
mony. There  have  been  rumors,  for  example, 
that  she's  going  to  be  a  mother.  But  there's 
nothing  to  that,  says  Clara,  and  she  ought  to 
know.    Oh,  some  day,  maybe! 

And  there  have  been  rumors  that  she's  fat. 
Those  rumors  aren't  as  far-fetched  as  the  other 
one— but  even  at  that,  they're  exaggerated. 
Clara's  plump,  but  she's  always  been  plump. 
Right  now,  when  she  tucks  her  head  down  a 
bit,  there's  a  double  chin.  But  that'll  come  off 
quickly. 

"A  little  too  much  tummy,"  she  says.  But 
that,  too,  will  come  off  quickly.  "  You  know,  I 
always  did  photograph  plump,  even  at  my 
thinnest.  I  always  had  to  watch  the  angle,  and 
I  still  have  to  watch  it."     She  looks  grand. 

A  year  ago  Photoplay  told  you  about  that 
air  of  ineffable  sadness  and  weariness  about 
her.  Photoplay  was  wrong.  It  wasn't  ineff- 
able. Because  it's  been  effaced.  Today, 
there's  no  longer  that  look  of  deep  world- 
weariness  in  Clara  Bow's  eyes.  They  sparkle, 
like  a  kid's.  Her  smile  is  real,  not  a  camera 
grin.  Clara  Bow's  having  the  grandest  time 
Clara  Bow  ever  had! 

AS  for  that  weight  of  hers,  that's  nothing. 
She's  taking  care  of  it  right  now.  For  one 
thing  (and  will  this  give  you  a  laugh)  Clara  is 
captain  of  the  girls'  indoor  baseball  team  of 
Searchlight.  The  team  is  composed  of  the  girls 
and  young  married  women  of  the  town  that's 
been  called  "Reno's  little  stepsister,"  and 
Clara's  one  of  the  stars  of  the  team.  Too,  she 
plays  baseball  on  Searchlight's  empty  lots  (and 
there  are  lots  of  them)  with  the  urchins  of  the 
town. 

Not  that  Searchlight  takes  Clara  for  granted. 
She's  been  living  on  that  ranch  six  miles  from 
there  for  more  than  a  year  now,  and  they  still 
regard  her  with  something  of  awe  and  curi- 
osity. Searchlight's  kids  follow  her  up  and 
down  the  street  when  she  and  Rex  come  to 
town  to  shop,  or  gamble  a  little  in  the  gambling 
halls.  Gambling  is  legal  in  Nevada,  you  know. 
Ami  bartenders  (yes,  even  though  the  federals 


do  raid  the  town  once  in  a  while,  there  are 
wide-open  bars  and  bartenders)  discuss  Clara 
as  they  discuss  the  depression  and  Hoover  and 
the  good  old  days. 

"HPHEY  tell  me,"  said  one  bartender,  as  he 

■*■  mixed  a  mean  gin  fizz,  "that  Clara's  going 
to  make  another  picture.  But  she's  gotta  take 
off  some  fat!  Here  and  there,  I  mean.  She 
ain't  exactly  fat  but  she's  kinda  out  o'  propor- 
tion, I'd  say."  Anyway,  it  was  a  swell  fizz  he 
made.    And  the  beer.  .  .  .! 

Now,  don't  get  mad,  you  Bow  fans.  That's 
not  telling  tales  out  of  school — that  stuff  about 
Clara's  overweight.  She  admits  it  herself.  As 
a  matter  of  fact,  she  says  one  of  the  main 
reasons  she  fired  her  servants  and  cook,  and 
went  to  cooking  herself,  was  that  "Rex  needed 
to  put  on  a  few  pounds  and  I  needed  to  get  rid 
of  a  few,  and  this  way  we're  both  doing  it." 

Yes,  Rex  works.  Rex  is  no  movie-actor  cow- 
boy. He's  up  every  morning  at  four  o'clock 
(consider  that,  you  eight  o'clock  getters-up, 
when  you  envy  the  movie  stars!)  with  the  rest 
of  the  ranch  hands.  That  ranch  is  600,000 
acres  big,  and  it's  got  25  horses  and  1,500 
head  of  cattle,  not  to  mention  a  lot  of  dogs  and 
chickens.     It's  got  a  dozen  cowhands. 

And  it's  Clara  who's  the  comfy  little  wife 
when  Rex's  day  is  done.  They've  got  a  radio, 
of  course.  And  a  movie  machine.  They  are 
having  a  sound  apparatus  put  in,  and  by  the 
time  you  read  this  the  living  room  will  be  wired 
for  sound,  so  they  can  have  talkies.  So,  at  the 
end  of  the  day,  Rex  comes  in,  eats  Clara's 
supper,  and  then  they  have  their  little  necking 
party  in  that  colossal  living  room.  Are  they 
happy?  Are  they!  I  told  you  you'd  never 
have  believed  it  of  Clara. 

Talking  about  chickens  a  paragraph  or  so 
back  there,  it's  Clara  who's  their  protector. 
She  has  a  high-powered  rifle  standing  in  the 
kitchen  at  al!  times.  When  I  was  there  in  the 
kitchen  watching  her  fix  up  something  for 
supper,  she  looked  out  of  the  window  and  made 
a  sudden  dive  for  the  gun. 

She  grabbed  it,  raced  out  the  door,  and  me 
after  her.  Around  a  corner  of  the  house,  and 
there  she  stopped,  propped  the  gun  against  her 
shoulder,  pointed  the  muzzle  up — and  wham! 
Two  shots — and  a  chicken  hawk  flopped  down

dead.  Clara  has  killed  more  hawks!  Rabbits, 
too.  Her  pet  amusement  is  hopping  astraddle 
a  riding  horse,  with  two  of  Rex's  pearl-handled 
revolvers  in  holsters,  and  a  rifle  slung  across 
the  saddle.  She  rides  the  range  then,  popping 
away  at  rabbits. 

Oh,  the  gal's  happy.  She  admits  it.  Admits 
that  for  the  first  time  in  her  life,  she  knows 
what  happiness  means.  She  looks  forward  to 
making  that  movie  with  reluctance. 

"I'm  not  hailing  it  with  any  enthusiasm," 
she  says,  in  so  many  words.  Then  she  spreads 
her  hands  around  that  $200,000  shack,  and 
adds,  "but  all  this  takes  money." 

"  I'd  just  as  soon  stay  here  and  never  work 
again,"  she  goes  :>n.  "In  fact,  I've  turned 
down  several  S20,000-a-week  vaudeville  offers 
But  we've  all  gotta  have  money,  and  so  do  Rex 
and  I.  All  that  talk  about  the  trust  fund  I've 
got  is  just  another  Hollywood  rumor. 

"As  a  matter  of  fact,  I  hate  money.  Especi- 
ally when  you  make  it  and  have  to  turn  it  over 
o  the  government  for  income  tax!" 

You  have  to  prod  her  to  get  her  to  talk  about 
her  career.  She  says,  when  you  insist  on  talk- 
ing about  it,  that  she'll  never  play  another 
"It"  role.  This  new  role — in  "Call  Her 
Savage" — presents  her  in  the  role  of  a  half- 
breed  girl  who  is  suddenly  brought  from  no 
place  into  the  midst  of  civilization.  She's  a 
little  hellcat,  and  upsets  everything  and  every- 
body with  her  rank  naturalness.  Clara  says  as 
long  as  she's  got  to  make  another  movie  to  get 
some  money,  that  she  likes  the  role  better  than 
anything  else  she  could  have  had.  "  For  a 
change,  I'll  be  able  to  say,  'Oh,  Jeez!'  instead 
of  'Oh,  goodness! '  "  she  explains. 

SHE  hates  crowds.  Fox  have  agreed  to  have 
her  picture  made  at  the  old,  half-dismant- 
led, now-unused  Western  Avenue  lot  instead  of 
the  new  busy  studio  at  Movietone  City.  Be- 
cause there  won't  be  any  crowds,  people,  at  the 
old  lot,  and  Clara  will  be  comparatively  alone. 
She's  never  gotten  over  her  "mike  fright," 
either,  she  confesses,  and  dreads  the  thought  of 
making  a  talkie.  But  she'll  do  it — and  she'll  do 
it  only  because  the  $75,000  she'll  get  for  it  will 
ensure  her  being  able  to  return  for  a  long,  long 
time  to  Rancho  Clarito,  and  being  just  Missus 
Rex  Bell,  the  housewife.

Portrait  of  the  happiest  pair  in  Hollywood — can't  you  tell  they're  happy  by

Seas.     The  voyage  will  end  in  Honolulu,  where  Mary's  baby  will  be  born

Hi-Vita  process  which  preserves

Cal  York's  Monthly  Broadcast  from  Hollywood 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PACE   105  '| 


•"THE  story  of  Phil  Goldstonc,  Hollywood's 
1  S1.\(XX),(XX)  bachelor,  is  one  of  the  most 
amazing  in  all   iilmdom. 

Phil  is  one  of  the  cleverest  of  the  independ- 
ent producers. 

He  came  to  Hollywood  with  S8,000  that  he 
had  saved,  and  wanted  to  make  a  picture. 
His  "mama,"  whom  he  adores,  said  she  thought 
it  foolish.  His  "aunty"  believed  Phil  should 
take  a  chance  if  he  wanted  to.  For  once  in  his 
life  he  over-ruled  mama  and  did  a  film  with  a 
famous  European  acrobat  named  Ullman.  Phil 
changed  Ullman's  name  to  William  Fairbanks 
for  American  release.  His  picture  cost  exactly 
$8,000  and  in  Europe  alone  it  netted  S350,OO0. 

From  then  on  he  did  one  independent  picture 
after  another. 

He  was  head  of  Tiffany  Pictures  when 
"Journey's  End"  was  produced. 

He  has  made  his  millions  by  making  little 
pictures  and  big  profits. 

"Mama"  now  rides  in  a  Rolls  Royce.  And 
Phil  is  prouder  of  that  than  of  anything  that 
has  ever  happened  to  him. 


Florabel  Muir  has  mentioned  him  many 
times  in  her  column  in  the  Daily  News,  telling 
of  his  vast  wealth.  The  other  day  he  came  to 
her,  "Please  do  not  write  any  more  about  my 
having  so  much  money.  Mama  is  afraid  some- 
one will  kidnap  me." 

Phil  hates  to  be  made  fun  of  and  certainly 
nobody  should  ever  kid  Phil.  If  more  pro- 
ducers had  refrained  from  going  high-hat  they 
would  have  Goldstone's  money  instead  of 
their  own  gray  hairs. 

/"1PHE  phonograph  records  made  by 
Marlene  Dietrich  have  replaced 
those  of  Bing  Crosby  in  Joan  Craw- 
ford's affections.  On  the  set  of 
"Rain"  Joan  emotes  to  Marlene's 
voice  instead  of  to  Bing's. 

T-JE  is  eighty-two  but  he  has  a  steady  job  in 
pictures   as   long   as   Tom   Keene   makes 
Westerns. 

"Broncho  Charlie"  Miller,  the  last  of  the 
Pony  Express  Riders,  met  an  exec  from  Radio 


Pictures  in  New  York  a  year  ago  last  July. 
The  exec  told  Charlie  to  ride  to  Hollywood  on 
his  horse  and  he'd  give  him  a  job.  It  was  to  be 
a  publicity  stunt  for  the  first  of  the  Tom  Keene 
Westerns. 

"Broncho  Charlie"  left  the  New  York  City 
Hal]  July  6.  He  arrived  in  Hollywood  the 
following  March  to  find  Tom  Keene  on  his 
sixth  picture  and  the  studio  at  which  he  was 
supposed  to  be  making  them  closed.  No  one 
remembered  a  thing  about  Charlie.  He  had 
sent  no  letters,  no  telegrams,  no  expense 
account.  But  he  was  the  first  man  to  get 
from  New  York  to  Hollywood  on  horseback, 
in  spite  of  coming  near  death  twice. 

Fortunately  for  Charlie,  Tom  Keene  had 
made  good  in  Westerns  so  the  Pony  Express 
rider  and  his  horse,  Plastar,  have  been  assured 
jobs  for  the  rest  of  their  lives  at  $100  a  week. 

A  LOT  of  fur  coats  were  needed 
•^^  for  Connie  Bennett's  picture 
"What  Price  Hollywood." 

The  studio  telephoned  one  of  the 
most  exclusive  fur  houses  in  town. 
"I'm  sorry,"  the  girl  answered,  "we 
can't  send  you  any  coats  today. 
Everyone  we  have  has  been  rented 
for  tonight.  It's  the  opening  of 
'Grand  Hotel' !" 

CEXSATIONAL  Hollywood  picture  pfe- 
^mieres  have  been  topped  at  last.  And  believe 
it  or  not — in  London.  There  were  no  search- 
lights, national  broadcasts,  or  anything  of 
that  sort,  but  under  the  auspices  of  the  Prince 
of  Wales  the  opening  of  the  Corinne  Griffith 
picture  sold  out  at  forty  dollars  a  seat  to  the 
most  aristocratic  audience  that  ever  filled  a 
motion  picture  theater. 

Add  up  a  little  score  for  Beulah  Livingstone, 
Norma  Talmadge's  former  publicity  manager. 
She  put  it  over. 

"TNOUG  FAIRBANKS,  JR.,  has  grown  a 
•^"'moustache  for  his  new  picture  "Revolt," 
and  he  likes  it  so  well  he's  considering  making 
it   a    permanent    institution. 

He  looks  five  years  older  and  very,  very 
man-about-town. 

"JUTAYOR    JIMMY    WALKER    of 
New   York   wrote    to   his   good 
friend  Polly  Moran,  asking  for  an 
autographed  photo. 

Polly  sent  it  by  return  mail  with 
this  inscription:  "To  Jimmy — From 
Miss  America  of  1880." 

T  HAD  to  rub  my  old  eyes-and  look  twice  at 
the  twelve  "  bit"  players  who  served  on  the 
jury  in  "The  Trial  of  Yivienne  Ware."  One  of 
them  was  Florence  Turner,  who  twenty  years 
ago  was  one  of  the  most  popular  stars  of  the 
screen. 

CPEAKING  of  the  ups  and  downs  of  this 
^business,  Betty  Compson,  who  became 
famous  overnight  for  her  splendid  performance 
in  the  silent  version  of  "The  Miracle  Man." 
has  been  playing  in  a  vaudeville  skit  at  a 
Chicago  theater  featuring  the  new  talkie 
version  of  "The  Miracle  Man."  A  com- 
paratively new  star,  Sylvia  Sidney,  has  her 
prized  role  and  the  electric  light  honors.

this  vital  question  .  .  .  because

Can't  blame  her  for  decking  out 
that  neat  little  foot  in  a  good- 
looking  shoe!  But  people  always 
have  considered  and  always  will  con- 
sider a.  face  more  important  than  a.  foot! 

If  she  doesn't  do  something  to  get 
those  soft  gums  firm  and  healthy, 
there  may  come  a  day,  and  soon, 
when  she'll  be  afraid  to  smile! 

Think  this  over:  gums  need  stim- 
ulation—  they  need  work.  But  the 
foods  of  this  day  and  age  allow  them 


IPANA 


to  sit  idle.  Gradually  they  lose  their 
firmness.  The  walls  weaken.  There's  a 
trace  of  "pink"  on  your  toothbrush. 

And  "pink  tooth  brush"  tends  to 
make  the  teeth  "foggy"  —  ugly.  It 
often  leads  to  gum  troubles  as  serious 
as  gingivitis  and  Vincent's  disease. 
(Sometimes  even  to  the  dread  but  far 
less  frequent  pyorrhea!)  And  it  can 
threaten  the  soundness  of  your  teeth. 

Don't  let  "pink  tooth  brush"  go 
on  and  on.  Get  a  tube  of  Ipana  Tooth 
Paste.  Clean  your  teeth  with  it. 
(Ipana  is  first  of  all  a  splendid  mod- 


\J 


■  «*■*?*-. 


ern  tooth  paste,  and  cleans  the  teeth 
thoroughly  and  brightens  them.) 

Each  time  you  clean  your  teeth, 
put  a  little  extra  Ipana  on  your  brush 
and  rub  it  into  your  gums.  Don't  rinse 
it  off.  For  there's  ziratol  in  Ipana, 
and  this  splendid  toning  agent  aids 
the  massage  in  bringing  the  gums 
back  to  healthy  hardness. 

Use  Ipana  with  massage  regularly 
— and  you  won't  be  bothered  with 
"pink  tooth  brush."  You'll  be 
through  with  it.  And  your  smile  will 
still   be  attractive  years  from  now!

Talks  Back 


When  the  audience  speaks  the  stars  and  producers  listen.  We  offer  three  prizes  for  the 
best  letters  of  the  month — $25,  $10  and  $5.  Literary  ability  doesn't  count.  But  candid 
opinions  and  constructive  suggestions  do.  We  must  reserve  the  right  to  cut  letters  to 
suit  space  limitations.    Address  The  Editor,  PHOTOPLAY,  221  W.  57th  St,  New  York  City. 


Here's  the  new  Garbo  of  "As 
You  Desire  Me" — a  sweet, 
young  girl,  except  in  the  dra- 
matic earlier  scenes.  One  let- 
ter-writer said  that,  for  the  first 
time,  she  felt  that  Garbo  war- 
ranted the  adjective  "lovable." 
Others  say  this  boy  Melvyn 
Douglas  has  the  stuff  of  which 
great  screen  lovers  are  made 


THE  $25  LETTER 

When  Mickey  Mouse  or  any  one  of  the  black 
and  white  classics  flashes  gaily  upon  the 
screen,  there  is  applause.  That  is  as  it  should  be. 
Our  lives  are  too  matter-of-fact.  We  know  too 
much.  We're  sure  of  what  is  and  what  isn't 
and  when  that  happens,  people  are  likely  to 


lose  something  valuable,  some  imaginative,  fan- 
ciful humor,  or  whatever  used  to  make  us  be- 
lieve in  Alice  in  Wonderland. 

Watching  the  cartoons,  I  believe  in  their 
whimsical  impossibilities.  Mickey  Mouse  and 
his  agile  friends  live  in  a  world  where  anything 
can  happen — where  the  most  astonishing  things 
are  accomplished  with  the  turn  of  a  wrist — in 
a  gay  world  without  subtlety  or  half-tones. 
Everything  ends  satisfactorily — the  villains 
sent  beyond  the  horizon  and  the  lovers  to  an 
obviously  rosy  future — until  next  week! 

Robert  Henderson,  Urbana,  111. 

THE  $10  LETTER 

I  should  like  to  defend  the  theaters.  Many 
of  the  letters  you  publish  condemn  theaters  for 
showing  sex  pictures,  yet  the  people  who  write 
these  letters  cause  this  type  of  picture  to  be 
box-oflice,  while  many  worthwhile  films  play 
to  empty  houses.  The  man  in  the  clothing 
business  buys  two-button  suits  because  they 
are  in  demand.  The  theater  manager  buys 
lurid  pictures  because  the  public  wants  to  see 
them. 

I  believe  the  finest  picture  ever  made  was 
"  Outward  Bound.  "  The  audience?  Well,  in 
our  theater  it  walked  out  and  told  others  that 
the  picture  was  terrible.  If  the  public  would 
patronize  good  films,  the  companies  would 
oblige  by  making  good  films.  As  long  as  the 
public  wants  the  sex  stuff — that's  what  it  will 
get. 

Alvix  Hammel,  Mgr.  Capitol  Theater, 
Frankfort,  Ky. 

THE  $5  LETTER 

I  wish  the  producers  would  give  us,  for  once : 

A  football  captain  who  is  not  a  living  Adonis. 

A  private  secretary  neither  fifty,  spectacled 
and  precise,  nor  blonde,  languorous  and  ap- 
pealing. 

A  married  couple  actually  playing  the  game 
by  its  rules. 

A  successful  financier  without  a  wayward 
son  to  be  set  straight. 

A  young  person  who  doesn't  run  wild  on 
every  occasion. 

A  poor  maiden  aunt  really  welcomed  by 
newlyweds. 

A  flyer  who  doesn't  crack  up  after  his  girl 
has  turned  him  down. 

A  criminal  that  a  pretty  girl  can't  reform. 

In  short,  give  us  natural,  realistic,  could- 
happen-anywhere  pictures. 

Shirley  Braxsont,  Elida,  Ohio 

PLEAS  FOR  NATURALNESS 

I  consider  Joan  Crawford  one  of  the  most 
capable  young  actresses  on  the  screen  today. 
She  has  a  charming  voice,  excellent  enuncia- 
tion, a  decided  flare  for  wearing  clothes,  and 
she  acts  with  great  feeling  and  understanding. 
But  her  eye  and  mouth  make-up  on  the  screen 
are  bad,  and  her  eyebrows  are  much  too  thin 
for  such  large  eyes.  In  the  reel  showing  the 
stars  arriving  at  the  opening  of  "  Grand  Hotel " 
in  Hollywood,  I  particularly  noticed  how  dif- 
ferent Miss  Cra"wford's  eyes  and  mouth  looked 
in  real  life  and  how  much  more  attractive. 
A.  Ward,  San  Francisco,  Calif. 

It  is  heart-breaking  to  find  our  one-time  idol- 
ized Joan  Crawford  changing.  Why,  oh,  why 
does  she  join  the  ranks  of  the  painted  and 


plucked  faces  of  Carole  Lombard,  Garbo,  Do- 
lores Del  Rio  and  others  of  that  type,  when 
formerly  she  was  naturally  perfect  and  beauti- 
ful, soft  and  alluring?  Please  be  yourself,  Joan, 
and  remain  our  ideal. 

Imogi        I'        stedt,  San  Diego,  Calif. 

"LETTY  LYNTON" 

I've  seen  "Letty  Lynton" — wonderful 
actors,  Joan  Crawford  never  more  alluring; 
Robert  Montgomery,  appealing  as  always;  Nils 
Asther  breathlessly  handsome;  Louise  Closser 
Hale  perfect  in  her  part.  But  our  favorite 
actors  are  made  to  run  the  gamut  of  the  sins — 
illicit  love  affair,  lying  (and  oh,  what  lying 
and  how  it  was  enjoyed  by  all!)  and  murder, 
only  to  come  out  gloriously  triumphant  in  the 
final  happy  fade-out. 

Apparently,  reaping  what  one  has  sown,  pun- 
ishment and  retribution  just  don't  follow  any 
more.  Only  the  villain  got  his  and  he  didn't 
care  much,  anyway. 

How  may  we  train  our  young  things  toward 
right  thinking  when  our  finest  pictures  teach 
lessons  like  these? 

Jesse  E.  Word,  Houston,  Texas 

The  acting  of  Joan  Crawford  and  Robert 
Montgomery  in  "Letty  Lynton"  was  superb, 
but  why  such  a  story?  In  real  life  no  man,  no 
matter  how  dissipated  he  may  be  or  has  been, 
would  really  and  truly  take  to  his  heart  and 
into  his  home  the  kind  of  woman  that  Letty 
Lynton  confesses  she  is. 

Winifred  Payxe,  Lynchburg,  Va. 

Nils  Asther  was  splendid  in  "  Letty  Lynton. " 
We  have  been  waiting  for  him  for  so  long.  He 
is  certainly  just  as  handsome  as  ever  and  his 
accent  only  adds  to  his  magnificence. 

Edith  Czarazyxik,  Buffalo,  N.  Y. 

Congratulations  to  Robert  Montgomery  in 
"Letty  Lynton, "  but  let's  have  a  little  less 
sham  from  Joan  Crawford.  I  think  the  major- 
ity of  people  do  not  like  their  dream  world  so 
fantastic. 

H.  Lee  Crooks,  "Sauna,  Kansas 

MORE  GRIST  FOR  THE  MILL 

The  producers  are  continually  searching  for 
new  themes  while  right  under  their  noses  is 
material  that  could  be  used  to  make  one  of  the 
greatest  pictures  of  this  or  any  other  year — 
the  effect  the  present  economic  situation  has 
upon  the  citizens  of  our  country.  W7hy  not 
show  a  picture  presenting  real  people  of  the 
poorer  and  middle  class,  without  any  maudlin 
sentiment — a  picture  about  the  depression.  It 
would  show  beauty,  tragedy,  pain,  humor, 
greed  and  sacrifice. 

V.  Croxburg,  San  Diego,  Calif. 

MAYBE  SHE  WON'T  LEAVE 

To  those  of  us  who  worship  Garbo,  her  hap- 
piness is  our  dearest  wish.  After  all,  Garbo's 
genius  can  carry  her  to  greater  heights  than 
Hollywood  can  ever  offer  her.  If  it  is  true  that 
we  can  no  longer  hope  to  have  her  with  us 
and  that  we  must  learn  to  be  content  with  the 
brief  years  of  exquisite  happiness  she  has  given 
us.  we  should  like  her  to  know  that  our  sincer- 
est  prayers  for  her  success  and  happiness  will 
follow  her  wherever  she  may  go. 

Mrs.  J.  F.  Coxxolly,  Brooklyn,  N.  Y.

Greta  Garbo  is  my  favorite  actress  but  I 
hope  she  leaves  the  screen  forever  right  now. 
For  I  would  rather  forego  ever  seeing  her  again 
than  live  to  know  the  day  when  the  public  is 
tired  of  her.  I  want  to  remember  Garbo  as 
she  is  now,  Garbo  at  the  height  of  her  glory, 
and  I  do  not  want  to  see  her  a  flop  and  laughed 
at  by  the  public  that  once  loved  her.  Oh,  it 
will  happen  if  she  stays! 

Fraser  Macdoxald,  Edmonton,  Canada 

GARBO  CONVERTS 

I  had  begun  to  consider  myself  deaf,  dumb 
and  blind  for  I  could  not,  for  the  life  of  me, 
see  anything  appealing  in  Garbo.  I  saw  all 
her  pictures,  too.  "Mata  Hari"  was,  in  my 
estimation,  the  worst,  and  I  was  surprised 
that  a  man  of  Ramon  Novarro's  ability  would 
co-star  in  such  a  flop.  It  wasn't  until  "As 
You  Desire  Me"  that  I  finally  woke  up  and 
found  what  I  had  been  missing  all  along. 

La  Garbo  forgot  to  be  bored  in  this  pic- 
ture and  cleverly  and  sympathetically  created 
a  personality  that  worked  havoc  with  one's 
emotions.     It  was  a  wonderful  picture. 

Marion  Hennessy,  St.  Louis,  Mo. 

The  great  Garbo  has  achieved  new  heights 
in  "As  You  Desire  Me."  I  had  feared  that 
the  Swedish  actress  was  incapable  of  uttering 
more  than  three  consecutive  English  words  in 
those  thrilling  guttural  tones,  but  she  fooled 
me  by  engaging  in  entire  conversations  which 
sparkled  with  her  delightfully  accented  English. 
But  it  was  her  skilful  portrayal  of  the  two 
sides  of  a  woman's  character  which  astounded 
me.  Garbo  has  always  been  dangerous  and 
glamorous  on  the  screen  but  never  before  could 
I  have  applied  the  adjective  "lovable"  to  her. 
Rachel  Gooden,  St.  Paul,  Minn. 

KEEP  SWEET,  JANET 

What's  the  matter  with  Janet  Gaynor?  Since 
when  did  she  begin  to  think  that  she  can  turn 
down  the  roles  that  made  her  a  star?  She's  not 
a  dramatic  actress  and  it's  about  time  that  she 


NOW,  here's  a  funny  thing.  The 
two  most  discussed  stars  this 
month  were  Joan  Crawford  and 
Greta  Garbo.  Garbo  was  cheered 
for  going  sweet  and  simple  in  parts 
of  "As  You  Desire  Me,"  while 
Crawford  was  begged  to  go  a  little 
less  glamorous  in  her  next  picture. 
The  folks  liked  "Letty  Lynton"  but 
they  wished  Joan  wouldn't  use  so 
much  eye  and  mouth  make-up.  If 
you've  any  doubt  that  it's  sweetness 
and  light  that's  wanted  these  days, 
just  glance  over  the  letters.  Even 
Janet  Gaynor  came  in  for  her  share 
of  criticism  because  she  had  ex- 
pressed the  desire  to  get  away  from 
her  usual  type  of  role.  Naturalness, 
reality,  simplicity — that's  the  cry 
from  the  real  star-makers — the  pub- 
lic. 

With  "Tarzan,  the  Ape  Man"  now 
many  months  old,  Johnny  Weiss- 
muller  is  still  head  boy  among  the 
girls,  with  George  Brent  running 
him  a  close  second  because  of  his 
work  in  "The  Rich  Are  Always 
With  Us."  Incidentally,  Ruth  Chat- 
terton  is  back  as  the  First  Lady  of 
the  Cinema  because  of  her  gay, 
brittle  performance  in  that  film. 

And  how  do  you  feel  about  all 
this? 


realizes  that  the  public  wants  her  in  Pollyanna 
type  parts.  We  think  of  her  as  a  nice  little 
girl  with  high  ideals  and  we  don't  want  to  see 
her  change. 

Marion  Morcou,  Oakland,  Calif. 

GOOD  GROOMING  HINTS 

After  a  woman  is  married  and  in  the  whirl 
of  a  million  duties  it  is  very  easy  to  neglect 
herself.  And  she  wonders  why  her  husband 
loses  interest. 

When  we  attend  the  movies,  we  see  well 
groomed  women  and  they  give  us  the  desire 
to  improve.  Photoplay  gives  us  all  sorts  of 
hints.  I  believe  it  would  make  many  homes 
happier  if  more  women  followed  Photoplay's 
advice. 

Mrs.  Earle  Millhollin,  Omaha,  Neb. 

RUTH  AND  "THE  RICH" 

Anyone  who  thinks  that  Ruth  Chatterton  is 
slipping  should  go  to  see  "  The  Rich  Are  Always 
With  Us."  Her  performance  is  real,  warm 
and  moving — simply  superb. 

I  also  liked  George  Brent.    And  why  people 

call  him  a  second  Clark  Gable  I  do  not  know, 

since  his  acting  ability  is  much  greater  than 

Gable's  and  almost  all  of  our  younger  actors. 

Fredric  Morley,  Brooklyn,  N.  Y. 

I've  seen  "The  Rich  Are  Always  With  Us" 
three  times  and  liked  it  better  each  time. 
Eleanor  Kirbley,  Beverly  Hills,  Calif. 

"The  Rich  Are  Always  With  Us"  brings  a 
new  public  to  the  feet  of  Ruth  Chatterton. 
Rubye  Mae  Fisher,  New  York  City 

Ruth  Chatterton  is  one  of  the  few  actresses 
who  can  play  polite  comedy  without  looking 
like  a  country  bumpkin  at  her  first  party. 
Marle  Thomas,  Baltimore,  Md. 

"The  Rich  Are  Always  With  Us"  is  the 
snappiest  picture  that  has  hit  this  old  town  for 
months.  And  Ruth  Chatterton's  last  three  or 
four  atrocities  are  dead  and  buried  as  far  as  I'm 
concerned. 

Ronald  Tate,  Toronto,  Canada 

Every  time  Ruth  Chatterton  makes  a  new 
picture  she  gets  a  lot  of  ballyhoo  and  I  think, 
"Well,  perhaps  this  time  I  will  see  a  marvelous 
picture."  I  just  saw  her  in  "The  Rich  Are 
Always  With  Us.  "  The  only  one  who  deserves 
any  praise  is  Bette  Davis.  Give  us  more  Davis 
and  less  Chatterton. 

Mrs.  S.  D.  Copeland,  New  Orleans,  La. 

BE  BEAUTIFUL,  BOYS 

Why  can't  we  have  good  looking  leading 
men  occasionally?  The  women  are  more  beau- 
tiful than  ever,  but  I  have  grown  so  tired  of 
seeing  ugly,  uninteresting,  unromantic  men 
without  individuality  or  appeal.  Why  can't  we 
see  more  of  John  Boles,  Ricardo  Cortez  and 
others  of  that  type,  instead  of  what  we  do  have 
to  look  at? 

Marian  White,  Lexington,  Ky. 

MARIE,  WALLY  AND  JACKIE 

The  only  movie  actors  that  stand  out  in  my 
mind  are  Marie  Dressier,  Wallace  Beery  and 
Jackie  Cooper.  The  others  are  an  indiscrimi- 
nate mass  of  standardized  blondes  and  bru- 
nettes with  standardized  emotional  responses. 

I  go  to  the  movies  and  I  like  them,  but  I 
can't  talk  about  Garbo  or  Dietrich  and  Ben- 
nett since  I  could  not  identify  one  of  them. 


Here's  the  new  Crawford — a 
glamorous,  mysterious  woman 
of  the  world.  Although  Joan's 
acting  in  "Letty  Lynton"  got 
raves,  even  her  most  ardent 
admirers  wished  she  would 
bring  more  sweet  simplicity  to 
the  screen.  Nils  Asther  was 
given  a  big  welcome.  Keep  it 
up,  Nils.    The  fans  are  for  you 


Why  do  I  remember  Marie,  Wally  and  Jackie? 
Because  they  are  absolutely  real  without  the 
screen's  conventional  fiub-dub  of  accent,  ges- 
tures and  general  behavior.  I  feel  that  I  really 
know  them  and  that  they  are  real  people,  no 
matter  what  roles  they  play. 

Belle  Taylor,  Baton  Rouge,  La.

A  Formal  Hollywood  Tea 


Many  little  delicacies  is  June 
Clyde's  tea  party  recipe 


June  tactfully  stepped  out  of  this  picture  so  that  your 
gaze  would  not  be  distracted  from  the  food.  Take 
your  position,  please.     A  line  forms  to  the  right! 


WHEN  you  are  bid  to  a  tea  in  Hollywood,  you  ac- 
tually have  tea!     And  not  only  tea  but  delicious 
food  that  sends  you  home  with  no  appetite  what- 
ever for  dinner. 
A  formal  afternoon  tea  in  a  star's  home  is  one  of  the  most 
charming  functions  I  know.     My  most  recent  tea  party  expe- 
rience was  at  June  Clyde's  one  afternoon  not  long  ago.     She  had 
invited  a  large  number  of  her  friends  and  the  food  was  so  de- 
licious that  I  begged  several  special  recipes  to  pass  on  to  you. 
June  had  the  refectory  table  in  her  dining  room  set  beauti- 
fully.   A  magnificent  lace  cloth  covered  the  table;  tulips  and 
spring  flowers  made  a  colorful  centerpiece.     But  the  real  eye 
tempter  was  this  tea  menu: 

Open  Sandwiches  Potato  Chips  Stuffed  Hard  Rolls 

Fancy  Cup  Cakes  Cookies 

Cocoanut  Cake  Chocolate  Cake  Caramel  Cake 

Danish  Buns  Sugared  Jelly  Doughnuts 

Bon  Bons  Assorted  Nuts  Mints 

Tea  Coffee 

The  open  sandwiches  were  attractively  spread  out  oji  several 
large  platters.  There  were  rolled  watercress  sandwiches, 
squares  of  wholewheat  bread  spread  with  thin  slices  of  smoked 
salmon,  white  bread  cut  circular  with  a  spread  of  cream  cheese 
and  garnishment  of  caviar  and 
egg  yolk.  A  novel  idea  was 
French  rolls,  small  and  round, 
cut  in  half  and  filled  with  chicken 
salad. 

Watercress  Rolled  Sandwiches 
— these  would  make  a  delicious 
sandwich  for  informal  afternoon 
tea.  For  the  spread  cream  to- 
gether Yi  cup  of  butter  and  % 
cup  of  finely  ground  watercress. 
To  this  add  \i  teaspoon  salt,  J^ 
tablespoon  lemon  juice  and  a 
few  drops  of  tabasco  sauce. 
Spread  this  thinly  on  squares  of 
very  fresh  white  bread  from 
which  the  crusts  have  been  re- 
moved. Fold  into  a  roll  and  place 
a  sprig  of  watercress  in  each  end. 


Three  favorite  large  cakes  were  placed  on  silver  plates.  A 
devil's  food  cake  had  a  fudge  frosting  and  the  two  white  cakes 
were  iced  with  cocoanut  and  caramel  respectively.  Two  dishes 
of  the  most  delicious  cookies  caught  my  fancy  so  I  asked  for 
the  recipe.  They  were  orange  drop  cookies  I  discovered.  Here's 
how  you  make  them. 

Orange  Drop  Cookies 


2  tablespoons  grated  orange  rind 
4  tablespoons  butter 

1  cup  sugar 

2  eggs

4  tablespoons  orange  juice 
2  cups  sifted  flour 
4  teaspoons  baking  powder 
Vl  teaspoon  salt 

Cream  together  the  grated  orange  rind,  butter  and  sugar. 
Add  the  orange  juice  and  eggs  well-beaten.  Add  also  the  flour, 
baking  powder  and  salt  which  have  been  sifted  together.  Drop 
the  batter  by  spoonsful  onto  a  greased  baking  sheet.  Bake  in 
a  moderately  hot  oven  for  about  ten  minutes. 

If  you  will  notice  the  menu  list,  you  will  see  that  June  has 
used  quite  a  bit  of  originality  in  planning  it.  Such  sturdy, 
old-fashioned  things  as  doughnuts  and  buns  are  included  with 
the  more  elaborate  cakes  and  sandwiches.  And  I  think  includ- 
ing potato  chips  is  an  unusually  happy  thought.  They  are  so 
satisfactory  for  nibbling. 

When  you  have  an  attractively  set  table  and  loads  of  good 

tid-bits  such  as  compose  June's 
menu,  a  tea  gives  itself — you 
don't  have  to  worry  about  it. 
And,  incidentally,  a  tea  is  one  of 
the  best  feminine  gestures  in 
paying  off  social  indebtedness. 

Before  finishing  the  tea  sub- 
ject, let  me  mention  marmalade, 
a  special  item  for  your  teas-for- 
two.  Bitter  Mandarin  Marma- 
lade is  delicious  and  easily  made. 
Cut  the  ends  from  oranges,  the 
number  varying  for  the  amount 
you  want.  Slice  and  seed 
oranges,  cover  with  cold  water 
and  bring  to  boil.  Add  as  much 
sugar  as  there  is  pulp  and  liquid. 
Cook  slowly  until  marmalade 
forms  a  soft  ball  in  cold  water.

WITHOUT    DANGER 


The  new  clothes  stress  youthful  curves. 
So  reducing  becomes  popular.  But  short- 
cuts to  less  weight  endanger  health. 
Beware  of  the  so-called  "harmless" 
reducing  pills,  soaps,  medicines,  etc.  So 
often  they  get  their  effects  by  breaking 
down  needed  tissue. 

The  healthful  way  to  reduce  is  to 
control  the  diet — and  get  proper  exer- 
cise. Be  sure  your  meals  contain  the 
"bulk"  required  for  proper  elimination. 

A  pleasant  and  convenient  way  to 
obtain  this  necessary  "bulk"  is  by  eat- 
ing a  delicious  cereal.  Laboratory  tests 
show  Kellogg's  All-Bran  supplies 
"bulk" — also  Vitamin  B  to  help  tone 
the  system.  Its  "bulk"  is  similar  to  that 
of  leafy  vegetables.  All-Bran  is  also 
rich  in  blood-building  iron. 

Two  tablespoonfuls  daily  will  over- 
come most  types  of  faulty  elimination. 
Isn't  this  much  better  than  dosing  your- 
self with  cathartics — so  often  harmful? 

Enjoy  All-Bran    with    milk  or  use 


in  cooked  dishes.  Appetizing  recipes  on 
the  red-and-green  package.  All-Bran 
is  not  fattening.  It  is  recommended 
by  dietitians.  Sold  by  all  grocers.  Made 
by  Kellogg  in  Battle  Creek.

(current    Pictures 


■^  Indicates  photoplay  was  named  as  one  of  the  best  upon  its  month  of  review 


AFTER   TOMORROW— Fox.— You'll   like    this 

because  it  is  clean,  it  lias  charm  and  is  sincerely  acted 
by  Charlie  Farrell  and  Marian  Nixon.    (May) 

AIR  EAGLES — All-Star. —An  amusing  enough 
picture,  but  bigger  and  better  air  films  have  been 
made.     (April) 

•     ALIAS    THE    DOCTOR— First    National  — 
Now  it's  Richard  Barthelmess  who  glorifies  the 
medical  profession.     Rather  gruesome.     (April) 

ALMOST  MARRIED— Fox.— A  competent  cast, 
including  Ralph  Bellamy  and  Violet  Heming  (stage 
star),  struggle  valiantly  with  a  weak  story,  silly 
dialogue  and  careless  direction.     (Feb.) 

AMATEUR  DADDY— Fox.— If  you  can  imagine 
Warner  Baxter  mothering  a  brood  of  orphaned  chil- 
dren you'll  enjoy  this.    Great  for  the  kids.    (May) 

ANYBODY'S  BLONDE— Action  Pictures— Prize- 
fight stuff,  with  some  laughs  and  exciting  moments. 
{Feb.) 

•  ARE  YOU  LISTENING?— M-G-M.— Grand 
stuff  behind  the  scenes  of  a  broadcasting  com- 
pany with  Billy  Haines  doing  a  straight  dramatic 
role  excellently.    Madge  Evans  fine.    (May) 

ARM  OF  THE  LAW,  THE  —  Monogram.  —  A 
bunch  of  gold  diggers  chisel  away  in  a  fair  mystery 
story.  (July) 

.A  ARSENE  LUPIN— M-G-M.— The  two  Barry- 
A  more  boys.  Jack  and  Lionel,  in  a  picture  that 
can't  be  beat  for  superb  acting.  Story  concerns  a 
Parisian  thief  and  the  captain  of  police.  See  this  by- 
all  means.     (March) 

*AS  YOU  DESIRE  ME— M-G-M— Garbo, 
Von  Stroheim  and  Melvyn  Douglas  in  a  fan-

umbia.— Court  room  drama  with  a  surprise  finish 
and  grand  performances  by  Edmund  Lowe  and  Evelyn

AVALANCHE  —  First  Division.  —  The  daredevil 
German  flier,  Ernst  Udet,  who  appeared  in  "White 
Hell."  There  are  gorgeous  mountain  scenic  shots  but 
story  lacks  emotional  quality.  English  dialogue 
stilted.     (June)

workings  of  a  city  police  department — with  Jean 
Harlow  and  Walter  Huston.     (Feb.)

BEHIND  STONE  WALLS— Mayfair  Pictures. — 
An  impetuous  woman  shoots  her  lover.  High  tension 
drama  is  the  result.  Priscilla  Dean  is  the  attractive 
adventuress.  Robert  Elliott  and  Edward  Nugent  are 
fine.      (June) 

BEN  HUR— M-G-M.— Although  filmed  in  1925 
and  dressed  up  in  new  sound  effects,  this  Ramon 
Novarro-Francis  X.  Bushman  picture  is  still  eye- 
filling  and  exciting.     (Feb.) 

BIG  SHOT,  THE— RKO-Pathe.— A  clean  little 
yarn.  Eddie  Quillan  puts  over  startling  business 
deals  and  wins  Maureen  O'Sullivan.    (Feb.) 

BIG  TIMER,  THE— Columbia.— A  prize-fight 
yarn  with  lots  of  laughs.  Ben  Lyon  plays  a  "ham" 
fighter  and  Constance  Cummings  is  the  girl.  Good 
clean  fun.      (June) 

BLONDE  CAPTIVE,  THE— Australian  Expedi-

Australia  until  the  last  reel,  which  is  a  bit  thick.

a  cowboy  in  the  Mexican  Badlands.    (July) 

10

pictures  ever  made,  and  absolutely  authentic.     (July) 

•  BROKEN  LULLABY  —  Paramount.  —  (Re- 
viewed under  title  "The  Man  I  Killed").  A 
poignant  story,  excellently  directed  by  Ernst  Lubitsch, 
and  beautifully  acted  by  Lionel  Barrymore,  Phillips 
Holmes  and  a  great  cast.  Take  your  extra  hanky,  but 
don't  miss  it.     (March) 

BROKEN  WING,  THE— Paramount.— Love  and 
adventure  below  the  Rio  Grande  with  Lupe  Velez, 
Leo  Carrillo  and  Melvyn  Douglas  playing  the  old 
hokum  exceptionally  well.    {May) 

BUT  THE  FLESH  IS  WEAK— M-G-M— So- 
phisticated situations.  Bob  Montgomery  wisecracks 
and  you'll  remember  Heather  Thatcher,  Hollywood's

CAIN — Talking  Picture  Epics. — Although  not  as 
idyllic  as  "Tabu,"  this  modern  Robinson  Crusoe  story- 
is  both  entertaining  and  beautiful.     (March) 

CARELESS  LADY — Fox. — Joan  Bennett  in  a 
charming  comedy  with  good  situations  and  John 
Boles.     (May) 

CARNIVAL  BOAT  — RKO-Pathe.  — Runaway

camp  melodrama  above  the  mediocre.     (May) 

CHARLIE  CHAN'S  CHANCE— Fox.— Warner 
Oland  again  is  spiendid  as  the  whimsical  Oriental 
detective.  But  the  picture  isn't  set  at  a  brisk  enough 
pace.     (March) 

CHEATERS  AT  PLAY— Fox.— Thomas  Meighan 
works  hard  in  an  old-fashioned  story  about  a  reformed 
crook  and  his  long  lost  son.     {May) 


COCK  OF  THE  AIR— United  Artists.— Obviously 
meant  to  be  whimsical,  this  Billie  Dove  story  about 
a  ravishing  war-time  Parisian  beauty  went  haywire 
somewhere  along  the  line.     Pretty  risque.     (Feb.) 

COHENS  AND  KELLYS  IN  HOLLYWOOD— 

Universal. — A  peek  behind  the  Klieg  lights  and  mi- 
crophones.    {May)

dialogue.  Good  performances  by  Lilian  Harvey.  Lil 
Dagover  and  Conrad  Veidt.     (June)

suspense  about  a  boy  accused  of  his  father's  murder.

Film  Foundation. — Propaganda  against  war,  made

Jack    Oakie    turns    in    a    great    performance. 
Miriam  Hopkins  is  the  dime-a-dance  girl.     (May) 

•     DANCE     TEAM— Fox.— Sally     Eilers  and 

Jimmy  Dunn  hit  the  bull's-eye  once  more.  The 

story   is   not   as   gripping   as   "Bad   Girl,"    but  you 
mustn't  miss  those  two  kidsl     (March) 

DECEIVER,  THE— Columbia.— Wicked  deceiver, 
young  girl,  backstage  atmosphere  and  a  murder.  Ian

ing and  interesting.  Elissa  Landi  and  Victor  McLag- 
len.      (May) 

DISCARDED  LOVERS— Tower  Prod.— Fast- 
moving  and  novel  mystery  story.  Natalie  Moorhead 
is  the  vamp  who  pays  the  penalty.  Good  cast  and 
direction.     (June) 

•     DISORDERLY  CONDUCT  —  Fox.  —  Sally 
Eilers  is  teamed  with  Spencer  Tracy  and  it's  a 
fine  idea.    The  whole  family  should  see  it.    (April)

'.  .  .  there  are  often  positively  harmful  ingredients 
in  unknown  and  unreliable  toilet  preparations. ' 


''Irresponsible  manufacturers  produce  toilet  prep- 
arations which  sometimes  are  very  dangerous. 
How  can  you  young  girls,  just  for  the  saving  of  a 
few  pennies,  risk  your  complexions  and  your  health 
by  buying  such  preparations  when  you  can  buy 
reputable,  worthy  products  of  known  quality  in 
any  good  drug  store?" 

♦  ♦  ♦ 

Reputable  manufacturers  spend  thousands  upon 
thousands  of  dollars  upon  the  advertising  of  their 
toilet  preparations.  They  are  in  the  business  of 
establishing  reputations;  and  they  would  not  spend 
these  dollars — unless  they  were  assured  that  their 


products  were  so  good  as  to  deserve  these  reputa- 
tions. 

Occasionally,  irresponsible  and  dishonest  mer- 
chants substitute  unknown  and  undependable 
preparations  upon  the  unwary  buyer. 

And  million  dollar  complexions  are  ruined  for  the 
saving  of  a  quarter. 


We  urge  Photoplay  readers  to  buy  only  reputable, 
worthy  products  of  known  quality — not  to  accept 
the  substitution  of  unknown  and  frequently  harm- 
ful preparations.

and  Jack  Mulhall.      (June) 

LOVE  IS  A  RACKET— First  National.— Doug 
Fairbanks.  Jr.,  as  a  chatter  columnist.  Good  work  by 
Doug,  Frances  Dee  and  Ann  Dvorak,  but  the  story  is 
weak.     (July)

nie Lightner  and  Charles  Butterworth.  Technicolor. 
(Feb.)

An  unusual  theme,  with  George  Arliss  dominating  the

ing work  and  Anita  Page,  as  the  young  mother,  is 
splendid.     Gripping.     (June)

I  PLEASE  TURN  TO  PACE   14  ] 


Orange  juice  to  build  teeth,  Mother 

and  Pepsodent 


to  keep  them  safe! 


It's  not  so  difficult  to 
have  strong,  healthy 
teeth  so  modern  science 
tells  us.  Just  observe  3 
simple  rules. 


\  f 


MINERALS  and  vitamins  make  teeth 
strong  and  hard;  more  resistant 
to  the  enemies  that  cause  decay.  There- 
fore start  with  the  diet  to  have  strong 
healthy  teeth. The  foods  pictured  at 
right  are  highly  beneficial. 

But  diet  alone  is  not  complete  protec- 
tion. In  the  mouth  are  elements  that 
combine  and  form  a  coating  on  teeth 
called  bacterial  plaque  or  film.  Gelatin- 
like it  sticks  stubbornly  to  teeth.  .  .and 
absorbs  ugly  stains  from  food  and  smok- 
ing. This  film  is  laden  with  germs — acid- 
producing  germs  —  that  dissolve  tooth 
enamel.  Then  they  attack  the  softer  part 
beneath  and  finally  reach  the  nerve.  Pro- 
tecting teeth  means  removing  film — for 
film  is  the  source  of  more  tooth  trouble 
than  any  other  single  thing. 

The  film-removing  power  of 
Pepsodent  is  unique — made  possible  by 
a  newly  discovered  cleansing  and  polish- 
ing material.  This  remarkable  material 


1.  Remove  film — 

use  Pepsodent  toollipaste  every  morning 

and  every  niglit. 

2.  Eat  these  foods— 

one  or  tiro  eggs, 
raw  fruit,  fresh 

vegetables,  lettuce, 
cabbage  or  celery, 
one-half  lemon 
with  orange  juice. 
Onequarlofmilk, 
and  other  food  to 
suit  the  taste. 

3.  See  your  dentist — 

at  least  twice  a 
year.  He  can  de- 
tecttlie  beginning 

of  trouble.  He  can 
slop  it  then  at 
small  expense  and 
no  discomfort. 


is  contained  in  Pepsodent  exclusively 
and  in  no  other  toothpaste  on  the  mar- 
ket. As  it  removes  film  this  new  mate- 
rial polishes  the  enamel  to  high  brilliance. 
More  important  still,  it  is  safer — safer 
because  it's  two  times  softer  than  the 
polishing  material  commonly  used  in 
toothpastes.  Safe  even  for  infant's  teeth 
and  tender  gums. 


Amos  'n'  Andy  are  brought  to  you  by  Pepsodent  every  night  except  Sunday  over  N.  B.  C.  network 

USE   PEPSODENT  TWICE  A   DAY- 
SEE  YOUR    DENTIST  AT   LEAST  TWICE  A  YEAR 


Brief  Reviews  of  Current  Pictures 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  13  ) 


NO  ONE  MAN  —  Paramount.  —  Sumptuous 
clothes,  gorgeous  sets,  smooth  direction.  Carole 
Lombard  and  Paul  Lukas  almost  make  up  for  the 
tottering  plot.     (March) 

•  ONE  HOUR  WITH  YOU— Paramount.— A 
Ray.  naughty  farce  with  Maurice  Chevalier  and 
Jeanette  MacDonald.  It  has  music  and  grand 
Lubitsch  touches.     [April) 

PANAMA  FLO— RKO-Pathe.— Different  situa- 
tions went  haywire  in  a  potpourri  of  speakeasies, 
honkey-tonks  and  jungles.  So  what  could  Helen 
Twelvetrees  and  Charlie  Bickford  do?     (March) 

•  PASSIONATE  PLUMBER,  THE— M-G-M. 
— This  couldn't  be  crazier,  but  it's  as  funny  as 
it's  crazy.  Buster  Keaton  and  Jimmy  Durante. 
(April) 

PLAY  GIRL— Warners.— Loretta  Young  and 
Norman  Poster  in  an  entertaining  enough  play  that 
tries  to  settle  this  marriage-or-career-business,  but 
doesn't.      (May) 

POCATELLO  KID,  THE— Tiffany  Prod.— Ken 
Maynard  in  another  Wild  Western  setting;  Marceline 
D.iy.  the  lady  in  distress.    (Feb.) 

POLICE  COURT— Monogram.— This  old-time 
melodrama  creaks  wearily  across  the  screen.  A  fath- 
er-and-son  yarn,  with  Henry  B.  Walthall,  Aileen 
Pringle  and  King  Baggott.      (June) 

POLLY    OF   THE  CIRCUS— M-G-M— Marion 

Davies  and  Clark  Gable  in  a  modernized  version  of  an 
old  favorite.     (April) 

PRESTIGE  —  RKO-Pathe.  —  Ann  Harding  is 
lovely,  which  doesn't  quite  compensate  for  this  hap- 
hazard yarn  about  a  tropical  penal  colony.     (March) 

•  PRIVATE  LIVES— M-G-M— Norma  Shearer 
and  Bob  Montgomery  do  good  team  work  in 
this  farce  made  amusing  by  priceless,  if  risque,  lines. 
You  one  hundred  per  cent  sophisticates  will  have 
yourselves  a  fling.    (Feb.) 

PROBATION— Chesterfield.  — If  you've  been 
shopping  around  for  a  quiet  little  love  story,  here  it  is. 
Johnny  Darrow,  in  love  with  Sally  Blane,  is  grand. 
Then  there  is  J.  Farrell  MacDonald  and  Clara  Kim- 
ball Young.      (June) 

•      RADIO    PATROL— Universal.— The   glorifi- 
cation of  the  police — with  thrills,  suspense  and 
a  new  idea.    Lila  Lee  and  Robert  Armstrong.     (July) 

RAINBOW  TRAIL.— Fox.— George  O'Brien  tries 
to  make  a  weak  Western  come  to  life.    (Feb.) 

RICH  ARE  ALWAYS  WITH  US,  THE— First 
National. — A  gay  story  and  such  a  relief  after  the  re- 
cent heavy  Chatterton  dramas.  Ruth  is  the  deserted 
wife  in  this,  still  interested  in  the  deserter.  George 
Brent,  excellent.  Bette  Davis  and  John  Miljan  both 
good.     (June)

— Grand  old  Western  hokum  with  Tom  Mix  and  his

Moscow  into  able  citizens.  Russian  dialogue  with 
English  titles.     [April) 

RONNY — UFA. — German  operetta  with  pleasant 
music  and  a  handsome  hero  and  heroine  in  Willy 
Kritsch  and  Kaethe  von  Nagy.  English  captions  aid 
those  who  do  not  know  German.     (June) 

ROADHOUSE  MURDER— Radio  Pictures.— 
Sincere  acting  by  Eric  Linden  and  Dorothy  Jordan, 
but  this  newspaper  story  has  one  of  the  silliest  plots  of 
the  season.     (July) 

SADDLE  BUSTER,  THE  —  RKO-Pathe.  —  A 
Western  without  a  shot  tired.     (April)

A  story  of  high-class  crooks.  Entertaining  enough. 
(April) 

SCANDAL  FOR  SALE  — Universal.  — Another 
newspaper  story.  Charles  Bickford  makes  the  role 
of  editor  believable.  Rose  Hobart  plays  his  wife. 
From  the  novel  "Hot  News."  Good  entertainment. 
(June) 

*  SC A  RFACE— United  Artists.— The  gangster 
picture  of  all  time.  A  masterpiece  that  belongs 
to  no  cycle.  Horrible  and  fearless,  with  Paul  Muni 
in  one  of  the  great  chaiacterizations  of  the  screen. 
(May) 


SECRET  WITNESS,  THE— Columbia.— ZaSu 
Pitts  as  a  flustered  telephone  operator  adds  her  usual 
deft  humor  to  a  mystery  with  a  double  murder  and  a 
couple  of  suicides.    (Feb.)

tional Pictures. — An  old-fashioned  plot  with  lots  of 
sacrifice  that's  just  too  noble.     (May) 

•  SHANGHAI  EXPRESS  —  Paramount.  — 
Oriental  drama  runs  rampant  with  Marlene 
Dietrich,  Clive  Brook,  Anna  May  Wong  and  Warner 
Oland.     Don't  miss  this  exciting  film.     (April) 

SHE    WANTED    A    MILLIONAIRE— Fox.— A 

bcautv  contest  winner  and  a  mad  millionaire.     Joan 
Bennett.     (April) 

SHOP  ANGEL— Premier  Attractions.— If  you're 
very,  very  romantic  you'll  like  this.     (April) 

SHOPWORN  —  Columbia.  —  Barbara  Stanwyck 
does  good  work,  but  the  picture  doesn't  come  up  to  it. 
A  rich-boy-poor-girl  tale  that  comes  out  all  right  in 
the  end.    Regis  Toomey,  as  the  wealthy  boy.     (June) 

SILENT  WITNESS,  THE— Fox.— A  court-room 
story  that  is  good  enough  for  an  evening.  And  watch 
out  for  this  boy  Lionel  Atwill,  new  to  the  talkies. 
(March) 

SINNERS  IN  THE  SUN— Paramount.— Carole 
Lombard  and  Chester  Morris  in  an  unconvincing  but 
not  unentertaining  story.  And  you  must  see  Carole's 
clothes,  girls.     (July)

join  in  this  hunt 


SINISTER  HANDS— Willis  Kent  Prod.— Tries  to 
be  a  mystery  melodrama,  but  you  won't  get  very 
much  excited.     (July) 

SIN'S  PAY  DAY— Action  Pictures. — All  about  a 
prosecuting  attorney  who  defends  a  gangster.  For- 
rest Stanley  is  the  attorney,  Dorothy  Revier  his  wife 
and  Mickey  McGuire  plays  a  street  waif.     (June) 

SKY  BRIDE — Paramount. — A  swell  picture  with 
aviation  thrills  and  a  dash  of  sentiment.  Richard 
Arlen  and  Jack  Oakie.     (July) 

SKY  DEVILS— United  Artists.— Plenty  of  giggles. 
even  if  you  have  seen  and  heard  those  gags  before. 
The  air  stuff  is  great.     (March) 

SO  BIG — Warners.—  Barbara  Stanwyck  gives  a 
great  individual  performance  but  the  picture  has  not 
the  emotional  kick  of  the  silent  version.     (May) 

SOOKY — Paramount. — Even  if  this  does  resemble 
"Skippy."  without  equalling  its  success,  young  and 
old  will  like  it.  The  gang's  all  there  (Jackie  Cooper, 
Robert  Coogan  and  Jackie  Searl)  with  tears  and 
laughs.   (Feb.) 

STEADY  COMPANY— Universal.— The  romance 
of  a  working  girl  and  a  truck  driver.  June  Clyde, 
Norman  Foster  and  ZaSu  Pitts.     (April) 


•     STATE'S  ATTORNEY  —  Radio  Pictures.  — 
Obviously  built  for  John  Barrymore — but  how 
he  plays  the  part !    Helen  Twelvetrees  is  good.  (July) 

STEPPING  SISTERS— Fox— Louise  Dresser, 
Minna  Gombell  and  Jobyna  Howland  work  hard  as 
hard  can  be  and  get  only  a  few  mild  snickers.      (March) 

STOWAWAY— Universal.— Melodrama  and  talk 
on  a  coastal  freighter  that  wouldn't  matter,  except 
for  Fay  Wray's  beauty.     (May) 

STRANGE  CASE  OF  CLARA  DEANE,  THE— 

Paramount. — A  strong  picture,  but  so  similar  to  "The 
Sin  of  Madelon  Claudet"  that  it  detracts  from  its 
punch.  Cora  Sue  Collins  looms  up  as  one  of  the  few 
great  child  performers.  Frances  Dee  and  Dudley 
Digges  lend  strength  to  the  story.     (June) 

•  STRANGE  LOVE  OF  MOLLY  LOUVAIN, 
THE — -First  National. — Suspense,  humor  and 
heart  interest  adroitly  shaken  together.  Intriguing 
plot.  Ann  Dvorak  and  Lee  Tracy  do  a  swell  job. 
(June) 

STRANGERS  OF  THE  EVENING— Tiffany 
Prod. — Rip-roaring  comedy  combined  with  lots  of 
mystery  and  shudders.     (July) 

STRANGERS  IN  LOVE— Paramount.— An  old 
theme  (one  twin  brother  good,  the  other  bad)  played 
excellently    by    Fredric    March    and    Kay    Francis. 

(April) 

STREET  OF  WOMEN  —  Warners.  —  Roland 
Young's  sprightly  acting  saves  this  story  from  gloom. 
Kay  Francis  is  splendid.     (July) 

STRUGGLE,  THE— United  Artists.— Old  Massa 
D.  W.  Griffith  lias  lost  his  cunning  with  the  mega- 
phone and  this  old-fashioned,  phony,  "Face  on  the 
Barroom  Floor"  melodrama  is  a  sad  spectacle  for 
those  who  remember  "The  Birth  ofaNation."      (Feb.) 

•  SUCCESSFUL  CALAMITY,  A— Warners  — 
Not  the  greatest  George  Arliss  picture,  but  dis- 
tinctly worthwhile.  About  the  problems  of  a  modern 
family.     (July) 

SUNSET  TRAIL,  THE— Tiffany  Prod.— A  blonde 
in  distress.  Ken  Maynard  saves  the  situation  with 
gun  and  fist.     And  there  you  are!     (March) 

•  SYMPHONY  OF  SIX  MILLION— Radio 
Pictures. — A  beautifully  told  story  of  love  and 
sen-ice  for  all  the  family  to  see.  Ricardo  Cortez  is  a 
doctor  in  the  tenement  district,  and  Irene  Dunne  a 
crippled  girl  who  devotes  her  time  to  blind  children. 
(June) 

•  TARZAN,  THE  APE  MAN— M-G-M.— A 
glorified  fairy  tale  that  goes  Trader  Horn  one 
better.  Swimming  champ  Johnny  Weissmuller  is 
Tarzan.     (April) 

TEMPEST— UFA.— Emil  Jannings  fine  in  a  Ger- 
man-made comedy-drama  with  English  titles  that 
help  but  do  not  adequately  explain  the  action.   (May) 

TENDERFOOT,  THE— First  National.— Joe  E. 
Brown  as  a  cowboy  from  Texas  hits  Broadway,  and 
the  laughs  begin.    Weak  story,  but  funny  gags.  (July) 

TEXAS  GUN  FIGHTER— Tiffany  Prod.— Noth- 
ing new  in  this  Western.     (April) 

TEX  TAKES  A  HOLIDAY— Argosy  Prod.— This 
story  of  a  Mexican  cowboy  wanders  here,  there  and

(March) 

THEFT  OF  THE  MONA  LISA,  THE— Tobis  — 
Love  story  of  an  Italian  lad.  German  drama  with 
few  English  titles,  making  the  picture  lack  interest 
for  those  who  do  not  understand  German.     (June) 

•  THIS  IS  THE  NIGHT— Paramount.— This  is 
a  light  and  farcical  interlude  that  moviegoers 
long  for.  Lily  Damita  is  charming  as  is  Thelma 
Todd.  Roland  Young  and  Charles  Ruggles  are  mar- 
velous comedians.    (June) 

THIS  RECKLESS  AGE— Paramount.— In  spite 
of  a  grand  cast  (including  Richard  Bennett)  this  yarn 
came  too  late.    The  jazz  age  is  pretty  cold.    (March) 

THUNDER  BELOW  —  Paramount.  —  Tallulah

actress  of  distinction.  Paul  Lukas,  Ralph  Forbes  and

A  fine  balance  of  drama  and  humor.  Joan 
Bennett  plays  a  lovely  prisoner  accused  of  murder.

feminine  movie-goers.  But  the  laughs  go  to  ZaSu 
Pitts  and  Skeets  Gallagher.     (June) 

TWO  KINDS  OF  WOMEN— Paramount.— 
Miriam  Hopkins  is  in  it.  So  is  Phillips  Holmes.  The

•  TWO  SECONDS— First  National.— If  you 
don't  like  your  drama  full  measure,  don't  see 
this.  The  story  of  what  passes  through  a  man's  mind 
in  the  last  two  seconds  he  is  conscious  before  electro- 
cution. Edward  Robinson's  work  is  memorable  and 
the  beauty  of  Vivienne  Osborne  impressive.      (June) 

TWO  SOULS  (Zwei  Menschenl— Cicero  Prod- 
Heavy  drama  and  bright  spots  in  the  Tyrolese

THE — Sono  Art-World  Wide. — If  you're  a  football 
fan,  you  must  see  this  visual  account  of  one  of  the 
greatest  sports  events  of  all  time.     (March) 

VANITY  FAIR— Allied  Pictures.  — They've 
dressed  Becky  Sharp  up  in  modern  clothes  and  made

you'll  enjoy  the  picture.     (May) 

WAYWARD  —  Paramount.  —  A  lot  of  plots 
wrapped  in  one  celluloid  package.  Nancy  Carroll, 
Richard  Arlen  and  Pauline  Frederick.     (April)

M. — The  fine  acting  of  Jackie  Cooper  and  Chic  Sale

is  a  bit  soggy.    Full  of  humor  and  pathos.     (June) 

WHISTLIN'  DAN— Tiffany  Prod.— A  Ken  May- 
nard  Western  with  a  plot  above  the  average.     (May)

Jimmy  Cagney  turns  in  a  fine  characterization  as  a 
prize-fighter.    (July)

sters and  politicians,  but  it  also  has  Claudette  Colbert 
and  Lilyan  Tashman.     (April)

with  a  fair  amount  of  thrills.     (April) 

WOMAN  COMMANDS,  A— RKO-Pathe.—  Pola 

Negri  in  her  comeback  film  is  beautiful  and  alluring, 
but  the  story  is  trite  and  impossible.  See  Pola, 
anyhow.     (Feb.) 

WOMAN  OF  MONTE  CARLO,  THE— First 
National. — Lil  Dagover  bows  to  American  audiences 
in  a  weary,  over-talkative  drama.  Lil  could  do  better

WORLD  AND  THE  FLESH,  THE— Paramount. 
— Against  a  Russian  background  are  set  George  Ban- 
croft and  Miriam  Hopkins.     Mild.     (July) 

WYOMING  WHIRLWIND,  THE— Willis  Kent 
Prod. — A  Lane  Chandler  Western.     (July) 

•  YOUNG  AMERICA— Fox.— This  is  about 
those  youngsters  who  get  the  reputation  for 
being  the  "worst  kids  in  town."  Raymond  Borzage 
steals  the  show.  Doris  Kenyon  has  never  been  love- 
lier, and  Spencer  Tracy  and  Ralph  Bellamy  do  grand 
work.     (June) 

YOUNG  BRIDE— RKO-Pathe.— Eric  Linden  and 
Helen  Twelvetrees  are  better  than  the  story.    (May)

The  audience  asked  for  this  type  of  picture.  "When  a  Feller  Needs  a 
Friend"  was  the  answer,  with  Jackie  Cooper  causing  tears  in  his  scenes 
with  Chic  Sale  and  the  next  minute  knocking  off  grand  comedy  bits. 
"We're  tired  of  sex,  we're  bored  with  crime,"  one  mother  wrote,  "but 
Jackie's  new  picture  is  what  we  want  for  ourselves  and    the  kids"

TAKE  OFF  THE  FRINGE 

Marlene  Dietrich's  eyes  are  beautiful  and  the 
way  she  uses  them,  incomparable.  Even  Garbo 
with  her  "ridiculously  long  lashes"  does  not 
have  a  show  with  la  Dietrich  around.  But  for 
heaven's  sake,  why  does  she  wear  that  lace 
fringe  which  is  supposed  to  be  lashes?  Give 
us  more  of  your  beautiful  eyes,  Marlene,  and 
leave  off  the  fringe. 

Edxa  Ann  Crowe,  Philadelphia,  Penna. 

MORE  STAGE  ACTORS,  PLEASE 

At  a  glance  one  can  recognize  the  well 
trained,  experienced  stage  star.  The  discrimi- 
nating attendant  of  the  movies  is  realizing  more 
and  more  the  importance  of  fine  acting  and  it 
has  been  a  real  treat  to  watch  the  finesse  of  the 
Fontanne-Lunt  team.  Helen  Hayes  and  many 
others.  We're  spoiled  now  and  we  insist  upon 
seeing  these  stage  stars  who  have  achieved  well 
deserved  success. 

Sylvia  Miller,  St.  Louis,  Mo. 

UNCONSCIOUS  SOPHISTICATION 

I  plead  for  more  unconscious  sophistication 
on  the  screen — the  type  of  sophistication  that 
Leslie  Howard  and  Benita  Hume  have  in  "Re- 
served for  Ladies"  and  the  type  that  Marlene 
Dietrich  so  often  hands  us — not  the  Garbo  and 
Crawford  affectation. 

C.  M.  Paris,  W.  Durham,  X.  C. 

DON'T  SAVE  ON  CLOTHES 

I've  read  that  an  attempt  is  being  made  to 
moderate  the  extravagance  of  the  wardrobes 
of  such  stars  as  Garbo.  Crawford,  Shearer  and 
Bennett  because  this  extravagant  splendor  in 
time  of  economic  strain  causes  ill-will  and  dis- 
content among  the  poorer  working  girls.  As 
one  of  this  class.  I  protest. 

16 


We  go  to  the  movies  to  escape  reality;  we 
want  the  illusions  of  splendor  and  costliness  in 
the  clothes  we  see  on  the  stars. 

Dorothy  Lewis,  Cleveland,  Ohio 

JOHNNY'S  STILL  HEAD  MAN 

I  read  the  article  about  Johnny  Weissmuller 
in  the  June  Photoplay  and  I  certainly  agree. 
Any  normal  girl  who  does  not  see  anything  to 
rave  about  in  Johnny  Weissmuller  should  have 
her  head  examined.  It  would  be  such  a  shame- 
to  put  him  in  an  Eskimo  picture  and  hide  his 
wonderful  physique.  Clark  Gable  and  the  rest 
of  the  screen  heroes  can't  compare  with  Johnny. 
Sue  Mori,  Los  Angeles,  Calif. 

GARLE'S  PURLICITY 

Clark  Gable  is  a  good  actor  and  nothing  can 
take  away  his  ability,  but  all  the  asinine  pub- 
licity about  him  is  going  to  ruin  what  Gable 
himself  and  good  stories  have  built  up.  Valen- 
tino was  the  only  man  ever  able  to  buck  such 
publicity  successfully  for  any  length  of  time, 
and  Gable  simply  isn't  that  good.  There  is 
handwriting  on  the  wall  and  I  hope  the  powers 
that  be  see  it  and  do  something  about  it. 

Richard  Gerson,  Hollywood,  Calif. 

HERE'S  YOUR  ANSWER 

If  people  had  any  sense  at  all  they  would 
read  reviews  of  pictures  and  select  a  comedy 
for  blue  days,  a  drama  for  gay  days,  etc.  In- 
stead, they  pick  a  show  at  random  and  then 
rave  because  it  doesn't  suit  the  mood  of  the 
moment.  I  ask  you,  is  that  fair  to  the  movie 
producers  who  honestly  try  to  please  a  fickle 
public? 

Mrs.  C.  0.  Magruder,  San  Diego,  Calif. 

ANOTHER  "TARZAN"  RAVE 

I  think  if  there  were  more  pictures  like  "Tar- 
zan,  the  Ape  Man,"  more  people  would  go  to 


the  talkies.  I  was  enthralled  with  it  and  it  was 
one  of  the  few  pictures  which  I,  my  husband 
and  my  two  little  boys  were  interested  in 
equally. 

There  are  so  few  pictures  that  interest  the 
entire  family.  When  producers  begin  to  con- 
sider the  viewpoint  of  modern  young  mothers 
who  don't  want  their  sons  to  become  gangsters 
or  their  daughters  to  become  fallen  women, 
they'll  give  us  more  pictures  like  "Tarzan." 

It's  such  a  relief  to  sit  through  a  picture 
without  worrying  about  the  children's  morals! 
Mrs.  Esther  L.  Schwartz,  Peekskill,  N.  Y. 

GLAMOROUS  CLOTHES 

In  "As  You  Desire  Me"  Garbo  is  freakishly 
dressed.  All  around  me  I  could  hear  such 
comments  as:  "That  hat!"  "What  a  hair 
dress!"  "Such  necklines!"  Only  once  did  she 
appear  to  have  the  allure  she  would  need  to 
charm  men.  She  can  act,  but  one  almost  loses 
sight  of  that  in  wondering  why  they  don't  al- 
low her  to  appear  charming  always. 

Mrs.  Margaret  Rice,  Indianapolis,  Ind. 

THE  MOST  FAMOUS  DIVORCE 

I  feel  quite  sure  that  were  Harry  Bannister 
to  show  the  potential  star  material  that  Ann 
Harding  has  proved  in  her  pictures,  he  would 
have  been  lifted  to  stardom  in  spite  of  the  re- 
flected glory  in  which  he  has  been  basking — 
just  as  Doug  Fairbanks,  Jr.,  has  been  starred 
notwithstanding  his  wife's  greater  talent.  When 
it  is  apparent  to  everyone  who  has  seen  Ann 
and  Harry  on  the  screen  that  Ann  is  more 
gifted  than  Harry,  the  reason  given  for  their 
divorce  seems  absurd  for  that  condition  would 
have  existed  were  they  never  married  to  each 
other.  Why,  then,  couldn't  they  revel  in  their 
beautiful  love,  and  face  facts? 

Estelle  Bick,  Brooklyn,  NT.  Y. 

I  don't  see  why  the  public  should  get  all 
excited  over  the  Harding-Bannister  divorce. 


"  'The  Rich  Are  Always  With  Us'— and 
may  Ruth  Chatterton  always  be.  I 
hope  she  never  does  another  serious 
drama  when  her  light  comedy  is  so  per- 
fect," reads  one  of  the  many  letters 


speak  their  minds  about  pictures 


Nobody  knows  as  well  as  they  do  what  is  best 
for  themselves  and  I  doubt  if  any  of  their  critics 
could  have  handled  such  an  unhappy  situation 
half  so  well  as  did  Harry  and  Ann. 

Mrs.  George  Jackson,  Ludlow,  Ky. 

LET  'EM  KEEP  TALKING 

I  wish  something  could  be  done  about  the 
censors  in  our  city  and  state.  "  Grand  Hotel" 
was  ruined  by  having  much  conversation  elim- 
inated. When  pictures  are  cut  and  the  dia- 
logue halted,  the  public,  especially  the  younger 
generation,  imagines  things  worse  than  they 
are.  What  a  shame  to  live  in  such  a  large 
and  nice  city  as  Philadelphia  and  know  you 
can't  go  to  see  a  good  picture  without  feeling 
you  have  been  gypped. 
Mrs.  W.  J.  Thompson,  Philadelphia,  Penna. 

FOREIGN  OPINIONS 

There  is  nothing  mysterious  about  Garbo. 
When  at  work  she  is  completely  taken  up  with 
her  role,  as  any  really  good  actress  is.  When 
at  home  she  is  just  a  simple  human  being  who 
loves  to  be  alone  and  wants  to  lead  her  own 
life.  She  is  one  of  the  finest,  sweetest,  most 
natural  girls  in  Hollywood. 

Nina  Corry,  Alassio,  Italy 

Over  here  we  get  such  horrid  plays  in  the 
legitimate  theater  that  we  all  prefer  the  movies. 
Elena  Romana,  Arequipa,  Peru,  S.  A. 

I  think  Norma  Shearer  deserves  all  the  bou- 
quets she  gets.  I  don't  know  of  a  single  actress 
who  is  as  versatile  as  she. 

Val  Halloran,  Suva,  Fiji 

Motion  pictures  have  set  the  styles  of  the 
world.  They  have  taught  us  geography,  his- 
tory, social  conditions  and  politics. 

Julian  La  Torre,  Manila,  P.  I. 


Here  is  an  unusual  motion  picture  that  pulled  in  hundreds  of  letters  of 
praise — mostly  directed  at  the  cameraman.  "The  Doomed  Battalion" 
shows  war  at  its  most  difficult,  in  the  Austrian  Tyrol.  Folks  who  were 
crazy  about  "The  White  Hell  of  Pitz  Palu"  voted  this  to  be  its  truly 
worthy  successor.     The  beauty  and  magnificence  of  the  scenery  scored 


George  Brent  came  in  for  his  share  of  the 
credit  in  making  Ruth's  picture  an  au- 
dience favorite.  But  everybody  agreed 
that  he  must  not  be  compared  with 
Clark   Gable.      Let  him   be  himself! 


Our  great  producers  should  show  vital  prob- 
lems on  the  screen  to  help  us  weather  the  storm 
of  our  present  problems. 

T.  C.  Grant,  Halifax,  N.  S. 

Lewis  Stone  has  a  convincing  charm  and  a 
polish  that  one  immediately  wishes  to  assume. 
His  absolute  freedom  from  theatrical  antics, 
his  superb  characterizations,  his  genuine  breed- 
ing are  so  obvious  and  so  real  that  to  see  him 
sets  a  higher  standard  of  social  conduct. 

A.  V.  Burke,  Vancouver,  B.  C. 

Clark  Gable  is  perfectly  natural.     Besides, 
he  is  a  great  actor  and  extremely  handsome. 
Bourbon  Delmonte,  Paris,  France 

Gangster  films,  sex  films,  newspaper  films 
and  college  films  all  show  a  sordid  and  drab 
atmosphere.  Are  American  films  of  today  a 
true  indication  of  the  temperament  of  the  aver- 
age American  citizen?  As  the  Gaynor-Farrell 
type  of  film  is  rare,  am  I  to  presume  that  clean- 
living,  home-loving  people  are  practically  non- 
existent in  the  towns  of  America? 

Miss  J.  Dyson,  Middlesex,  England 

Like  gods  and  goddesses  of  all  time,  Garbo 
belongs  to  humanity. 

Basil  Frangoulis,  Cairo,  Egypt 

The  motion  picture,  more  than  any  other 
agency,  dispenses  and  interprets  Americanism 
— American  ideas  and  ideals. 

Mrs.  H.  E.  Tomlinson,  Schofield 

Barracks,  Hawaii 

When  will  producers  and  directors  come  to 
realize  that  the  pictures  which  make  the  biggest 
box  office  successes  are  clean,  human  pictures 
which  depict  the  struggles  and  triumphs  and 
often  the  pitiful  failures  of  real  life?  Anyone 
who  doubts  this  statement  is  recommended  to 
study  the  list  of  Photoplay  Gold  Medal  pic- 
ture winners  for  the  past  twelve  years. 

Jeanne  Vllliers-Wardell,  Cannes,  France 


American  films  are  still  vastly  superior  to 
ours,  but  may  I  point  out  to  Hollywood  pro- 
ducers that  all  Englishmen  do  not  speak  with  a 
cockney  accent  and  that  the  sun  has  been 
known  to  shine  in  London.  It's  not  always 
raining. 

H.  J.  Wride,  Birmingham,  England 

Betty  Compson  is  the  most  versatile  actress 
on  the  screen.  I  have  been  her  loyal  fan  for 
over  eighteen  years. 

F.  A.  Howe,  Auckland,  New  Zealand 

PERTINENT  COMMENTS 

Jack  Gilbert  has  a  great  future  before  him 
and  if  he  chooses  he  can  easily  be  the  greatest 
emotional  actor  on  the  screen.  He  is  young, 
handsome,  earnest  and  ambitious  and  I  think 
his  voice  is  decidedly  pleasant. 

E.  Neal,  San  Antonio,  Texas 

In  my  opinion  Jean  Harlow  is  the  most 
glamorous  star  on  the  American  screen  today. 
She  is  so  much  better,  and  has  so  much  more 
sex  appeal  than  Garbo.  I'm  for  Jean  first,  last 
and  all  the  time  and  always  in  bigger  and 
better  roles. 

A.  O.  Miller,  Jr.,  West  Orange,  N.  J. 

Melvyn  Douglas  does  not  act  his  parts,  he 
lives  them.  He  isn't  merely  an  actor  but  an 
artist. 

Mary  Fenel,  Chicago,  111. 

We  need  more  naturalness  from  our  actresses 
— the  kind  given  by  Barbara  Stanwyck  and 
that  grand  Marie  Dressier. 

Myriam  Rosseter,  St.  Petersburg,  Fla. 

I  think  if  a  little  more  pep  and  energy  were 
injected  into  Marlene  Dietrich's  roles  she 
would  be  a  far  greater  success  on  the  American 
screen. 

Edward  J.  Graham,  Philadelphia,  Penna.

What  is  the  meaning  of  these  strange  Arabic 
symbols  written  centuries  ago? 

Surprising  as  it  may  seem,  when  translated 
they   spell   halitosis    (unpleasant   breath). 

The  ancient  Mohammedans  recognized 
what  the  modern  Listerine  advertisements 
have  always  attempted  to  convey — that 
halitosis  is  the  unforgivable  fault. 

So  strongly  did  they  feel  this  that  halitosis 
was  made  one  of  the  four  grounds  on  which 
a  divorce  could  be  obtained. 

It  looks  as  though  the  Mohammedans 
were  smarter  than  we  are  .  .  . 


You — anyone — is  likely  to  have  halitosis 
for  the  reason  that  90%  of  the  trouble  is 
caused  by  tiny  bits  of  food  fermenting  in 
the  mouth. 


But  you  need  never  offend  if  you  use 
Listerine.  Listerine  both  prevents  and  rem- 
edies halitosis  because  of  its  double  action. 

Deodorizes  12  Hours  Longer 

Being  antiseptic,  Listerine  instantly  halts 
fermentation,  the  cause  of  odors.  And  then, 
because  it  is  the  swiftest  deodorant  known, 
it  gets  rid  of  the  odors  themselves. 

Tests  show  that  Listerine  instantly  over- 
comes  odors  that  ordinary  mouth  washes 
cannot  conquer  in  ia  hours  or  more. 

For  Certain  Results — Listerine 

When  you  want  to  be  certain  that  your 
breath  is  beyond  reproach,  and  agreeable  to 
others,  use  only  Listerine.  Don't  take  chances 
with  solutions  of  doubtful  deodorant  power. 


Remember,  Listerine  is  effective  because  it 
attacks  the  cause,  then  removes  the  effect. 
And  its  taste  is  pleasant. 

If  you  haven't  a  bottle  in  your  medicine 
cabinet,  get  one  now. 


Because  of  its  marked  deodorant  power, 
Listerine  is  a  delightful  aid  in  overcoming  an- 
other social  handicap — perspiration  and  other 
body  odors.  A  groat  many  women  and  men 
labor  under  the  delusion  that  the  use  of  mere 
soap  and  water  will  overcome  this  humiliating 
condition.  Nothing  is  further  from  the  truth. 
For  swift  deodorant  effect,  you  must  use  a 
deodorant.  After  your  bath,  simply  apply 
Listerine  to  the  guilty  areas.  It  cleans,  fresh- 
ens, sweetens,  and  deodorizes.  You  go  forth 
feeling  that  you  are  fastidious  and  immaculate.

burning  question  is,  "So  what  about  the  state  of  her 
marriage?"  When  she  moved  into  her  own  home,  which  did

Why  this  easy  LUX  way 

stops  runs  before 
they  start . . . 


$1-  means  a  lot 

and  that's  just 
about  what  it  costs 
me  every  time  a 
stocking  goes  into 
runs!  You  can  be 
sure  I'll  use  the 
Lux  way  of  wash- 
ing from  now  on. 
It's  such  an  easy 
way  to  save  on 
stocking  bills." 


. . .  doubles  the  wear  of  your  stockings 


EVERYWHERE  girls  are  prov- 
'  ing  that  the  Lux  way  of  wash- 
ing actually  prevents  stocking  runs! 
Because  it  preserves  the  elasticitx  stock- 
ings have  when  they're  new. 

You  can  see  for  yourself  how  elastic 
a  new  stocking  is.  Take  the  hem  of 
a  new  pair — see  how  amazingly  it 
stretches— how  quickly  it  springs 
back  into  shape. 

Out  you  can  destro\  this  elas- 
ticity very  easily.    If  you  use  harsh 
soaps — or  it  you 
rub  the  tender 
threads  with   a

which  tends  to 

roughen  and  weaken  them  .  .  elastic- 

3  lost.     The  delicate  threads  lose 

their  live  "springiness" — they  break 


instead  of  giving,  when  they're 
strained.  The  least  little  pull  may 
start  a  costly  run! 

Lux  is  especially 
made  to  preserve 
the  precious  elas- 
ticity of  silk.Those 
soft  Lux  suds  can't 
rob  even  the  sheer- 
est stocking  ot  its 
life!  In  fact,  wash- 
ing with  Lux  (after  every  wearing  if 
possible)  doubles  stocking  wear.  And 
that  means  cutting  stocking  bills 
down  to  halt! 

Wash  this  two-minute  way: 

1.  One  teaspoon  of  I.ux  for  each  pair. 

2.  Add  lukewarm  water  to  Lux,  squeeze  suds 
through  stockings,  rinse  well. 


k*a> 


Don  't  rub  With  Cake  SOOfi.  It  ruins  elas- 
ticity. With  Lux  there's  no  rubbing.  Even  stub- 
born spots  come  out  perfectly  if  you  gently 
press  in  a  few  dry  Lux  diamonds. 

Avoid  ordinary  soaps— cakes,  powders, 

chips.  These  often  contain  harmful  alkali 
which  weakens  silk  threads,  fades  colors.  Lux 
has  no  harmful  alkali.  Anything  safe  in  water 
is  safe  in  Lux. 

Don't  use  too-warm  water— it  fades 

color.  With  Lux  you  use  lukewarm  water.

THE  very  latest  wrinkle  in 
the  fortune  telling  racket  is 
"body  reading." 

The  enterprising  Hollywood 
gentleman  who  inaugurated  this 
idea  gets  a  good-looking  girl  into  a 
corner  at  a  party,  begins  to  read 
her  palm,  then  travels  up  her  arm 
telling  her  from  the  contours  of 

her  elbow,  etc.,  where  she  was  born  and  other  details 
about  herself.  The  girl  is  duly  impressed  by  the 
correctness  of  the  "reading,"  which  derives,  of  course, 
from  the  simple  fact  that  the  "reader"  has  found  out 
about  his  victim  before  the  party. 

Arrived  at  the  shoulder,  the  "reader"  breaks  off  and 
starts  talking  about  the  weather.  And  when  his 
victim  asks  in  alarm  why  he  does  not  go  on  he  explains 
that  he  is  a  "body-reader"  and  cannot  tell  the  future 
correctly  without  seeing  more. 

According  to  reports  the  man's  spiel  is  so  con- 
vincing that  numbers  of  Hollywood's  fairest  and 
loveliest  have  innocently  fallen  for  the  "body-reading" 
gag,  and  actually  paid  him  to  do  it. 

NORMA  SHEARER'S  two-year  old  son  is  ac- 
companied everywhere  by  a  uniformed*  guard 
who  openly  displays  a  huge  automatic  strung  to  his 
belt.  He  is  under  orders  to  remain  within  ten  feet 
of  the  little  fellow  even  when  he  takes  his  afternoon 
nap.  He  calls  the  burly  fellow  "Ga-ga."  Jackie 
Cooper  calls  his  guard  "That  big  bum." 

Almost  every  nursery  in  the  homes  of  the  screen 
notables  is  now  protected  by  barred  windows  and 
burglar  alarms,  and  as  we  told  you  a  few  months  ago 
in  Photoplay,  more  than  a  dozen  of  the  children  of 
the  stars  and  executives  are  guarded  by  gun-toting 
huskies. 

Passing  by  Marlene  Dietrich's  home  the  other  day 
I  was  amazed  to  seethecounty  jail  atmosphere  created 
by  half-inch  steel  bars  decorating  every  window  and 
door.  Ann  Harding's  little  girl  goes  to  an  expensive 
kindergarten  in  Beverly  Hills  and  rides  to  and  fro  in  a 
large  limousine  with  her  two  hundred  pound  guard 
beside  her.  The  other  day  the  little  tots  were  to  be 
taken  out  in  the  nearby  woods  for  a  nature  lesson  and 
the  guard  insisted  on  going  right  along  to  study 
the  birds,  the  trees  and  the  wild  flowers.

ONNIE  BENNETT  was 
giving  a  party  at  her  home 
recently  when  some  of  the  guests 
expressed  a  wish  to  see  her  little 
son,  Peter,  who  was  up  in  his 
nursery  asleep.  Connie  took 
them  upstairs  and  started  to 
open  the  door.  Immediately  she 
touched  the  doorknob  a  series  of 
electric  gongs  started  operation,  the  guests  were 
thrown  into  a  bedlam  of  excitement  and  little  Peter 
yelled  in  terror.  It  seems  that  the  child's  nurse  had 
set  the  alarm  and  failed  to  notify  Connie. 

And  the  day  following  some  of  the  trick  electric  gad- 
gets that  protect  the  Harding  castle  from  intruders 
were  set  off  by  mistake,  bringing  two  squads  of  police 
screaming  up  the  hill  at  sixty  miles  an  hour.  One  of 
the  new  maids  had  ventured  into  the  hallway  out- 
side the  baby's  room  and  touched  a  wire  extending 
across  the  hall  with  her  foot. 

Uneasy  lie  the  heads  that  wear  the  screen  crowns — 
when  they  have  babies  worth  a  king's  ransom. 

ONE  of  the  most  entertaining  pictures  I  have  seen 
in  the  studio  projection  rooms  is  "What  Price 
Hollywood."  When  you  see  it  pay  close  attention  to 
the  wedding  scenes.  It  is  a  satire  on  the  wedding  of 
Vilma  Banky  and  Rod  LaRocque,  and  it  is  no  exag- 
geration of  what  really  happened  in  Hollywood  just  a 
few  years  ago.  The  character  of  the  director  is  also 
taken  from  real  life  by  our  own  Adela  Rogers  St. 
Johns  and  Jane  Murfin,  who  know  their  Hollywood 
and  wrote  the  story. 


WHAT  stars'  names  bring  'em  into  the  theater 
regardless  of  what  picture  they  play  in?  The 
Motion  Picture  Herald,  a  trade  publication,  asked  that 
question  of  thousands  of  exhibitors. 

And  lo,  among  the  ladies  of  the  screen  Marie 
Dressler's  name  stood  above  them  all.  Next  came 
Gaynor,  Crawford,  Garbo,  Shearer,  Sally  Eilers, 
Constance  Bennett,  Marlene  Dietrich,  Barbara  Stan- 
wyck, Ruth  Chatterton,  Ann  Harding,  in  the  order 
named.  Wally  Beery  led  the  men  with  Will  Rogers 
topping  Clark  Gable  and  Maurice  Chevalier.  Buck 
Jones  topped  John  Barrymore  and  the  brand  new 

25 


Johnny  Weissmuller  ran  ahead  of  Ramon  Novarro. 
Martin  Quigley,  who  owns,  and  Terry  Ramsaye, 
who  edits  the  Herald,  arc  square  guys,  but  I  call  for  a 
recount.  My  favorite  star  was  below  Ronald  Col- 
nian,  George  Bancroft  and  William  Powell.  If  I 
could  I  would  stuff  the  ballot  box  for  Mickey  Mouse. 
His  is  the  life.  Always  nutty  and  carefree.  No  bills 
to  pay.  No  work  to  do.  If  a  wolf  showed  up  at  the 
door  he'd  kick  him  over  a  mountain. 

I  DO  not  often  use  these  columns  to  peddle  next 
month's  issue.  But  I  wouldn't  be  on  the  level  with 
you  unless  I  tipped  you  off  as  one  friend  to  another  of 
something  in  store  for  you.  It  is  the  life  and  philoso- 
phy of  my  second  favorite  star,  Marie  Dressier.  I 
had  lunch  with  her  recently,  a  luncheon  that  extended 
through  one  whole  afternoon,  and  I  was  so  fascinated 
by  her  story  and  her  mind  that  I  asked  her  if  she  would 
pass  on  her  experiences  and  her  optimism  to  the 
readers  of  Photoplay.  I  asked  her  to  write  it  and 
offered  to  pay  her  a  high  price  for  it. 

"Jim,"  she  said,  "y°u  should  be  ashamed  of  your- 
self, offering  me  money  to  cheer  folks  up.  Get  right 
out  of  my  house  and  send  Adela  right  over  to  see  me." 

So  Adela  Rogers  St.  Johns,  a  pal  of  Marie's,  and  a 
writer  who  has  been  too  long  absent  from  Photoplay, 
will  write  the  story  for  you.  It  will  be  great  fun  for  me 
to  work  with  Adela  again. 

ONE  of  the  last  exploits  of  Vincent  Barnett, 
Hollywood's  famous  "professional  insulter,"  be- 
fore his  new  Paramount  acting  contract  put  an  end 
to  his  ribbing  activities,  was  the  deliberate  madden- 
ing by  slow  torture  of  Cecil  Beaton,  the  English 
photographer,  at  Joan  Crawford's  party. 

Beginning  with  the  loud  remark,  "This  party  looks 
as  if  it's  going  to  be  lousy — there  are  too  many 
Englishmen  present,"  Barnett  gradually  worked 
Beaton  up  into  the  lather  that  only  an  insulter  of  his 
caliber  can  create. 

After  an  hour  or  two  Heather  Thatcher,  the  English 
actress  with  the  monocle,  got  up  and  coolly  knocked 
Vince  down.  At  this  point  Doug,  Jr.,  decided  it  was 
time  to  take  the  purple-faced  Beaton  aside  and  tell 
him  it  was  all  in  fun.  "He's  insulting  you  just  for  a 
gag,"  said  Doug;  "we're  paying  him  to  do  it." 

Beaton  knit  his  white  brows  for  a  moment,  then 
said  in  a  puzzled  voice:  "Yes — -but  why  does  he  have 
to  say  all  those  horrid  things  about  Englishmen?" 

Repeated  explanations  failed  to  make  Beaton 
understand  the  idea  of  the  "professional  ribber,"  and 
finally  Doug  gave  it  up  in  despair. 

AN  hour  later  Beaton  was  overheard  saying  to 
Barnett:  "If  you  go  on  saying  those  dreadful 
things  I  shall  really  have  to  engage  you  in  a  bout  of 
fisticuffs!" 

Incidentally,  Vince  Barnett  met  his  Waterloo 
when  he  went  to  work  on  Tallulah  Bankhead  at 
another  party.     Tallulah  was  quite  innocent  of  the 

26 


gag,  l)ii t  when  it  comes  to  insulting  she  can  do  as 
pretty  a  job  as  anyone.  Hitting  right  back  at  Vinee, 
insult  for  insult,  she  finally  crushed  him  with  her  foren- 
sic eloquence  and  he  retired,  yielding  her  the  victory. 

WHEN  they  assigned  King  Vidor  to  film  "The 
Bird  of  Paradise,"  he  realized  that  the  famous 
story  of  the  play  had  been  stolen  so  often  for  the  screen 
it  was  more  or  less  necessary  to  write  a  new  one.  The 
only  thing  the  studio  insisted  on  was  that  it  end 
with  the  heroine  throwing  herself  into  the  volcano. 

Making  pictures  in  this  back-to-front  manner  is  a 
conjuring  trick  that  reminds  Vidor  of  the  old  Weber 
and  Fields  gag,  "What  is  the  riddle  that  ends  'because 
she  can't  sit  down'?"  The  answer  being,  "Why  does 
a  hen  lay  an  egg  on  a  hot  stove?" 

That's  just  how  simple  it  is  to  be  a  picture  director 
when  the  studio  insists  on  reviving  one  of  its  moth- 
eaten  stories  for  the  talkies. 

WHAT  a  shock  the  Paramount  executives  got 
recently  when  Mae  West,  whose  high  powered 
sex  dramas  kept  the  New  York  police  busy  for  a  long 
time,  walked  into  their  offices.  They  had  engaged  her 
for  a  picture  in  which  she  was  to  play  a  hefty  Diamond 
Lil  sort  of  character.  Instead  of  a  stout  woman  of 
one  hundred  and  sixty  pounds  such  as  she  appeared 
on  the  New  York  stage,  in  tripped  a  blonde  of  less 
than  one  hundred  nineteen  poundage. 

She  explained  that  in  her  character  she  pads  herself 
to  look  heavy.  She  will  probably  be  pretty  well  fed 
up  on  pictures  after  she  works  through  the  hot  sum- 
mer wearing  enough  padding  to  make  a  mattress. 

JUST  a  few  weeks  ago  I  met  Jean  Harlow  for  the 
first  time.  We  sat  off  in  a  corner  of  one  of  the  sets 
during  the  making  of  "Red-Headed  Woman"  and 
chatted  while  Jack  Conway  was  rehearsing  a  scene 
with  Una  Merkel,  who  plays  her  manicure  girl  chum. 
Again  I  found  how  unreliable  are  impressions  you 
form  of  screen  personalities  from  the  parts  they  play. 

I  was  tremendously  impressed  by  the  quiet  sin- 
cerity, the  agile  mentality,  the  sense  of  humor,  the 
evident  breeding,  the  genuine  personal  charm  of  the 
girl  who  created  the  national  craze  for  platinum  hair. 
Her  mother  and  father  must  be  splendid  folks. 

Leaving  the  studio  I  encountered  my  old  friend, 
Paul  Bern,  one  of  the  higher  executives  of  that  all 
champion  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  production  staff 
that  Louis  B.  Mayer  has  lead  and  inspired  to  motion 
picture  leadership.  Gentle,  humanitarian,  handsome 
Paul  Bern  with  a  heart  so  big  there  has  always  been 
room  for  the  troubles  of  the  less  fortunate.  The  Good 
Samaritan  of  Hollywood,  the  father  confessor  of  the 
sick  of  heart  and  soul,  with  as  clear  and  understanding 
a  mind  as  I  have  ever  known. 

I  have  always  felt  that  you  can  judge  a  woman  by 
the  love  she  inspires  in  a  fine  man.  and  I  can  think  of 
no  greater  tribute  to  Jean  Harlow  than  that  Paul  Bern 
loves  her  and  asked  her  to  be  his  wife. 


"They  might  as  well 
lay  off  the  Rudy  stuff. 
I'll  make  my  way  look- 
ing very  much  like 
George  Raft."  That's 
what  Georgie  believes. 
But  study  this  famous 
picture  of  Rudolph  Val- 
entino,  and  then — 


Look  at  this  shot  of 
George  Raft,  Little  Boy 
of  "Scarface."  Why, 
even  the  photographer 
hangs  the  "Second 
Valentino"  curse  on 
him  by  using  the  same 
lighting  effect  and  pose 
as  Rudy's  picture!

THE  instant  the  gun  of  Paul 
("Scarface")  Munipumped 
death  into  the  middle  of 
George  Raft,  and  he  sank 
slowly  to  the  floor  with  his  lips 
making  soundless  words,  a  new 
screen  sensation  was  born. 

It  was  one  of  the  greatest  vio- 
lent deaths  in  the  lethal  history 
of  pictures.  It  capped  a  mag- 
nificent performance  by  Georgie 
Raft,  and  it  made  him  famous. 

And  with  as  much  astonishment  as  a  veteran  Broadway 
hanger-on  can  muster,  Raft  found  himself  a  blazing  celebrity. 

Feminine  fans  are  agape  and  agog.  Fair  chatter-writers 
fawn  on  Georgie.  Paramount,  kneeling  by  its  trundle  bed 
each  night,  says  a  prayer  of  thanks  that  it  has  him  under 
contract.  Big  parts — wealth — prestige  and  petting — all  these 
are  about  to  pour  upon  the  sleek-haired  ex-hoofer  of  the  New 
York  night  world. 

And  now,  with  the  world  his  big  and  juicy  oyster,  misguided 
folks  are  trying  to  hang  a  jinx  on  Georgie  Raft! 

Just  because  he  greatly  resembles  the  late  lamented  Rudy, 
they  are  labelling  him  "the  new  Valentino!" 

In  short,  mates,  it's  the  old  "Second  Valentino"  curse — the 
old  "Second  Valentino"  curse! 

And  if  one  thing  on  this  screeching  earth  can  wreck,  blast, 
uproot  and  shatter  the  career  of  a  rising  young  picture  star, 
that  label  is  it! 

They  called  Ricardo  Cortez  the  "second  Valentino,"  and  it 
took  him  years  to  throw  off  the  jinx  and  battle  to  the  top  on 
his  own. 

Ramon  Novarro  was  badly  blighted  by  the  tag,  when  he  was 
running  a  poor  second  in  competition  with  the  immortal  Rudy. 

Why,  only  a  year  or  two  ago  a  hand- 
some young  Mexican  named  Jose 
Mojica  floated  into  Hollywood  on  a 
wave  of  tamales,  and  was  hailed  with

way lightly  laughs  it  off

howls  of  acclaim  as  the  new  Rudy. 
The  old  jinx  worked  so  fast  on 
hapless  Jose  that  we  hardly  had  a 
chance  to  look  upon  his  sun- 
tanned shadow  on  the  screen! 

Nope — if  you  want  to  tee- 
totally  ruin  a  young  fellow  zoom- 
ing up  in  pictures,  just  tab  him 
"the  new  Valentino." 

I  caught  Georgie  Raft  in  a  hotel 

suite,  not  long  ago,  and  warned  him 

of  the  doom  that  threatened. 

It  was  filled  with  tobacco  smoke  and  with  journalists  come  to 

do  the  new  find  honor.     I  cut  him,  with  difficulty,  out  of  the 

herd  of  fair  ones  who  surrounded  him.     He  laughed. 

"What  if  I  do  look  like  Valentino?"  said  Georgie,  dodging  a 
feminine  coo.  "People  have  always  said  that.  But  my  picture 
career  is  no  part  of  that.  I'm  strictly  on  my  own,  and  will  play 
any  part  they  give  me,  from  gorilla  to  romantic  lead.  They 
might  as  well  lay  off  the  Rudy  stuff.  I'll  make  my  own  way, 
looking  very  much  like  George  Raft!" 

I  WAS  encouraged,  and  let  the  girls  at  him  again.  He'll  do  all 
right,  that  Raft.  He's  a  tense  hombre!  No  resemblance  to  the 
late  Great  Lover  is  going  to  knock  him  off  the  high  road  and 
out  of  the  big  money  in  which,  to  his  calm  amazement,  he 
finds  himself. 

Drama?  Raft's  rapid  rise  is  broken  out  with  a  rash  of  it! 
He's  the  greatest  He-Cinderella  in  modern  Hollywood — 
though  for  this  he  will  probably  pop  me  on  the  nose  when  he 
sees  me  again.  His  life  parallels,  astonishingly,  the  mortal  career 
of  James  "Dese  and  Dose"  Cagney — though  Jimmy  is  Irish  and 
Raft  of  a  sultrier  race. 

George  was  born  in  "Hell's  Kitchen" — that  tenement  maze 
in  the  vicinity  of  Tent'  Avenoo— and 
Cagney  on  the  lower  East  side  of  N' Yawk. 
Like  Jimmy,  he  drifted  into  dancing, 
became       [  please  turn  to  page  112]

SHADY 


Joan  Crawford  as  Sadie  Thompson  in  "Rain" 
is  at  the  height  of  her  shady  dame  period  in 
that  film,  "Letty  Lynton"  and  "Grand  Ho- 
tel." An  actress  of  great  dramatic  power,  but 
will  she  return  to  peppy,  lovable  roles  again? 


HOLLYWOOD  has  created  a  new  woman,  a  different  type 
of  heroine,  a  unique  feminine  personality.     The  leaders 
of  the  new  school  are  Garbo,  Marlene  Dietrich,  Tallulah 
Bankhead — and  if  you've  seen  "Letty  Lynton" — Joan  Craw- 
ford. 

Girls  younger  at  the  picture  game  than  these  are  following 
suit — Ann  Dvorak,  Karen  Morley,  little  Frances  Dean,  whose 
first  publicity  picture  you  will  find  on  these  pages,  and  many, 
many  others. 

"Glamorous"  and  "mysterious"  have  been  the  adjectives 
that  best  described  these  women  but  it  is  something  more 
than  that,  and  just  how  deep-rooted  it  is,  just  how  many  girls 

28 


and  women  throughout  the  country 
are  taking  these  screen  stars  as 
models,  remains  to  be  seen.  I  wonder 
if  it  is  a  good  or  bad  influence. 

You  will  realize  that  this  new  type 
is  an  outgrowth  of  modernity  when 
you  stop  to  consider  the  cinema  head- 
liners  of  yesterday — Mary  Pickford, 
Marguerite  Clark,  Mary  Miles  M in- 
ter, Lillian  Gish,  May  Allison,  Cor- 
inne  Griffith.  May  McAvoy  and  doz- 
ens of  others.  These  girls  represent 
the  sort  of  woman  that  men  want  to 
protect. 

The  new  cinema  heroine  can  take 
care  of  herself,  thank  you,  since  she 
combines,  with  her  mysterious  allure, 
many  of  the  hard-headed  attributes 
and  even  some  of  the  physical  char- 
acteristics —  the  tall,  narrow-hipped, 
broad  shouldered  figure — of  men. 

You  may  tell  me  that  yesterday's 
screen  had  its  sirens.  Surely  it  did 
— women  like  Theda  Bara,  Xita 
Xaldi,  Gladys  Brockwell.  Betty 
Blythe,  who  led  a  man  to  destruction 
and  laughed — heh!  heh! — at  the 
plight  of  the  poor,  bewildered  thing. 
But  these  women  were  vampires, 
heartless  creatures,  villainesses.  and 
in  the  final  reel  the  fallen  hero  always 
returned  to  the  protecting  arms  of 
that  sweet,  golden-haired  girl  wait- 
ing for  him  in  a  halo  of  sunlight. 

NOWADAYS  it's  the  heroine  who 
falls.  These  new  vamps  are  not 
vamps  in  the  strictest  sense  of  the 
word,  since  they  are  the  heroines  of 
the  picture. 

The  bad  woman — the  shady  dame 
is  today's  heroine. 

There  is  no  point  of  contact  be- 
tween these  glamour  girls  and  their 
vampish  predecessors.  The  vamp 
was  all  feminine  allure.  Whereas  the 
children  of  mystery  have,  as  I 
pointed  out  a  paragraph  or  so  ago,  a  man's  viewpoint,  and  a 
man's  ability  to  deal  with  brutal  situations.  Hence — the  new 
sex.  And  because  she  is  new,  she  is  mysterious — this  shady 
dame. 

Look  over  the  standardized  cinema  star — those  thick, 
heavily  made-up  lips,  sloe  eyes,  lashes  heavy  with  mascara, 
hair  sweeping  in  a  hard  wave  from  high  forehead.  That's 
the  face.  The  body?  Slender  hips,  broad  shoulders,  lithe 
slim  lines.  And  now  for  the  voice — deep,  throaty,  guttural. 
You  know  that  voice. 

In  the  days  of  Marguerite  Clark  a  large  mouth  on  a  woman 
was  considered  ugly,  so  actresses  who  had  large  mouths 
rouged  their  lips  in  such  a  way  that  the  line  stopped  before  it 
reached  the  corner  of  the  mouth. 

But   did   you    notice   Joan    Crawford's   mouth   in    "Letty 

Lynton"?     The  lipstick  extended  beyond  the  corner  and  the 

mouth  was  greatly  exaggerated  in  both  thickness  and  length. 

And  her  eyes — Joan's  lovely,  large,  frank  eyes,  hidden  by 


DAMES"  of  the  Screen 


Frances  Dean,  a  lovely  newcomer,  already 
has  felt  the  Garbo  influence  in  make-up 
and  mannerisms.  Note  how  her  young 
mouth  has  been  thickened  and  lengthened 
with  lip  rouge  to  meet  the  new  demand 


weighted  lashes.  The  eyes  looked  black,  yet 
Joan's  eyes  are  blue.  The  effect,  so  somebody 
told  me,  was  attained  by  using  a  red  filament 
over  the  camera  lens  in  the  close-ups. 

The  strange  thing  is  that  Garbo  started  the 
fad  quite  unintentionally.  Garbo  is  naturally 
the  type  which  all  the  others  are  trying  to  be.  Her 
eyelashes  are  without  benefit  of  false  ones,  more 
than  an  inch  long.  They  curl  naturally.  Her  eye- 
lids droop  of  their  own  accord  and  her  hair  sweeps 
back  from  that  high  forehead  with  no  coiffeur  to 
guide  it.  Her  shoulders  are  naturally  broad,  her 
hips  slender  and  her  voice  low-pitched.  That 
long,  efficient,  almost  masculine  stride,  is  her  own. 

And  because  she  seemed  to  combine  subtly 
both  feminine  and  masculine  characteristics 
she  was  mysterious,  alluring  and  glamorous. 

PRODUCERS  are  not  to  be  blamed  for  their 
sheeplike  ways.  Garbo  brought  money  into 
their  coffers.  Sic — why  wouldn't  girls  who  copied 
Garbo's  looks,  her  mannerisms  and  her  clothes 
do  likewise?  The  hunt  for  Garbo  types  has  con- 
tinued since  box-office  receipts  from  her  first 
picture  told  the  executives  that  the  girl  was  a 
sensation. 

Paramount  discovered  Marlene  Dietrich,  who 
brought  her  own  brand  of  glamour  to  the  screen. 
More  lately,  Tallulah  Bankhead  arrived.  Now 
the  studio  is  experimenting  with  Sari    Maritza. 

Radio  Pictures  sought  for  a  long  time.  Gwili 
Andre,  a  Danish  girl  and  at  one  time  New  York's 
highest  paid  artist's  model,  was  the  end  of  their 
hunting  expedition.  The  powers  of  Radio  are 
breathlessly  awaiting  the  public's  acceptance  or 
rejection  of  Gwili.    She  looks  the  part.    Will  she 


Will  the  vogue  for  these 
so-called  glamorous  hero- 
ines of  Hollywood  last? 


live  up  to  expectations?  This  same  studio  has  high  hopes 
for  Jill  Esmond,  whom  you  saw  in  "State's  Attorney." 

Universal  presents  Tala  Birell.  She  didn't  have  much 
of  a  chance  in  "The  Doomed  Battalion"  but  she  has  been 
promised  an  opportunity  to  be  a  shady  dame  in  her  next 
picture. 

Fox  thought  Elissa  Landi  would  measure  up  to  specifica- 
tions, but  although  Elissa  has  a  strange  background  she 
has  the  characteristics  of  a  straight-forward,  intelligent 
Englishwoman,  with  a  peach  [  please  turn  to  page  90  1 


Norma  Shearer  has  passed  through  her  shady  dame 
period  and  gone  straight.  Although  she  runs  the 
gamut  of  emotions  in  "  Strange  Interlude,"  a  scene 
from  which  you  see  above,  "Smilin'  Through"— her 
next — marks  her  return  to  the  ultra  sweet  and  charming

Snow  and  Ice  in 
Hollywood?  Made 
with  Cornflakes! 


BURRR!  Looks  cold,  doesn't  it?  But  don't 
pull  up  your  coat  collars  yet, and  don't  envy 
the  stars  a  nice  location  trip  in  the  High  Sierras. 
Photographer  Stagg  found  this  amazing  scene 
right  on  one  of  the  stages  over  at  First  National 
Studios. 

The  snow  is  a  combination  of  fine  gypsum 


sand  and  thirty-five  tons  of  untoasted  corn- 
flakes. 

Honest!  That's  what  they  use  for  studio 
snow  in  Hollywood.  Enough  breakfasts  for 
a  regiment,  yet  it  is  much  less  expensive  to 
make  the  snow  than  it  is  to  take  a  company  to 
real  snow  country.

is  taking  a  lesson  in  screaming  from  Director 
William   Wellman. 

"Now  let  it  come  from  your  lungs,"  says 
Wellman, ' '  a  big  howl,  a  long  howl.   Let  it  out. " 


And  Barbara  answers:

SOMETHING  has  happened 
to  \nn  I  larding. 
Something  has  happened 
to  her  heart,  her  pride,  her 
soul. 

She  has  shut  herself  off  from 
friends.  A  recluse.  Like  a 
woman  hunted. 

Her  phone  has  been  discon- 
nected for  incoming  calls.  She 
can  call  out,  but  no  one  can  reach 
her. 

That  laugh  of  Ann's,  that 
cheery  companionship,  that  up- 
raised hand  in  gay  salute,  is  miss- 
ing. 

A  few  years  ago  Ann  Harding 
and  Harry  Bannister  came  to 
Hollywood  and  movies.  And 
frankly,  Hollywood  had  never 
seen  anything  quite  like  them. 
They  were  the  gayest,  happiest 
people  that  had  ever  landed  in 
these  parts. 

They  called  to  each  other  across 
the  lots.  "Hi  there,  boy,"  Ann 
would  call  to  Harry.  "Greetings, 
Ann,"  Harry  would  shout  across 
the  studio  dining-room.  On  the 
stages  they  would  meet  like  long- 
lost  lovers.  In  each  other's  arms. 
They  seemed  to  have  an  endless 
capacity  for  life  and  living  and 
fun. 

AND  there  was  something  so 
genuine,  so  real  about  it,  that 
Hollywood,  unaccustomed  as  it 
was,  swallowed  many  a  lump  in 
its  throat. 

There  was  an  air  of  assurance 
about  Ann  in  those  days.  She 
had  made  "Paris  Bound"  and 
"Holiday."  She  had  brought  us 
a  new  and  sparkling  type  of  act- 
ing and  we  loved  it. 

Yes,  Ann  was  sure  of  herself,  of 
Harry  and  her  happiness. 

They  made  few  friends,  these 
Bannisters.  But  they  did  like 
parties  at  Doug  and  Joan's  and 
had  grand  times.  But  you  see  and 
understand,  they  didn't  need 
many  friends.  They  were  so  com- 
pletely sufficient  to  each  other. 

Ann  kept  making  hit  after  hit. 
Going  on. 

But  Harry  did   not   seem  to  make  the  grade  with   equal 
speed. 

And  then,  bit  by  bit,  drop  by  drop,  the  deadly  poison  crept 
into  the  cup  of  Ann  and  Harry's  happiness. 

Ann  forgot,  or  didn't  realize,  the  most  vital  and  necessary 
things  in  the  entire  motion  picture  business. 

Ann  ignored  studio  politics.      And  made  the  most  fatal  of 
all  mistakes.      She  did  not  trust  enough 
t  i  the  intelligence  of  others.    She  wanted  jy         -* 

to  have  a  hand  in  story  and  direction,  JJ  V    J  GCLJl

Mar  ding 


What  Holly- 
wood has  done 
to  one  of  our 
loveliest  ladies 


as  well  as  the  difficult  work  of  acting.  It  can'!  be 
done.  Gloria  Swanson  tried  it.  And  lost  a 
fortune.  And  a  few  rungs  on  the  ladder  upward. 
And  right  there  Ann's  troubles  began.  She 
leaned  more  and  more  on  her  companion- 
secretary,  an  unusually  intelligent  young 
woman.  Unconsciously,  for  Ann  is  too  in- 
telligent to  be  consciously  swayed,  Ann  was 
swayed  this  way  and  that.  She  lost  her  per- 
spective. She  grew  impatient  with  her  directors 
and  her  stories.  She  had  made  one  weak 
picture.  It  happens  to  every  star.  Even  Garbo. 
The  applause  from  "Devotion"  and  echoes  from 
"Holiday"  rang  too  loudly  in  her  ears.  Instead 
of  shrugging  it  away,  she  allowed  it  to  affect  her. 

N  actress,  a  motion  picture  actress  at  least, 
must  be  but  a  bit  of  clay  in  the  hands  of  her 
director.     He  molds  and  shapes  the  character 
as  he  wants  it. 

Ann  Harding  landed  on  a  new  and  strange 
side  of  the  fence.  The  defensive  side.  From 
her  secure  and  sunny  side  of  life,  Ann  is  fighting 
in  the  shadows.    And  going  it  alone. 

Her  companion's  work  has  called  her  away. 
Harry — well,  you  know  about  Harry.  And 
perhaps  that's  the  bitterest  pill  Ann  has  to 
swallow.  For  Ann  is  absolutely  a  one-man 
woman.  To  her,  Harry  Bannister  was  the 
world  with  a  beautiful  white  fence  around  it. 
And  now  he  is  actually  getting  on  without  her. 
Living.  Developing  a  new  personality,  they 
say.  Oh,  of  course,  Ann  wants  him  to.  Else  all 
their  sacrifice  would  have  been  in  vain. 

But  still — pride  has  been  hurt. 
Her  man  seems  to  have  no  need  of 
her. 

Just  a  year  ago,  a  convention  of 
women's    clubs    was    held    in    Los 
Angeles.     Ann  Harding  was  the  in- 
vited   speaker.      She    stood    before 
them,   straight   and   slim,   confident 
and  sure  of  herself.     Her  blue  eyes 
flashing  the  message  of  that  keen, 
penetrating  mind. 
She  talked.    And  they  listened.    Entranced.    They  wouldn't 
let  her  go.    They  couldn't  get  enough  of  Ann  Harding.    That 
was  just  one  year  ago. 

A  few  weeks  ago  the  Junior  Leaguers  of  America  met  in 

Los  Angeles.    A  beautiful  luncheon  was  arranged  by  one  of  the 

studios.     Half-way  through,  a  slender  woman  stepped  quietly 

in  and  took  a  place  near  the  foot  of  the  table.     Her  hands 

trembled.    Her  eyes  lacked  the  old  light.

Hollywood,  California. 

GRETA  "LEGS" 
GARBO  bade  goodbye 
to  Hollywood  and 
American  motion 
pictures  today.    Or  did  she?

American  history  escorted

follows: 

Louis  B.  Mayer,  head  man 
of  the  studio  where  she  worked,  Grand  Marshal,  mounted  on 
Leo,  the  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  lion,  who  had  been  fitted  with 
new  false  teeth  for  the  occasion.

Here  I  Go"! 

"The  Garbo  Leading  Men's  Protective  Association"  weeping 
and  laughing,  with  Messrs.  Gilbert,  Asther,  Gable,  Mont- 
gomery, Ayres,  Nagel  and  the  Barrymore  Boys  in  line. 

Producers  with  unsigned  contracts,  and  actors  carrying 
lapsed  options  in  silver  tear  buckets. 

The  International  Herring-Picklers  Association  Band,  play- 
ing "Ain't  She  Swede?" 

An  empty  taxicab,  supposed  to  contain  the  body  of  the  star. 

Members  of  the  "  National  Sodality  of  Girls  Who  Think  They 
Look  Like  Garbo,"  with  60,000  slinking  blondes  in  line.  While 
this  division  was  passing  a  given  point,  the  spectators  went 
home  and  took  a  three-hour  nap.

While  the  procession  was  on 
the  march,  Garbo  was  reported 
flying  toward  San  Francisco 
disguised  as  a  tri-motored 
bomber  and  lurking  in  a  Santa 
Fe  engine-tender  made  up  as  a 
half-ton  of  soft  coal.

Columbus,  N.  M. — Greta  Garbo,  en  route  home,  bought  a 
Navajo  blanket  from  an  old  squaw  here  today.  "Sweden,

Bozeman,  Mont. — Greta  Garbo,  on  her  way  home  to

herself  in  the  middle  of  it.

Fluke  of  Macon,  Ga.,  the  kids  stayed  home  anyway,  and

Greta  Garbo,  retired  movie  star,  arrived  in  New  York  this 
morning  via  the  New  York  Central  and  Pennsylvania  Railroads 
and  the  Weehawken  Ferry.    Martial  law  was  at  once  declared. 

Excited  crowds  thronged  the  streets  as  the  news  spread. 
Dowdily  dressed  blondes  wearing  smoked  glasses  were  roughly 
handled  by  admiring  citizens. 

With  motor  cops  clearing  the  way,  the  Slithering  Scandi- 
hoovian  was  driven  to  the  Waldorf-Astoria,  Ritz  and  Ambas- 
sador Hotels,  and  to  the  home  of  Mr.  Edgar  Hopple,  Ail- 
American  pretzel-bender  in  '94,  at  Far  Rockaway,  L.  I. 

At  noon,  fifty-three  newspapermen  went  mad  and  bit  their 
city  editors.    All  were  treated  for  rabies. 


Toward  sundown,  Miss  Garbo  issued  a  touching  farewell  to 
the  American  people,  phoned  from  an  unlocated  pay-station. 
"Sounds  like  a  busy  signal,"  commented  Mr.  Eddie  "Banjo 
Eyes"  Cantor,  famous  comic  and  family  man. 

At  8  P.  M.  Miss  Garbo,  accompanied  by  the  Swedish  Consul, 
went  aboard  the  Steamships  Bremen,  Majestic,  Mauretania, 
Leviathan  and  the  Ferryboat  William  J.  Piddle,  III,  on  all  of 
which  the  royal  and  presidential  suites  had  been  reserved.  At 
nine,  with  shouts,  all  ships  cast  off  and  steamed  madly  into  the 
Atlantic.  Scores  of  passengers,  many  of  them  pie-eyed,  were 
left  teetering  on  the  piers. 

When  radioed  for  a  statement  from  the  ex-star,  all  wirelessed 
"Yawp"!  This  stirring  farewell  was  printed  in  full  in  late  extras. 

Keepers  of  filling  stations  noted  a  brisk  trade  in  beer  at  mid- 
night.   It  was  very  hot. 

Stockholm,  Sweden — Greta  Garbo,  local  actress,  has  pur- 
chased the  Kingdom  of  Sweden  for  fifty-two  American  dollars. 
She  promises  to  revolutionize  the  safety  match  industry  by 
making  them  out  of  petrified  pretzels,  and  is  investing  heavily 
in  a  new  Fjord  plant. 

Hollywood,  Calif. — "Garbo?  Greta  Garbo?"  said  Sergt. 
Hooley  of  the  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  studio  police  today. 
"Nobody  here  by  that  name,  mister.  Don't  mean  Joan  Craw- 
ford, do  ye?  "

several  dozen  people  behind  the  acting  lines  to  make  the  apache  number 
a  success  in  Paramount's  "Love  Me  Tonight."  Besides  the  general  set 
workers,  there  is  a  huge  orchestra,  only  part  of  which   is   shown    here

MAKE  way  for  the  new  screen  type! 
Get  ready  for  an  about-face  in 
screen  lovers! 
Take  a  long  last  look  at  Clark 
Gable  slapping  his  leading  lady's  face  and 
Jimmy  Cagney  giving  the  girl  friend  a  good 
sock  in  the  nose. 

The  new  actor  is  going  gentlemanly  with  a 
bang  (or  rather,  without  a  single  bang).  He'll 
combine  charm  with  his  ardor. 

And  Leslie  Howard  is  the  cause  of  it  all.  When,  a  little  over 
a  year  ago,  Leslie  Howard  said  to  the  movie  moguls,  "  I'm 
not  interested  in  your  long-term  contract:,  sirs,  since  they  mean 
I  must  take  any  part  that  I'm  tossed,"  five  young  actors  who 
would,  for  a  contract  gladly  play  the  off-stage  noise  for  a 
rhinoceros, swooned;  four  executives  were  rushed  to  the  hospital 
and  the  rest  of  Hollywood  talked  of  nothing  but  this  amaz- 
ing attitude  for  nine  days. 

But  this  local  furor  was  not  the  only  result  of  Leslie  Howard's 
sudden  leave-taking.  An  entirely  unexpected  thing  happened. 
When  he  uttered  those  now  famous  words  of  rebellion,  "I  can't 
stand  the  pace  of  picture  making,"  and  "I  refuse  to  be  caught 
up  in  the  machine,"  thousands  of  women  and  girls  throughout 
the  country  wrote  to  the  studios,  to  Photoplay  Magazine  and, 
for  all  I  know,  to  the  President  of  the  United  States,  begging 
that  all  forces  be  combined  in  an  effort  to  bring  Leslie  back. 

The  picture  executives  were,  to  put  it  mildly,  flabbergasted, 
for  none  of  them  had  spotted  Leslie  as  the  type  to  promote 
palpitations  of  the  feminine  heart.  The  vigorous  face-slapping 
Gables,  Cagneys,  George  Brents  etal.  were  the  accepted  type. 
These  young  bloods  were  riding  the  crest  of  the  cinema  wave. 
Howard  was  their  direct  antithesis — a  gentleman  both  on  and 
off  screen  (a  British  gentleman,  at  that)  and  a  stage  actor  more 
subtle  than  spectacular. 

THE  executives  figured  him  as  one  of  those  good,  capable 
leading  men  but  not,  by  any  manner  of  means,  sensational. 
He  was  okay — this  Howard — but  women  wouldn't  lose  any 
beauty  sleep  over  him. 

And  then — the  miracle!  With  only  a  few  films  to  his  credit — 
the  highbrow  "Outward  Bound,"  Norma  Shearer's  "A  Free 
Soul,"  Marion  Davies'  "Five  and  Ten,"  Ann  Harding's  "De- 
votion," and  "Never  the  Twain  Shall  Meet" — he  became  a 
rage.  And  in  all  the  pictures  he  played  the  role  of  a  sensitive 
soul  with  nary  a  sock  for  a  lady  in  a  hundred  reels. 

The  movie  pundits  shook  their  heads  and  looked  bewildered. 
And  immediately  began  to  besiege  him  with  offers.    But  Leslie, 


Leslie  Howard's 
return  to  Holly- 
wood gives  the 
gentleman  lover 
break  at  last 


having  declared  himself,  worked  away  in 
England  in  a  film  called  "Reserved  for 
Ladies"  and  then  returned  to  the  New  York 
stage  in  "The  Animal  Kingdom." 

And  even  though  he  was  off  the  screen  for 
several  long  months,  he  was  not  forgotten. 
Each  mail  brought  more  and  more  letters 
begging  for  his  return.  And  each  day  some 
movie  company  had  a  shiny  new  offer  ready 
for  him. 
But  now  that  he  held  the  whip  he  realized  he  could  dictate 
his  own  terms. 

And  these  are  the  terms.  He  will  make  one  picture  for 
M-G-M  and  that  will  be  "Smilin'  Through,"  with  Norma 
Shearer.  Incidentally,  he  will  play  the  old  man — young  in  the 
earlier  sequences — but  old  throughout  most  of  the  picture. 
Fredric  March  will  be  borrowed  from  Paramount  to  play  the 
other  male  lead,  the  younger  man.  Leslie  then  goes  to  Radio 
Pictures  to  do  "The  Animal  Kingdom."  And  that's  all.  But 
there's  a  clever  clause  in  the  contract.  If  he  likes  Hollywood 
and  if  everything  goes  smoothly  and  nobody  asks  him  to  play 
a  role  that  does  not  suit  him,  he'll  knock  off  another  picture  for 
the  folks.    Otherwise,  he'll  return  to  the  stage. 


SO  cheer  up,  you  languishing  ladies. 
c 


Gentleman  Howard  is 

^coming  back. 

To  me,  the  craze  for  Leslie  is  rather  a  proof  that  movie-goers 
are  not  so  moronic  as  some  of  the  lads  would  have  you  believe. 
For  here  is  an  intelligent  actor  of  just  a  little  different  stamp 
from  the  average  run — and  they  love  him. 

He  lives  a  sane  sort  of  life  with  his  wife,  also  British,  and  his 
two  children — a  daughter,  Leslie,  and  a  son,  Ronald,  who  is  now 
at  school  in  England.  He  putters  around  with  a  camera,  at 
which  hobby  he  is  exceptionally  able;  he  draws  a  bit;  plays  the 
piano  by  ear;  likes  tennis  and  swimming  and  has  a  nice  apprecia- 
tion of  all  the  arts. 

As  far  as  colorful  background  is  concerned  the  Gables,  Brents 
and  Cagneys  have  him  beat.  But  Leslie  Howard  has  something 
more  than  that. 

It  was  a  subtle  thing  that  fans  saw  in  Leslie  Howard  and  it 
was  not  merely  that  he  was  a  good  actor,  for  many  good  actors 
have  failed  in  Hollywood.  Entirely  lacking  in  the  obvious  sex 
appeal  that  seems  to  be  in  such  demand  at  the  moment,  he 
possesses  a  rare,  faun-like  quality  and  a  whimsical  humor  that 
seems  to  get  through  to  the  camera  as  it  gets  over  the  footlights. 

Anent  his  long  hold-out  he  said,  "I've  no  quarrel  with  the 
motion  picture  producers.    They      [  please  turn  to  page  95  ]

GARBO  stays! 
As  we  bustle  to  press,  the  betting  odds 
are  sixteen  to  three  that  the  Stockholm 
Siren  settles  right  back  in  the  traces  and  ambles 
mysteriously  through  more  Hollywood  talkies. 

She  may  not  even  take  that  holiday  junket 
to  the  old  Swedish  home.  If  she  does,  she'll 
probably  sign  on  the  dotted  line  before  she 
goes.  For  Garbo's  an  alien,  and  might  have  a 
tough  time  getting  back  where  the  big  money 
grows. 

She's  not  on  the  Swedish  quota,  and  is  just 
another  blonde  immigrant  to  hard-hearted 
old  Uncle  Sam. 

Further,  wiseacres  bet  she'll  stay  on  the  old 
Metro  lot,  where  she  got  rich  and  famous.  She 
wants  stories  that  please  her  and  directors  that 
understand  her. 


And  she  can  collect  about  $15,000  a  week 
— rain,  shine  or  earthquake. 

Now,  Greta,  don't  go  and  cross  us  up  by 
going  before  this  issue  drops  before  the 
hungry  readers!

cial skullduggery. 

But  Harry  Eddington,  her  manager,  who 
should  know,  says  most  of  the  Garbo 
doubloons  are  safe  in  government  bonds.

TF  word  comes  from  Paris  that  Ruth  Chatter-

supposed  to  have  bragged  that  she's  two  up  on

she  has  two  babies.

hopped  in  himself,  and  chugged  out  of  Holly- 
wood headed  East. 

He  also  said  he  was  going  to  make  some 
European  personal  appearances. 

Warner  Brothers  made  no  move  to  hoist 
Cagney's  wages  above  the  $1,400  a  week  mark 
— hence  his  bow  out. 

I  hope  it  isn't  so. 

Cagney  turned  in  more  crafty  performances 
in  some  smart  pictures  during  his  brief  Holly-

picture  history.

Africa  and  it  was  because  of  her — or  him — that  Gary  had  to  take  a 
big  Beverly  Hills  home.  Apartment  house  managers  liked  Gary 
but  didn't  want  Toluca.  Some  folks  will  tell  you  that  Gary  has 
gone  grand — with  butlers,  derby  hats  and  fancy  walking  sticks.

out.  And  when  he  steps  forth  alone  the  gossips 
rear  their  ugly  heads.  Where's  Carole?  Ah-ha! 
Scrapping!  But  really  it's  just  the  above — we 
hope  and  trust. 

'PWO  of  the  biggest  stars  on 
A  "Grand  Hotel"  didn't  speak 
after  the  first  few  days  of  the  picture. 

Reason?  the  male  star  told  the  lady- 
one  to  go  home  and  learn  how  to  act. 

Three  guesses. 

T_JOLLYWOOD  and  Beverly  Hills  still  have 
the  leaping  jitters  from  that  bank  closing. 

It  froze  a  lot  of  actors'  assets,  as  well  as  their 
big  warm  hearts.  It  finally  caused  Jean  Her- 
sholt  to  try  to  forget  that  he  was  once  a  bank 
director — something  that  gave  him  pride  in  the 
days  when  dollars  grew  on  dewberry  bushes. 

Wally  Beery,  they  say,  kissed  $48,000  good- 
bye this  time — right  on  top  of  $80,000  that 
went  bye-bye  in  two  other  closings.  His  pet 
airplane  now  rests  in  the  stall  because  he 
can't  afford  oats. 

Douglass  Montgomery  hopes  that  his  forty 
grand  trust  fund  is  safe.  But  he  has  an  $8,000 
checking  account  that  frets  him. 

The  story  has  been  that  Garbo's  intention 
to  withdraw  $300,000  to  buy  ash-trays  for  her 
Swedish  friends  slapped  the  plaster  on  the 
bank  door.  But  my  straight  dope  is  that  a 
cement  company's  threat  of  a  big  withdrawal 
really  did  the  dirty  work. 


The  Gleasons — ma,  pop  and  sonny-boy — 
also  went  heavily,  on  top  of  losses  in  another 
failure.  But  you  can't  down  that  tribe. 
"I  feel  we  will  get  it  back,"  says  Russell, 
grinning.  "And  if  we  don't  we'll  earn  some 
more."   And  they  will. 

The  saddest  touch  is  that  the  Renee  Adoree 
Fund,  chipped  in  by  pals  to  help  the  little 
darling  recover  from  her  three-year  illness, 
went  over  the  dam!  Let's  hope  they  all  get  it 
back! 

"""THAT  roar  you  hear  in  the  West  isn't  a  war. 
It's  the  highest-powered  actor  temperament 
in  America  exploding  all  over  Hollywood. 

For  the  Royal  Family  is  all  there — the  three 
senior  Barrymores  are  fizzing  and  sputtering  on 
the  Metro  lot.  Some  dad-burned  and  gosh- 
hanged  fun.  Sister  Ethel  has  joined  Brothers 
Jack  and  Lionel  to  make  a  talkie  for  M-G-M. 
Big  family  reunions,  and  all  that.  Then  the 
shooting  is  on. 

"Is  Miss  Ethel  nervous  about  the  movies?" 
a  reporter  asked  Brother  Jack. 

"Nervous?"  replied  Little  Buvver.  "That 
one?  Oh  I  guess  not?  She'll  just  be  standing  in 
front  of  Lionel  and  me  in  every  scene!" 

"And  I  suppose  you're  happy  about  the 
family  reunion?  "  pursued  the  news  hound. 

"Oh  sure,"  said  Johnny,  "but  I  sure  feel 
sorry  for  the  poor  guy  that's  got  to  direct  that 
reunion!"     What  a  business!

YOU  see,  the  trouble  was, 
Hollywood  was  so  busy 
watching  the  didoes  of 
Clara  Bow  and  the  acro- 
batic antics  of  Lupe,  they  forgot 
to  pay  much  attention  to  the 
little  girl  from  Tennessee  who 
slipped  quietly  into  town  with 
practically  no  sounding  of  cym- 
bals or  tooting  of  horns. 

Oh,  of  course,  they  paused  long 
enough  for  a  long,  speculative 
look  that  took  in  at  a  glance  the 
plain  brown  hair,  the  timid,  blue 
eyes,  the  flowered  dimity  dress 
with  the  blue.sash  (I  tell  you  she 
wore  it,  flowered  dimity  with  a 
blue  sash;  ask  anyone!).     And. 
feeling  that  hubby  was  safe  for 
wife  and  democracy,  that  no  bov 
friend     would     go    wandering 
after  flowered  dimity  and  no 
choice  movie  roles  were  in  any 
immediate  danger,  they  went 
back  to  their  ringside  seats 
to  watch  Clara  and  Lupe  with 
hearts  free  from  worry,  as 
far  as  Dorothy  Jordan  was 
concerned. 

And  thereby  made  one 
of  the  greatest  errors  that's 
been  made  since  everyone 
thought  Vicki  Baum  was 
something  to  rub  on  the 
chest. 

For  Hollywood  didn't 
know,  and  is  only  now 
getting  a  faint  glimmer- 
ing  of   the   truth,    that 
here,  in  a  blue  sash,  is 
the  kind  of  little  gal  to 
fix  with  the  glassy  eye. 
That  it's  the  dainty  little 
girl  with  the  timid,  help- 
less ways  that  appeals  to 
everything     that's     pro- 
tective and  fatal  to  hearts 
of  brave  mankind.     The 
greatest  sirens  of  them  all. 

It  isn't  the  sexy  mama 
with  the  artificial  brassiere 
and  spit  curls  that  wreaks 
the  greatest  havoc.    That's 
only  in  the  movies. 

It  isn't  the  wiggling  mama 
with    the   yard-long   earrings 
and     tight     across-the-back- 
gowns  that  reaps  the,  oh  so 
golden,  harvest.     Not  always 

For   look.      Lupe   left    town 
without   annexing  anyone's  boy 
friend  in  particular.    She  even  con- 
tributed to  the  eligibility  of  male 
Hollywood  and  put  Gary  back  into 
circulation.    And  Clara  just  wanted 
her  Rex.    And  got  him. 

But  what  Dorothy  Jordan  has  done 
to  Hollywood  will  go  down  in  history. 

She  has  stepped  in  and  without  even 
trying  (heaven  help  us  if  Dot  puts  forth  any 
effort)  has  walked  off  with  Hollywood's  prize 
catches  of  the  year.    And  is  even  slightly  annoyed

by  them.  And  doesn't  know 
what  to  do  with  them.  And 
can't  for  the  life  of  her  imagine 
how  they  got  there. 

But  people  are  out  to  do 
things  for  that  little  Jordan  girl 
from  down  Tennessee  way.  They 
trip  and  fall  all  over  themselves 
to  do  things  that  have  never 
been  done  before  in  the  history 
of  the  movies. 

What,  for  instance,  does  a 
star  usually  do  when  his  leading 
lady  swipes  scenes  from  under 
his  nose?  No,  don't  say  it.  We 
can't  bear  it. 

So  what,  do  you  think,  did 
Richard  Barthelmess  do  for  Dot 
Jordan,  his  leading  lady  in  "The 
Cabin  in  the  Cotton"? 
Oh,  he  just  gave  her  a  dinner, 
an  elaborate  and  ten-course 
dinner    for    little    Dot    that 
would  curl  the  hair  of  Mrs. 
Van  Astor's  poodle. 
And  wait.    Who  took  Dor- 
othy home?   Insisted  on  it. 
Would  have  strangled  any- 
one that  interfered.  And  all 
the  way  down  to  Palisades 
del  Rey  where  Dorothy 
lives  with  her  mama.  Who? 
Well,  and  hold  tight,  little 
honey  blondes  of  Holly- 
wood, it  was  just  Mrs. 
Colman's  handsome  boy, 
Ronald.    Just  little  try- 
to  -  get  -  within  -  twenty  - 
miles-of-me-Colman, 
that's  all.    And  loved  it. 

AND  just  where  was 
that  prize  catch  of 
Hollywood,  that  million- 
aire boy  producer  who 
could   have  the  pick  of 
Hollywood  beauties, 
when   nobody   could   lo- 
cate the  lad  of  an  evening? 
Oh,  he  was  just  a  sit- 
ting down  in  Uttle  Dorothy 
"Jawdan's"  sitting  room. 
Sitting  and  sitting  and  sit- 
ting.   While  upstairs  Doro- 
thy could  be  heard  pacing 
back   and   forth,   back   and 
forth,  reading  her  Unes  for 
her  next  picture. 
And  Mr.  Hughes  just  waited 
and  waited  and  waited.     And 
loved  it.    The  only  waiting  he's 
had  to  do  for  any  young  lady  for 
a  long,  long  time.     And  all  the 
time  Hollywood

HOLLYWOOD  thought  this  beautiful  girl  had  a  colorless  person- 
ality. But  Hollywood  may  occasionally  be  dead  wrong,  as  the 
intimate  story  about  Irene  Dunne  over  on  the  opposite  page  proves. 
Here's  the  smile  she  flashes  on  her  co-workers  and  they  are  all  for  her, 
to  a  man.    It's  a  neat  trick  if  you  can  do  it.    And  Irene  tells  you  how

Irene  Dunne  was  burned  up  when 
Photoplay   said    that    about    her 


A 


WOMAN  must  use  her  personality  to  be  successful," 
and  we'll  give  you  up  to  eighty-three  guesses  who 
said  that.  No,  not  Lupe  Velez,  or  Clara  Bow,  or 
"Tallulah  Bankhead.  Sweet,  charming,  gentle  Irene 
Dunne  voiced  that  statement  and  further  admitted  that  much 
of  her  success  from  childhood  on  has  come  from  the  judicious 
use  of  the  subtle  art  of  flirtation. 

Most  of  the  folks  in  Hollywood  dismiss  Irene  with  a  shrug  and 
such  comments  as  "a  girl  of  quiet  charm."  "A  lady."  "Nothing 
exciting  about  her."  The  newspaper  writers  call  her  "poor 
copy." 

Recently  there  appeared  in  Photoplay  a  picture  of  Irene 
under  which  was  written:  "There's  little  to  write  about  Irene 
Dunne  except  that  she's  a  grand  actress,  that  she  can  sing,  is  a 
swell  golf  player  and  a  nice  person." 

And  was  Irene  burned  up  about  it!  She  sizzled  and  fumed 
for  a  couple  of  days.    "Just  a  nice  person"  indeed! 

And  when  we  stop  to  think  about  it,  maybe  we  were  wrong. 
Not,  of  course,  that  Irene  isn't  a  nice  person — she  is  that — 
but  she  isn't  "just  a  nice  person"  if  you  get  that  subtle  but  very 
pertinent  distinction. 

There's  an  amazing  story  about  Irene  which  ties  up  with  her 
remark  there  in  the  first  paragraph.  And  there  are  lots  of  girls 
who  can  apply  to  their  own  lives  some  of  her  philosophy. 

So  let's  go  back  a  little  and  have  a  good  look  at  this  Dunne 
girl.  How  did  she,  a  musical  comedy  singer,  manage  to  secure 
the  difficult  and  dramatic  lead  in  the  epic  picture,  "Cimarron"? 
Why  wasn't  she  sent  back  to  New  York  along  with  the  other 
warblers,  when  musicals  went  out  of  fashion  in  Hollywood? 
Why  was  director  Wesley  Ruggles  so  sure  that  she  was  the 
right  actress  for  the  part? 

Why  did  even  the  electricians  and  the  prop  boys  pull  for  this 
newcomer?  For,  at  that  time,  no  one  knew  whether  she  could 
act  or  not.  As  yet  she  was  an  untested  Sabra  when  hundreds  of 
actresses  would  have  given  their  six  best  evening  gowns,  and 
a  couple  of  sets  of  French  lingerie  thrown  in,  for  the  role  of 
Sabra  Cravat  in  "Cimarron."  And  as  a  rule,  Hollywood  is 
none  too  kind  to  the  stage  newcomer  when  studio  girls  are 
languishing  for  jobs. 

But  here's  what  happened. 

Ernest  Westmore,  make-up  man  de 
luxe,  begged  her  to  allow  him  to  give 
her  a  perfect  make-up  for  the  part, 
several  weeks  before  she  was  assigned 
the  role.  He  insisted  that  she  have 
pictures  taken  as  Sabra.  Ern  took 
those  pictures  to  producer  Bill  Le- 
Baron.  Ern  claimed  Irene  Dunne  as 
his  discovery.  And  LeBaron  claims 
her  as  his.  And  the  man  who  took 
the  original  pictures  puts  in  his  claim, 
too. 


IRENE  let  them  all  take  the  credit 
and  she  accepted  the  part  with  the 
grace  of  a  queen  bestowing  a  favor. 

Poor  copy  for  newspaper  writers? 
Of  course,  she's  poor  copy.  A  woman 
as  subtle  and  as  clever  as  that  doesn't 
tip  her  hand  while  she  still  has  aces 
to  play. 

Every  man  on  the  Radio  Pictures 
lot  would  take  a  flying  jump  off  the 
highest  Beverly  hill  tomorrow  if  Irene 
asked  him  to.  The  cameraman,  the 
electricians,  the  prop  boys — all  adore 
her.    Whv?  Because  she  knows  how  to

use  her  personality.  Because  she  gets  what  she  wants  by  using 
her  charm,  her  sense  of  humor — and  her  beautiful,  sympathetic 
eyes. 

During  her  apprenticeship  in  the  studio,  she  was  so  nice 
and  courteous  to  everybody  on  the  lot — from  producer  to 
prop  boy — that  by  the  time  a  big  chance  like  "Cimarron" 
came  they  were  all  rooting  for  her  and  anxious  to  see  her  get 
the  opportunity. 

And  what  those  little  friendships  mean!  If  a  cameraman 
dislikes  a  star,  he  can  ruin  her  photographically.  The  elec- 
trician can  "burn  her  up"  with  lights.  The  assistant  director 
can  make  it  most  unpleasant  for  her. 

But  nobody  disliked  Irene.  In  fact,  they  were  all  crazy 
about  her. 

When  Irene  finished  her  role  in  Fannie  Hurst's  "Back 
Street,"  at  Universal,  she  had  more  friends  for  the  space  of 
time  she  remained  there  than  any  other  girl  has  ever  had. 
And  the  boys  on  the  set  voted  her  the  swellest  girl  they  knew. 

WHAT'S  more,  they  did  a  lot  of  little  things  that  would 
spare  her  trouble — such  as  making  telephone  calls  for  her, 
and  things  like  that.  Director  John  Stahl  even  barred  the  set  to 
protect  her  from  prying  eyes — something  that  is  rarely  done 
for  one  so  new  in  the  game  as  Irene. 

Irene  did  all  this  by  using  her  personality  and  her  charm. 
And  here's  where  your  little  lesson  comes  in,  for  the  picture 
business  is  not  much  different  from  any  other  business. 
With  fundamental  ability,  even  latent  ability,  it  is  the  woman 
who  knows  how  to  use  her  charm  who  gets  the  breaks.  She 
doesn't  necessarily  have  to  be  a  flirt — but  she  must  know  the 
gentle  art  of  making  a  man  feel  important. 

For  instance,  when  Irene  walks  on  the  set,  she  says  to  the 
cameraman,  "You're  looking  great  today.  What  a  good  looking 
tie  you  have  on."  And  to  the  prop  boy,  "Been  to  the  beach? 
That  coat  of  tan  is  most  becoming."  But  she  never  does  it 
obviously — oh  my,  no.  And  the  funny  part  is  that  she 
genuinely  likes  these  people.  You  must  like  people,  else  in- 
sincerity will  get  through  to  them  in  some  mysterious  fashion. 
Irene  has  been  successful  all  her 
life.  When  she  was  in  line  for  a 
scholarship  in  a  Chicago  musical  col- 
lege, she  was  particularly  nice  to  one  of 
the  judges.  Her  voice  was  excellent — 
for  without  that  she  couldn't  have 
won — but  it  was  that  judge  who 
fought  for  her  championship  as  no 
other  professor  fought  for  the  other 
contenders. 

And  she's  been  exercising  her  gentle 
feminine  tricks  ever  since. 


YET  she  said,  "It's  not  a  good  thing 
to  flirt  with  your  leading  man.  It's 
too  dangerous.  He  might  misunder- 
stand. You  have  to  keep  your  mind 
on  your  work.  You  have  to  make 
love,  anyhow,  and  if  you  flirt  and 
become  serious  .  .  .  not  so  good." 

"A  woman  must  avoid  that,"  Irene 
admitted.  "Perhaps  flirting  is  fun, 
but  falling  in  love  is  fatal.  Flirta- 
tions are  from  the  head;  love  is  from 
the  heart. 

"Using  one's  personality  is  the  femi- 
nine form  of  back  slapping.  Used 
subtly  it  is  effective;  used  cheaply  it 
is  disgusting."

"My  mother  is  charming  to  everyone.  She  never  orders 
groceries  or  meats  over  the  phone.  Instead,  she  goes  to  the 
butcher  personally.  She  calls  him  by  his  first  name  in  no  time 
and  she  always  gets  the  best  cuts  of  meat  at  the  best  prices."' 

Naturally,  Irene's  real  dramatic  talent  made  her  a  success — 
but  many  a  genius  has  hid  his  light  under  a  bushel  for  want  of  a 
little  graciousness.  Irene  does  not  go  around  hiding  her  light 
under  any  stray  bushels. 

I  REMEMBER  the  first  time  I  saw  Irene  Dunne.  It  was 
while  she  was  making  "Cimarron"  and  it  was  one  of  the 
hottest,  dustiest  days  California  has  ever  known.  She  was  on 
location  in  that  miniature  city  that  was  built  for  the  picture. 
Cameramen  were  fuming;  assistant  directors  rushing  madly 
about  on  what  seemed,  to  the  inexperienced  eye,  utterly 
futile  errands;  great  crowds  of  extras  were  milling  around  in 
the  space  allotted  to  them — in  fact,  everybody  on  that  set,  in- 
cluding the  horses,  was  in  a  state  of  turmoil.  Did  I  say  every- 
body?   I  take  that  back. 

Seated  in  a  hastily  built  little  dressing-room  was  Irene 
Dunne — as  cool  and  as  calm  as  the  first  peach  blossom  of 
spring.  Her  make-up  showed  not  the  slightest  trace  of  wear 
and  tear  from  the  heat  and  the  strain.  She  was  sipping  an 
iced  drink — which  some  prop  boy  had  miraculously  brought 
from  somewhere — and  regarding  the  turgid  scene. 

You  would  have  thought  that  a  newcomer,  as  Irene  was  then, 
might  have  been  flustered  and  excited  at  finding  herself  in  the 
midst  of  all  this.  Perhaps  you  would  have  imagined  that  an 
actress,  untried  in  the  picture  business,  would  have  been  in 
the  thick  of  it  all,  asking  questions  and  otherwise  making  her- 
self a  nuisance. 

But  not  Irene.  Instead  she  offered  me  a  chair,  as  if  she  had 
been  in  her  own  beautifully  appointed  drawing  room,  and  said, 
"What  a  shame  that  you  had  to  come  out  on  such  a  hot  day." 
And,  calling  to  a  prop  boy,  "Do  you  think  you  could  find  an- 
other glass  of  cold  lemonade?" 

We  chatted  about  the  role  that  she  had  succeeded  in  getting 
in  the  manner  I've  already  explained. 


"I  had  no  doubts  about  getting  the  part,"  she  said,  "I  only 
hope,  now  that  I've  got  it,  that  I'm  able  to  do  it  well  enough 
and  yet  I  feel  that  I  know  this  Sabra  Cravat.  I've  almost 
memorized  the  book — I  did  that  before  I  was  sure  that  my 
tests  were  right.  I  thought  that  if  I  knew  Sabra  well  enough  I 
would  surely  be  allowed  to  make  her  come  alive  on  the  screen. 

"You  see  when  I  realized  that  musical  pictures,  for  which  I 
was  given  a  contract,  were  out  of  fashion  and  that  perhaps 
I'd  have  to  wait  a  long,  long  time  for  them  to  come  in  style 
again,  I  knew  that  I'd  simply  have  to  be  an  actress — that  I'd 
have  to  work  with  a  medium  other  than  my  voice,  so  I  set 
about  the  task  of  learning  to  be  an  actress.  And  when  I 
knew  that  someone  would  play  the  role  of  Sabra  in  'Cimarron' 
I  wanted  that  someone  to  be  me  more  than  anything  else  in 
the  world.'' 

But  what  she  didn't  tell  me  and  what  I  didn't  know  at  that 
time  was  how  she  set  about  getting  that  role — how  she  exer- 
cised her  charm  and  her  graciousness  upon  everyone  who 
could  help  her  to  have  the  thing  she  wanted.  It  was  most 
certainly  done  in  a  worthy  cause  for  those  who  saw  "Cimar- 
ron" agree  that  no  actress  in  Hollywood  could  have  played  the 
role  of  Sabra  with  greater  understanding  and  finesse.  In 
every  picture  in  which  she  has  since  been  cast,  she  has  given  a 
good  capable  performance.  Lots  of  folks  will  take  you  aside 
and  whisper  confidentially  that  Irene  has  done  her  best  movie 
job  to  date  in  "Back  Street." 

IRENE  has  climbed  the  slippery  ladder  of  film  fame  with 
surefooted  determination.  She  has  not  wavered  once. 
And  this  is  the  person  whom  Hollywood  has  called  colorless. 
But  Hollywood  simply  slipped  her  in  the  wrong  file.  Irene 
is  about  as  colorless  as  a  rainbow.  If  you'd  see  her  flash  those 
eyes  you'd  never  say  again  that  she  was  colorless.  And — 
what's  more — she  holds  her  husband  who  adores  her,  while  he 
is  in  New  York  practicing  medicine  and  she  is  in  Hollywood 
being  an  actress.  Irene  is  far  from  colorless.  She's  a  brilliant, 
charming,  witty  young  woman.  Come  on,  Irene,  forgive  us  for 
calling  you  "just  a  nice  person."

as  radio  announcers  say,  if 
you  don't  see  an  electric  sign  over 
your  local  theater  reading  Barbara 
Lyon  in  "Inheritance,"  about  the  year 
1952,  you'll  know  this  inheritance 
theory  is  a  lot  of  scientific  bologna. 
Barbara  Bebe  Lyon,  aged  nine  months, 
can't  ever  say  she  wasn't  given  a 
chance,  for  she's  being  brought  up 
with  a  camera.  Papa  Ben  Lyon,  no 
slouch  as  a  photographer,  started  tak- 
ing pictures  of  her  when  she  was  a 
week  old.  Ben  took  the  photographs 
you  see  here  and  on  the  strength  of  his 
ability  has  been  retained  as  one  of 
Photoplay's  regular  staff.  We  aren't 
sure,  but  maybe  next  month  we'll 
show  you  a  couple  of  pages  of  his 
intimate  shots  of  film  folk.  Because 
he  plays  cameraman,  Ben  doesn't  get 
a  break  here — it  all  goes  to  Bebe  and 
the  baby.  Bebe  is  a  good  actress,  as  we 
all  know,  but  a  terrible  photographer. 
If  the  pictures  she  takes  aren't  out  of 
focus,  she  cuts  her  subjects'  heads  off

STARS  no  longer  choose  their 
gowns  simply  because  the  shade 
is  becoming.     They  select  colors 
to  which  they  radiate  happily. 

Furthermore,  the  studios  are  now 
more  and  more  careful  about  dressing 
both  the  women  and  the  men  in  colors 
which  encourage  mental  satisfaction. 
The  designers  and  executives  will  or- 
der a  blue  gown  which  does  not  pho- 
tograph so  well  as  a  brown  one,  if  the 
blue  is  the  choice  of  the  star. 

They  know,  for  instance,  that  Joan 
Crawford  will  give  a  better  interpre- 
tation of  a  part,  everything  else  be- 
ing equal,  if  she  is  gowned  in  blue.     And  even  though  orchid 
might  be  more  advantageous  from  a  shadow  and  light  (pho- 
tographic) standpoint,  they  would  not  consider  asking  Joan  to 
act  a  single  scene  in  orchid.     She  hates  it. 

This  is  true  even  of  Technicolor  pictures,  where  naturally 
colors   are   startlingly  important  from  a  photographic  angle. 

When  Fay  Wray  was  selecting  her  ward- 
robe for  "  Doctor  X, "  an  all-Technicolor  pro- 
duction, Natalie  Kalmus,  the  color  scientist 
for  the  Technicolor  Company,  suggested  a 
robe  of  turquoise  blue  which  was  scientifical- 
ly the  best  color.  Fay  looked  ravishing — 
both  to  the  naked  eye  and  to  the  more  deli- 
cate one  of  the  color  camera. 

But  Fay  didn't  like  it.  She  felt  uncom- 
fortable. She  did  not  vibrate  to  it.  She 
chose,  instead,  a  dark  blue  robe.  She  couldn't 
explain  her  reactions.  She  said,  "I  just/ee/ 
better  in  it. " 

Natalie  Kalmus  knew  the  robe  would  go 
green  for  the  picture.  She  didn't  tell  Fay. 
Although  turquoise  blue  would  be  better  for 
the  shot,  green  would  not  actually  damage 
the  color  scheme.  But  if  Fay  didn't  feci 
right,  her  acting  might  not  be  right.  Mrs. 
Kalmus  knew  no  actress  could  do  her  best 
work  with  wrong  radiations  emanating  from 
the  color  she  was  wearing. 

This  may  sound  silly  to  you.  I  can  assure 
you  that  there  is  no  star  in  Hollywood  who 
considers  it  so,  today.

reactions  to  various  colors 


By    Lois    Skirl ey 


Natalie  Kalmus,  color 
scientist  for  the  Technicolor 
Company,  who  tells  the 
stars  why  their  color  prefer- 
ences influence  their  lives 


should  have  been  well  with  the  world 
and  wondered  why  you  felt  dis- 
gruntled, unhappy,  restless?  You 
could  find  no  reason  for  feeling 
wrong  when  your  common  sense  told 
you  you  should  feel  right? 

The  next  time,  look  down  at  the 
suit  or  the  dress  you  are  wearing.  The 
color  may  make  you  appear  stunning 
but  it  may  also  be  the  sole  cause  of 
your  rebellion. 

Sylvia  Sidney,  for  example,  with 

her  dark,  Russian  beauty  can  select 

no  color  more  appropriate  for  her 

than  red.    Yet,  she  does  not  wear  it. 

She  knows  it  means  mental  restlessness! 

The  women  of  the  screen  turn  to  Natalie  Kalmus  to  help 
them  diagnose  their  color  vibrations. 

Mrs.  Kalmus  told  me  what  she  has  told  them  all:    "Color  is 
a  smile  or  a  frown.     You  know  how  you  feel  on  a  dark,  dank 
day.     Grays;  purples  (the  purple  haze);  somber  colors  about 
you.    That  is  the  frown. 

"And  on  bright  days?  The  clear  blue  of 
the  sky;  the  fresh  green  of  the  foliage;  the 
Hashing  yellow  of  the  sun.  That  is  the  smile. 
"And  men  and  women  help  themselves  to 
frown  or  to  smile  by  the  radiations  they  en- 
courage or  discourage  in  the  colors  they  select 
not  only  for  their  wearing  apparel  but  for 
their  houses — their  surroundings!" 


YOU  will  find  a  simplified  color  chart,  made 
by  Natalie  Kalmus,  on  these  pages  to 
»\hich  you  can  refer  in  choosing  your  colors. 
And,  after  I  have  told  you  how  the  stars  react, 
you  can  play  a  fascinating  game  by  analyz- 
ing the  color  likes  and  dislikes  of  yourself  and 
your  friends.  Why  do  certain  colors  buoy 
you  up  and  others  take  you  down?  Read  on

When  Gloria  Swanson  was  at  the  height 
of  her  career  she  had  a  violent  antipathy  for 
"old  rose"  and  would  not  permit  anyone 
wearing  it  to  come  near  her.  Once,  while 
she  was  making  a  scene  in  which  she  had  to 
appear  very  annoyed,  the  director  discov- 
ered that  he  could  not  work  her  up  to  the 
proper  anger  pitch.    Her  wardrobe  designer

had  an  idea  and,  with  the  director's  consent,  picked  out  one  of 
the  extra  girls  and  had  her  dressed  in  old  rose  from  head  to  foot. 
Then  he  instructed  the  girl  to  keep  near  Gloria,  always  in  her 
direct  line  of  vision. 

The  scheme  worked  and  presently  Gloria  was  in  a  very  real 
rage  and  demanded  that  "that  old  rose  abomination"  be  re- 
moved from  the  set.  But  what,  you  ask,  was  the  reason  for 
this?  Ah!  Perhaps  Gloria  herself  had  not  stopped  to  analyze 
it,  but  Pola  Negri's  favorite  color  was  old  rose  and  she  wore  it 
more  often  than  any  other  shade. 
At  that  time  there  was  a  bitter  feud 
going  on  between  Negri  and  Swan- 
son  so  it  is  easy  to  see  why  Gloria 
reacted  so  violently  against  that 
color. 

If  you  dig  down  deep  into  your 
own  consciousness  you  can  discover 
the  reasons  for  your  own  color  pref- 
erences, and  when  you  look  at  the 
chart  in  the  light  of  your  new  knowl- 
edge you  will  be  able  to  select  the 
colors  that  will  give  you  the  right 
vibrations  which  will  help  you  along 
the  road  to  success  and  happiness. 

Joan  Crawford  has  always  be- 
lieved she  preferred  blue  because  it 
has  brought  her  good  luck.  She 
wore  it  when  she  danced  in  her  first 
chorus  in  Chicago.  She  was  suc- 
cessful in  holding  her  job  against 
terrific  odds.  In  New  York,  the 
wardrobe  women  always  chose  blue 
for  her.  She  made  good.  When 
she  first  walked  onto  a  picture  lot, 
she  wore  it.  It  gradually  became 
her  "good  luck"  color. 

She  instinctively  turned  from  or- 
chid because  she  felt  it  had  no 
warmth. 

But,  by  glancing  at  our  color 
chart,  we  see  that  Joan  had  good 
luck,  partially  because  she  was  in 
blue.  Nervous,  high-strung,  emo- 
tional people  should  wear  it.  It 
soothes;  gives  them  the  proper  bal- 
ance. If  Joan  had  chosen  red — the 
most  stimulating  color  of  all — her 
taut  nerves  might  have  snapped. 


The  Significance  of  Color 

Blacks  and  dark  browns.    Definitely  depressive. 

Gray.  The  lifting  of  sadness.  A  mixture  of 
black  and  white.  People  who  wear  it  are  often 
in-between  people. 

Red.  The  strongest  vibration  of  all.  A  stimu- 
lant. It  is  sex;  it  is  life.  Many  emotional  people 
cannot  wear  it  because  it  throws  them  into  chaos. 
Slow,  unemotional,  unimaginative  people  seek  it 
to  arouse  emotional  energy. 

Scarlet.  The  come-hither  color.  An  exaggera- 
tion of  red. 

Blue.  It  represents  peace,  harmony  and  home 
and  definitely  refines  and  cools.  Excellent  for  those 
working  at  high  tension. 

Green.  Fresh  green  means  life;  springtime.  It 
is  both  a  sedative  and  a  stimulant,  depending  upon 
the  person.  And  it  is  definitely  the  money-getting 
color;  the  indication  of  the  ultra-ambitious;  the 
intellect. 

Heavy,  dull  green  is  indicative  of  laziness  and 
envy. 

Dull  greens  are  splendid  for  the  nervous,  dy- 
namic character  but  act  almost  as  a  sleeping  po- 
tion  to  the  sloxv-minded. 

Pink.  Youthful  joyousness.  Almost  all  young 
people  should  have  pink  rooms  for  soft  radiations 
while  character  is  forming. 

Purple.  Royalty;  dignity;  glory.  Always  used 
in  religious  rites  and  to  pay  homage  to  royalty, 
church  dignitaries,  etc.  However,  it  is  ponderous 
and  adds  weight. 

Orange.  The  color  of  physical  strength.  It 
tends  to  submerge  all  about  it. 

Yellotv.  The  highest  of  all.  The  sun.  Gaiety; 
joy;  glory;  power;  great  love.  Always  stimulating. 
Lemon  yellow,  however,  is  soothing. 

Orchid.  Indicative  of  spiritual  affections  and 
when  carried  to  great  lengths  forms  a  barrier 
against  love. 


She  might  even  have  been  stimulated  to  emotional  frenzies  so 
that  she  could  not  recognize  opportunities  for  success  when 
they  came  to  her. 

Orchid  is  a  spiritual  color  which,  carried  to  excess,  creates  a 
barrier  against  love.  Joan  seeks  love  as  naturally  as  a  plant 
turns  its  petals  toward  the  warmth  of  the  sun.  She  would  be 
miserable  in  orchid,  the  color  which  opposes  those  natural  emo- 
tions. 

Norma  Shearer  prefers  a  cool,  apple  green.  Her  dressing- 
room  is  done  in  that  shade;  even 
the  telephone  is  enameled  in  it. 
Norma  says  her  love  of  green  comes 
from  having  seen  her  mother  wear 
it  when  Norma  was  a  youngster. 
But  why  did  Norma  instinctively, 
even  as  a  small  child,  like  to  see  her 
mother  wear  it? 

Apple  green  is  the  shade  for  the 
ambitious.  People  who  crave  suc- 
cess and  fame  always  radiate  to  it 
because  it  combines  the  sedative 
qualities  of  the  blue  and  the  money- 
making  ones  of  green.  It  is  per- 
fectly natural  for  Norma  to  say,  "I 
feel  more  comfortable,  more  sure  of 
myself  in  green  than  any  other 
color. " 


UNTIL  the  past  few  months,  she 
has  detested  brown, but  one  day 
a  saleswoman  persuaded  her  to  try 
on  a  brown  dress.  The  lines  were  so 
stunning  that  Norma  could  not  re- 
sist buying  it.  And,  suddenly,  she 
found  that  she  felt  comfortable;  the 
radiations  of  Norma's  nature  and 
the  brown  no  longer  clashed.  She 
has  bought  brown  clothes  several 
times  since. 

A  color  psychologist  would  say 
that  Norma  is  radiating,  now,  to  an 
unhappy  color.  A  dark  brown  (such 
as  Norma  is  wearing)  is  a  calam- 
itous color.  Natalie  Kalmus  says, 
"After  each  war  we  have  a  new- 
cycle  of  colors.  Black  death  has 
stalked  among  us,  laying  us  low  in

MERRILY  WE  GO  TO  HELL— Paramount 


YOU'D  just  not  better  read  this  if  you  hope  to  get  any 
sensible  notion  of  what  the  picture  is  about,  that's  all, 
because  our  case-hardened  reviewers  went  absolutely  gaga 
over  it  and  came  home  sobbing  and  giggling  all  at  once. 

You'll  hate  Fredric  March  for  being  fool  enough  not  to 
love  Sylvia  Sidney,  but  you'll  love  him  for  being  a  charming 
drunkard  with  a  grand  sense  of  humor,  and  such  a  grand 
actor,  doing  his  best  work  yet. 

It  also  seems  Sylvia  is  so  adorable  that  the  preview 
audience,  to  a  man,  burst  into  tears  and  then  cheered.  It 
seems,  further,  that  every  performance  she  turns  in  now- 
adays is  perfect.  Between  bawling  like  a  baby  and  giggling

THE  DARK  HORSE— First  National 


THIS  grand  political  satire,  which  comes  at  the  most 
opportune  of  moments,  will  give  you  enough  chuckles  to 
tide  you  over  a  flock  of  gloomy  days. 

If  you  don't  laugh  at  Guy  Kibbee,  the  "dark  horse"  for 
governor,  and  his  priceless  bewilderment  at  finding  himself 
nominated;  if  you  don't  appreciate  the  flamboyant  acting  of 
Warren  William,  the  whirlwind  campaign  leader;  if  you 
don't  thoroughly  enjoy  Bette  Davis,  Yivienne  Osborne  and 
Frank  McHugh — then  you  should  be  sent  to  bed  without 
your  movies  for  a  whole  month.  Although  the  story  takes 
electoral  conventions  for  a  ride,  politicians  tell  us  it's  as 
much  truth  as  comedy.  Give  yourself  a  treat  and  don't 
miss  a  single  scene  of  this  thoroughly  amusing  picture. 
Kibbee's  howling  show  alone  makes  it  a  must  on  your  list.

RED-HEADED  WOMAN—  M-G-M 


RED-HEADED  and  hot-headed,  the  heroine  of  Kath- 
arine Brush's  best-selling  novel  hits  the  screen!  An 
alluring  girl,  fighting  for  what  she  wants  with  woman's  most 
potent  weapon! 

Jean  Harlow,  platinum  locks  hidden,  is  the  girl.  So  com- 
pletely does  hotsy  Harlow  hurl  herself  into  the  role  that  the 
Hollywood  actress  is  totally  forgotten. 

This  common  little  maid,  from  the  wrong  side  of  the 
tracks,  makes  up  her  mind  to  cross  that  great  divide  and 
seize  her  boss,  Bill  Lcgcndrc.  She  gets  her  man,  but  not  the 
spot  in  Renwood's  400  that  she  craves.  Then,  in  New  York, 
she  plays  a  millionaire  and  his  chauffeur  at  the  same  time. 
Exposed,  she  hurries  back  to  BUI,  and  is  kicked  out.  Bill's 
shot — and  the  last  we  see  of  the  red-head,  she's  in  Paris 
with  a  new  papa  but  the  same  chauffeur. 

Metro  has  done  right  by  this  vigorous  yarn.  The  film  is 
dotted  with  risque  scenes.  The  dialogue  is  screamingly  funny, 
and  the  film  will  certainly  panic  the  grown-ups. 

Una  Merkel,  as  wise-cracking  Sally,  wins  most  of  the 
laughs.  Chester  Morris  is  sincere  and  convincing  as  the 
bewildered  Bill.  Leila  Hyams  is  a  dandy  wronged  wife — ■ 
and  Lewis  Stone,  as  always,  does  a  fine  father.  "  Good 
movie!"    Wow — it  sizzles  and  it  burns!

WHAT  PRICE  HOLLYWOOD— RKO-Pathe 


HERE  you  are,  movie  customers!  All  the  lights,  laughs 
and  heartbreaks  of  Movie-Town!  One  of  the  fastest, 
most  interesting  pieces  of  entertainment  ever  to  come  out  of 
Hollywood!  Mustn't  miss  it!  Gorgeous  Constance  Bennett 
gives  her  finest  performance  as  the  little  blonde  Brown  Derby 
waitress  who  wants  to  get  into  the  movies.  Catching  the  eye 
of  a  famous  but  liquorish  director,  magnificently  played  by 
Lowell  Sherman, she  goes  to  a  big  premiere  with  him.  Into  the 
films  she  goes,  and  the  joys  and  glooms  of  a  star's  life  follow. 

Neil  Hamilton  does  a  great  millionaire  play-boy,  and 
Gregory  Ratoff  's  cartoon  of  a  producer  is  amazing. 

Almost  everything  in  this  picture  has  actually  happened 
in  Hollywood.  A  great  director  really  went  down  and  out  as 
Sherman  does  here.  It's  a  pretty  true  picture  of  what  goes 
on — and  reveals  startlingly  just  how  hard  it  is  to  stay 
married  in  Filmland.  The  movies  have  always  chided 
Photoplay  for  tipping  off  technical  secrets  of  pictures. 
Here  they  give  it  all  away  themselves! 

All  in  all,  one  of  the  finest,  most  fascinating  movies  ever 
made.  It  grabs  the  interest  in  a  death-grip,  and  holds  on. 
Its  authors,  our  own  Adela  Rogers  St.  Johns  and  Jane 
Murfin,  know  every  inch  of  the  Hollywood  scene.  And 
they've  concocted  a  swell  talkie  and  a  box-office  knockout! 


& 


MAKE  ME  A  STAR— Paramount 


WHAT  a  title  for  this  gale  of  mirth!  For  Stuart  Erwin, 
a  perfect  knockout  as  the  movie-struck  boy  from  the 
crossroads,  will  be  a  star  after  this  picture  has  roared  and 
howled  its  way  across  America!  This  talkie  version  of 
Harry  Leon  Wilson's  great  "Merton  of  the  Movies"  is  swell 
entertainment.  Erwin's  performance  is  rib-rattling,  button- 
busting.  And  right  beside  him  charges  Joan  Blondell,  as 
the  hard-boiled  little  fairy-godmother  of  the  lots. 

A  magnificent  blending  of  laughs  and  tears,  with  the 
chuckles  winning.  Moreover,  it's  another  fascinating  expose 
of  picture-making,  with  Hollywood  secrets  paraded.  Whip- 
Eke  dialogue,  smart  direction,  stunning  performances. 
Laurels  to  Director  William  Beaudine  and  to  Sam  Hardy, 
who  plays  a  director.    Certainly  one  of  the  year's  best.

IGLOO— Universal 


A  THRILLING  story  of  the  Eskimo.  His  endless 
struggle  for  existence,  his  constant  battle  against  storm 
and  hunger.  Where  survival  of  the  fittest  is  the  law 
supreme.  Chee-Ak,  a  noble  hunter,  brings  food  to  a  starving 
village,  but  before  the  feast  is  over,  a  bitter  gale  sweeps  the 
little  colony  inside  the  igloos.  Days  pass  with  no  relief  in 
sight.  In  desperation  Chee-Ak  braves  the  storm,  to  find  the 
water  holes  frozen  over.  A  trek  Southward  to  the  sea  is 
decided  upon.  Chee-Ak  leads  them  over  icy  fields.  At  last 
the  sea  is  reached.  The  weary  tribe  finds  itself  caught  in 
an  ice  jam  and  flees  over  melting  ice  to  safety. 

The  entire  cast  is  Eskimo.  Chee-Ak  gives  a  magnificent 
natural  performance.  The  story  is  simply  told.  Director 
Ewing Scott  has  made  "Igloo"  a  picture  well  worth  seeing.

BLESSED 
EVENT— 
Warners 


JANET  GAYNOR  refused  to  make  this  picture.  So  Marian 
Nixon  stepped  in  with  one  of  the  most  charming  performances 
of  the  year,  in  this  idyllic  little  love  story  that  Pickford  did  in 
silents.  A  restful,  reposeful  little  talkie,  lighted  by  Marian's 
lovely  work  and  good  performances  by  Ralph  Bellamy  and 
Louise  Closser  Hale.  Janet,  you  certainly  helped  Marian! 
This  is  a  blessed  relief  from  the  screamies. 


ANOTHER  entry  in  the  great  columnist-picture  sweep- 
stakes, and  a  pippin!  A  real  picture,  with  Lee  Tracy,  that 
chronic  movie  newspaper  man,  hilariously  funny  as  the  boy 
who  prints  news  of  Blessed  Events  before  they  occur.  The 
dialogue  is  great,  and  good  performances  abound.  This  is  the 
sort  of  red-hot  and  moonstruck  madness  that  talkies  do  well — 
and  a  credit  to  all!    Good  old  Lee!

DOCTOR  X— 
First  National 


HERE  he  is — America's  premiere  chatter  columnist  on  the 
loose.  He's  brazen,  restless  and  egotistical — an  American 
institution.  Ricardo  Cortez  gives  the  greatest  show  of  his  life 
as  the  gossip  disher  who  at  last  meets  up  with  the  business  end 
of  a  gun.  Helen  Twelvetrees  turns  in  a  neat  performance  as  a 
"Follies"  lass,  and  Bob  Armstrong  and  ZaSu  Pitts  are  fine. 
Fast,  furious,  punchy.     You'll  like  it. 


TECHNICOLOR  is  startlingly  used  to  deepen  the  mystery 
of  this  creepy  thriller.  Even  though  you've  seen  "  Dracula" 
and  the  rest,  this  shocker  will  give  you  a  tingle!  Dr.  X  tries  to 
find,  among  his  medical  pals  and  students,  a  murderous 
strangler.  Ooooo!  Lionel  Atwill  is  fine  as  the  sleuthing  medico, 
and  Lee  Tracy  (again  a  newspaper  man),  Fay  Wray  and 
Robert  Warwick  help  nobly.    It's  a  good  shiver- film.

PASSAGE—

A  FROTHY,  delightful  society  comedy,  with  Leslie  Howard 
doing  some  of  his  most  charming  acting  as  the  cultured 
head-waiter  who  fights  out  of  his  social  station  to  marry  the 
girl — and  what  a  girl  Elizabeth  Allan  is!  Fine  performances  by 
George  Grossmith  and  Benita  Hume — the  latter  a  great  film 
bet.  This  is  as  slick  as  they  come  in  the  fine  field  of  sophisti- 
cated, frothy  talkie  comedy.

ABIT  more  pep  in  lines  and  acting,  and  this  would  have 
been  an  ace  picture,  for  the  story  is  fine.  Not  even  good 
trouping  by  Ann  Harding  as  the  wife  of  a  temperamental 
novelist  can  save  the  show  from  the  doldrums.  Irving  Pichel 
gives  a  good  show  as  the  plodder  she  later  marries,  and  so  do 
Laurence  Olivier  and  ZaSu  Pitts.  But  this  remains  a  poky, 
unexciting  picture.

THE  MAN 
FROM 

YESTERDAY 
— Paramount 


A  PLEASANT  enough  film  tidbit  for  an  evening  at  the 
movies — not  hot,  but  warm  and  cozy.  Jimmy  Dunn  tries 
his  darndest  to  be  a  tough  boxer  who  steals  the  heart  of  Peggy 
Shannon,  not  quite  believable  as  a  society  gell.  He  doesn't 
quite  make  it — too  nice  a  boy.  As  so  often  happens,  the  picture 
is  practically  walked  off  with  by  big  Spencer  Tracy,  Jimmy's 
tantalizing  trainer. 


A  MODERN  version  of  Enoch  Arden,  with  Claudette 
Colbert  in  the  role  of  wife.  Clive  Brook  is  the  attractive 
first  husband  who  goes  to  war  and  is  later  reported  dead. 
Charles  Boyer  is  the  second  important  man  in  Colbert's  life  and 
she  grows  more  beautiful  as  the  experience  deepens.  Brook's 
fans  will  find  him  as  usual.  And  Colbert  fans  find  their  darling 
very  lovely.

AN  earnest  little  picture  with  an  earnest  little  moral.  Wives, 
it  seems,  shouldn't  work.  Loretta  Young  shows  the  pit- 
falls that  await  the  couple  who  bring  in  the  daily  bread  to- 
gether. Loretta  succeeds  in  her  work  while  Norman  Foster,  the 
husband,  gets  discouraged,  discharged  and  pneumonia  at  the 
same  time.  There  are  bright  spots  throughout  the  picture. 
George  Brent  and  Aline  MacMahon  add  worthwhile  moments. 


A  SOPHISTICATED  piece  of  good  mean  fun — conclusively 
funny  if  you  accept  its  thesis  that  love  is  largely  baloney 
and  divorce  a  necessary  relief  from  marriage  pangs.  Oh  well — 
funny  anyhow!  Adolphe  Menjou  is  the  slick  hero,  Joan  Marsh 
a  bit  of  a  pretty  dumbbell — but  about  the  best  chore  is  turned 
in  by  Minna  Gombell  as  a  marry-for-money  sister.  Really,

THE  ROAR 
OF  THE 
DRAGON— 
Radio  Pictures 


NIFTY  and  smart.  Not  original  but  camouflaged  with 
bright  tinsel.  Joan  Bennett's  a  rich  little  girl  until  the 
depression  makes  her  poor.  But  there  are  still  wealthy  men 
who  like  pretty  women.  Just  when  she's  prepared  to  feather 
her  boudoir  she  meets  the  struggling  artist — capable  Ben  Lyon. 
He  mistakes  her  boudoir  for  one  already  feathered.  Naturally, 
the  complications  end  with  perfect  understanding.    Well  acted. 


SOME  excitement  develops  here  in  beholding  Gwili  Andre, 
Radio's  Garbo  hope.  Pretty,  though  badly  made  up,  but 
she  plays  a  Greta  part  in  the  Mary  Brian  manner.  Merely 
inexperience.  Training  will  do  it.  Exciting  story;  Richard  Dix 
fine;  Arline  Judge  cunning.  Rough  and  tumble  Chinese  bandit 
yarn  that  is  good  entertainment  for  young  and  old.

Hows  This  for  Beauty  Sleep?

click,  directors  snap  or-

Colbert  sleeps  on.  She's 
falling  asleep  at  her  job 
— but  that's  her  job  in 
one  of  the  scenes  of 
"The  Man  from  Yester-

Viertel  stands  at  atten- 
tion at  her  bedside. 
Think  it's  pretty  soft

you  like  it.  Or  maybe 
you  would,  for  the  rather

Have  You 

That 
Desk-Chair  Spread"? 

By  Sylvia 


HUNDREDS  of  thousands  of  fat  girls  and  women 
throughout  the  country  are  performing  miracles  upon 
their  figures. 
Hundreds  of  thousands  of  skinny  girls  are  making 
themselves  look  more  attractive. 

I'm  delighted.    I  could  jump  up  and  click  my  heels  together 
with  joy  because  I've  been  able  to  pound  a  little  sense  into  those 
folks'  heads.    But  there  is  one  group  of  girls  who  don't  please 
me.  Listen,  you  girls  who  sit  all 
day— -you  stenographers, 
secretaries,    detail    workers, 
telephone  operators,  artists, 
writers,  publicity  women, 
buyers!  Listen,  you  girls  who 
tell  me  you  are  chained  to  an 
office  desk  and  are  getting 
fatter  by  the  minute! 

Remember  what  they  used 
to  call  the  "matronly  spread"? 
I  call  that  the  ''desk-chair 
spread"  and  I'm  sick  of  hear- 
ing all  you  girls  whine  about 
it.  You  tell  me  that  because 
your  work  requires  you  to  sit 
for  a  good  part  of  the  day  you 
can't  seem  to  bestir  your- 
selves enough  to  have  the 
beautiful  figure  which  is  every 
woman's  right  and  duty. 
Well,  snap  out  of  that  kind  of 
talk  and  snap  out  of  it  quick. 
You  can  be  as  lovely  as  the 
picture  stars  //  you  work  at 
being  lovely. 

When  stars,  who  are  often 
at  the  studio  under  those  glar- 
ing lights  for  ten  and  twelve 
hours  a  day,  can  find  the  time 
and  the  courage  to  take  my 
exercises  and  my  diets  why 
can't  you,  who  spend  but 
seven  or  eight  hours  in  your 
offices,  do  the  same  thing? 

It's  not  easy,  but  you  can 
follow  the  routine  I've 
mapped  out  in  my  former 
articles  as  well  as  anybody. 
And  you  know  it,  too,  if  you'll 
only  have  a  little  straightfor- 
ward conversation  with  vour- 
self. 


For  Girls  Who   Sit  All  Day 


Sylvia  poses  for  you  in  a  morning  exercise  that  will 
reduce  the  lower  hips  from  two  and  a  half  to  three 
inches  in  a  month.  In  this  position  and  hitching 
yourself  from  side  to  side,  progress  across  the  floor 
— as  if  you  were  walking  in  a  sitting  position.  Go 
back  and  forth  across  your  room  eight  or  ten  times 
like  this.  You  will  feel  the  surplus  flesh  smashing 
off  as  you  move  along.  This  exercise  is  for  every- 
one who  wants  to  reduce  in  that  spot,  but  it  is 
absolutely  essential  for  sedentary  office  workers 


I  realize  that  your  type  of  work  makes  it  doubly  hard  to  take 
off  weight.  I  have  seen  what  constant  sitting  can  do,  but  just 
study  the  exercises  I've  worked  out  especially  for  you.  You 
need  drastic  measures — and  you're  going  to  get  them  from  your 
Aunt  Sylvia.  Xor  am  I  going  to  confine  myself  just  to  office 
workers. 

You  others — the  women  who  are  housewives,  the  women 
with  more  active  jobs,  you  can  all  learn  something  from  what 

I've  got  to  say,  if  you  have 
brains  enough  to  realize  it. 

Thousands  of  letters  ask 
me  this  question,  "  How  can  I 
take  off  that  portion  of  the 
anatomy  on  which  I  sit?" 
"Can  that  part  of  the  body 
ever  be  reduced  or  is  it  a 
hopeless  task?"  Nothing  is 
hopeless;  any  surplus  fat  can 
be  taken  off  and  I  know  it! 
Follow  the  exercise  you'll  find 
on  these  pages,  do  it  regularly 
day  after  day  without  fail, 
and  I'll  guarantee  you'll  take 
off  two  and  a  half  to  three 
inches  in  the  first  month! 
That's  a  promise  and  if  you 
have  enough  stick-to-it-ive- 
ness  to  carry  right  through 
you'll  write  to  me  and  say, 
"Sylvia,  I  didn't  know  it  could 
be  done,  but  I've  done  it." 


BUT,  just  because  you're 
taking  this  exercise  don't 
give  up  the  others.  They  all 
work  together,  hand  and 
glove,  and  every  one  of  them 
is  important.  And  right  now 
I  want  to  tell  you  something. 
You  must  do  these  things 
yourself.  Don't  believe  what 
the  other  girls  tell  you.  Don't 
listen  to  those  friends  who 
say,  "I  think  you  should  do 
this  and  that  and  the  other 
thing."  Do  what  you  think 
is  right,  listen  to  the  small 
voice  of  your  own  common 
sense  and  your  Aunt  Sylvia. 

You  can  look  in  the  mirror. 
You  can  see  how  you  look.

QYLVIA  is  known  throughout  the  world  as  the  beauty  marvel  of 
^SjJollywood.  She  is  responsible  for  many  of  the  beautiful 
figures  you  see  on  the  screen.  For  the  past  five  or  six  years  she 
has  been  making  the  stars  lovely  and  she  has  received  as  high  as 
$100  for  a  half-hour's  treatment.  She  is  the  masseuse  de  luxe  of 
the  film  colony.    But  now  she  devotes  her  time  to  leaching  women 


and  girls  throughout  the  United  States  how  to  do  for  themselves 
what  she  has  done  for  the  actresses.  And  hundreds  of  readers  of 
Photoplay  express  delight  with  results.  Sylvia  is  ninety-five 
pounds  of  concentrated  energy,  and  the  magic  of  her  reducing  and 
form-remedying  knowledge  is  imparted  to  you  each  month  on  these 
pages.     Photoplay  is  the  only  magazine  for  which  she  writes. 


Do  This  When  You  Feel  Jumpy 


You  know  better  than  any- 
one else  what  you  want  to  ac- 
complish with  your  own  fig- 
ure. Set  an  ideal  for  yourself 
and  go  after  that  ideal. 

Many  of  the  office  workers 
who  write  to  me,  and  thou- 
sands of  others  as  well,  ask  me 
what  to  do  for  the  jitters. 
"My  face  is  thin  and  lined 
from  worry,"  one  woman 
wrote.  "I  can't  seem  to  get 
the  proper  rest  at  night  for 
I'm  so  nervous,"  said  another. 
"I  work  at  a  high  tension  all 
day  long  and  when  I  go  to 
bed,  sleep  will  not  come.  Is 
there  any  help?" 

Certainly  there's  help,  you 
poor  darlings.  But,  like 
everything  else  you've  got  to 
do  it  yourself.  I've  told  you 
before  that  seven  hours  sleep 
is  plenty  for  anybody.  But 
it's  got  to  be  good  sleep — 
good,  sound,  restful  sleep,  the 
sort  that  relaxes  your  entire 
body  and  makes  you  wake  up 
ready  to  lick  the  world. 

NOW  I'm  going  to  tell  you 
how  to  accomplish  that 
sort  of  sleep.  You'll  find  an 
exercise  this  month  to  take  in 
bed  that  I  guarantee  will  put 
you  to  sleep  and  make  you 
sleep  hard.  But  if  you  wake 
up  before  daylight  and  are 
restless,  get  up  then — don't 
lie  in  bed  and  toss.  Get  up 
and  do  something — take  a 
shower,  take  some  of  my 
exercises,  give  your  face  a 
good  treatment.  Stay  up  from 
then  on  and  you'll  find  that  the  next  night  you'll  be  so  sleepy 
and  tired  you'll  drop  right  off. 

I've  also  given  you  this  month  a  little  facial  exercise  that  I 
gave  Ruth  Chatterton.  She  told  me  that  no  matter  how  nerv- 
ous she  was,  that  put  her  right  to  sleep.  I'm  passing  it  on  to 
you  and  I  tell  you  to  do  it  every  night  before  you  settle  down. 
Do  it  in  bed  and  don't  mind  if  you  fall  asleep  with  the  cold 


With  head  thrown  forward  in  this  position,  arms 
stretched  tight,  move  slowly  from  side  to  side  and 
then  relax.  Repeat  eight  or  ten  times  or  until  you 
feel  yourself  becoming  less  nervous.  Be  sure  to 
feel  the  spine  pulling,  especially  at  the  back  of  the 
neck.  A  tight  neck  makes  you  jumpy.  This  will 
relax  those  tense  muscles  in  just  a  few  minutes 


cream  still  on  your  face.  Be- 
sides, this  little  exercise  will 
entirely  relax  your  face  and 
take  away  those  tired,  worry 
lines. 

But  what  are  you  to  do  if 
you  have  the  jitters  during 
the  day?  What  will  you  do 
when  that  time  comes  when 
you  feel  as  if  you  must  scream 
from  sheer  nervous  tension? 
First  of  all,  don't  scream.  In- 
stead, get  the  muscles  in  your 
neck  loosened  up.  Did  you 
know  that  the  tightness  at 
the  back  of  the  neck  is  the 
direct  result  of  nerves?  Then 
take  the  exercise  I  give  you 
this  month  for  that.  You  can 
shut  your  office  door  and  do 
it  for  a  few  minutes.  You  can 
do  it  at  night  before  you  go 
to  bed.  Five  minutes  of  this 
exercise  makes  you  feel  like 
a  brand-new  woman.  You 
won't  want  to  scream  when 
you've  got  your  neck  and 
back  limbered  up. 

Here's  another  thing.    Be- 
cause I  feel  so  sorry  for  nerv- 
ous people  I  hate  to  say  this, 
but  you  nervous  girls  are  self- 
ish.    You  think  too  much 
about  yourselves.    When  you 
begin  to  feel  jumpy,  get  up 
and  look  out  of  the  window. 
Find  the  most   interesting 
thing  you  can  see  in  the  street 
and  concentrate  on  that 
thing,  even  if  it's  only  a  piece 
of  paper  blowing  in  the  wind. 
Get  out  of  yourself.     Think 
about  something  else,  no  mat- 
ter what  it  is. 
If  you're  nervous  you'll  have  a  faulty  digestion.     But  my 
diets  contain  everything  you  need.     However,  take  as  much 
liquid  food  as  possible.     Often  the  most  nervous  people  are 
thin.    On  the  general  building-up  diet  I've  given  plenty  of  milk. 
If  a  lot  of  milk  is  hard  for  you  to  digest,  here's  the  way  to  take 
the  milk.    Chew  it.    Sounds  crazy?    I  mean  it.    Take  a  mouth- 
ful of  milk  and  move  it  around      [  please  turn  to  page  112  ] 


This  Will  Put 
You  To   Sleep 


Do  this  lying  in  bed  with  hands  clutching  the  head  of  the  bed. 
Tense  every  muscle  in  your  body.  Feel  your  whole  body  becom- 
ing tight.  Don't  let  a  single  muscle  escape  your  notice,  or  it 
will  not  be  so  effective.  Then  relax.  Repeat  until  you  feel 
yourself  slipping  off  to  sleep.  If  you  get  seven  hours  sleep 
after  taking  this  exercise  it  will  mean  everything  to  your  beauty

Durante

YOU'LL  find  Mr.  Durante  in  his  den,''  softly  announced 
the  eunuch-voiced  footman,  and  following  his  direc- 
tions, I  went  up  two  flights  of  marble  stairs  and  dis- 
covered the  object  of  my  search  comfortably  ensconced 
in  a  deep  arm  chair,  his  feet  on  a  low  table.  Nearby,  an  old- 
fashioned  music  box  tinkled  sweet,  sentimental  music.  He  was 
smoking  a  cigar  and  as  he  did  not  at  first  notice  my  entrance  I 
had  a  moment  to  observe  the  tempestuous  Great  Lover  in 
repose. 

His  feet,  such  as  they  were,  were  encased  in  dark  purple 

58 


brocaded  slippers,  which  were  a  perfect  match  for  his  bright 
orange  dressing  gown  and  mauve  toque.  His  nose,  which 
shook  when  he  laughed  like  a  bowl  full  of  jelly,  was  resting 
quietly  on  his  chest  and  seemed  somewhat  fatigued — possibly 
from  being  so  frequently  referred  to.  On  seeing  me,  however, 
it  lifted  quickly  up  and  graciously  waved  me  into  a  seat  by 
the  fire. 

I  sat  down  nervously  and  arose  almost  immediately,  as 
what  I  had  unfortunately  mistaken  for  a  bench  turned  out  to 
be  a  little  extra  girl,  one  or  two  of  whom  Mr.  Durante  always

Alone  with  his 
memories  of  love, 
the  great  screen 
lover  dreams  of 
his  conquests 
while  his  price- 
less antique  mu- 
sic box  tinkles 
"In  the  Shade  of 
the  Old  Apple 
Tree."  Strangely 
enough,  this  bal- 
lad recalls  poign- 
antly to  him  his 
early  loves  among

carts on  the  East 
Side  of  New  York

charitably  keeps  around  the  house,  for  the  Great  Lover  is 
anything  if  not  kind  to  those  less  fortunate  than  himself. 
However,  when  the  laughter  at  my  curious  mishap  had  some- 
what subsided,  he  dismissed  his  little  companion  and  I  was 
alone  at  last  with  the  Don  Juan  of  the  talking  screen. 

The  den  itself  was  a  curious  mixture  of  old  world  romance 
and  modern  plumbing.  Over  the  fireplace,  in  which  lay  the 
dying  embers  of  what  must  have  been  at  one  time  a  very 
successful  fire,  hung  an  enormous  overstuffed  Moose  head, 
whose  resemblance  to  my  host  was  somewhat  startling.     I 


commented  on  this  and  he  informed  me  his  uncle  had  been  a 
Moose. 

"So  you  stuff  uncles,"  I  remarked,  and  then,  taking  the  lion 
by  the  horns,  I  asked  him  about  his  recent  affair  with  Greta 
Garbo. 

"Who?"  asked  Mr.  Durante. 

I  repeated  the  name. 

"Garbo?"  he  mused,  "Garbo? — is  she  on  this  lot?" 

I  assured  him  that  she  was — at  least  up  to  her  recent  de- 
parture for  her  native  Sweden.  His  eyes  suddenly  lighted  up.

"You  see,"  says 
Jimmy,  "you  gotta 
put  all  your  soul 
in  a  kiss  to  make 
it  click.  For  in- 
stance," and  he 
grabbed  up  one  of 
his  dolls  to  demon- 
strate,"anyguy  who 
knows  as  much  as  I 
do  about  love  never 
makes  any  noise 
when  he  smacks 
'em.  Once  I  put 
over  the  big  kissing 
act,  they're  sunk" 


"Oh,  sure,"  he  said,  "that  Swedish  girl."  And  a  faintly 
reminiscent  smile  played  over  his  lips.  "Say,  whatever  be- 
came of  her?" 

"She's  gone  back  to  her  own  country,"  I  said. 

"That's  right,"  he  agreed  cheerfully,  "and  maybe  I  wasn't 
glad  to  get  her  out  of  here." 

"What  do  you  mean?"  I  inquired. 

"Oh,  you  know  how  women  are,"  was  his  answer. 

"I'm  afraid  I  don't,"  I  replied,  and  then,  quickly,  "How 
are  women?" 

The  Casanova  of  Cahuenga  Canyon  stroked  his  nose  thought- 
fully for  a  few  minutes  before  replying: 

"I'll  tell  you  about  women,"  he  said  at  last,  and  the  room 
became  very  quiet.  "They're  a  funny  lot.  You  take  what's  her 
name  .  .  ." 

"I'd  love  to,"  I  agreed,  "what  is  her  name?" 

"I  only  know  her  first  name,"  he  answered.  "It  begins 
withLupe." 

"Lupe  Yelez?"  I  suggested. 

"That's  it,"  he  said,  his  face  lighting  up.  "The  French 
girl." 

"I  think  she's  Mexican,"  I  suggested. 

"Sure,"  he  agreed,  "Mexican — French — those  foreigners 
are  all  alike." 

"When  did  you  know  Miss  Velez?"  I  asked. 

"Let  me  see,"  he  mused.     "When  was  the  earthquake?" 

"The  earthquake  of  October  3,  1929?"  I  asked. 

"That's  the  one."  he  replied.  "Well,  sir,  I  was  new  to 
pictures  in  those  days  and  all  I  can  remember  on  that  date  is 
meeting  Lupe  at  the  Brown  Derby  and  then  everything  went 
black,  and  chimneys  began  tumbling  down,  and  when  I  came 
to,  Lupe  and  I  were  in  Agua  Caliente." 

"Quite  an  earthquake,"  I  commented. 

PRECISELY,"  he  agreed.  "And  then  there  was  Polly 
Moran."  His  eyes  closed  momentarily  as  though  he  were 
dreaming.  "I  can  see  her  now,"  he  purred,  "dancing  her  exotic 
dances  in  the  native  quarter  of  Hong-Kong.  She  was  a  Nautch 
girl — in  fact,  at  the  time  I  met  her,  she  was  the  Cat's  Nautch." 

The  embers  of  the  fireplace  blazed  up  momentarily  at  this, 
and   then   died   out   completely. 

"She  must  have  seen  me  watching  her  in  the  crowd,"  he 
continued,  "for  I  felt  that  she  was  dancing  only  for  me.  When 
she  had  finished,  I  gave  the  cry  of  the  bull-ape  and  the  crowd 


fled  in  terror,  leaving  us  alone.  I  craved  an  introduction,  but 
as  we  did  not  seem  to  have  any  mutual  friends,  I  walked  for- 
ward beating  on  my  chest  and  saying, '  Me,  Jimmy  Durante  —  me 
wantta  be  introduced.'  At  first  the  poor  girl  was  frightened 
and  ran  up  a  nearby  cocoanut  tree  from  where  she  com- 
menced to  shower  me  with  the  luscious  native  fruit.  Un- 
daunted, I  took  from  my  pocket  a  small  piccolo  and  began  to 
play.  She  was  fascinated.  She  slowly  descended.  I  waited 
until  she  was  within  ten  paces  of  me  and  then  gave  her 
this." 

Mr.  Durante  illustrated  "this"  by  flashing  at  me  an  intense 
look  from  those  burning  eyes,  coupled  with  a  slight  opening  and 
closing  of  his  nostrils  and  I  felt  myself  swooning. 

"JIMMY,"  I  murmured,  and  he  leaped  hastily  up  and  dashed 
J  a  glass  of  cold  water  (which  he  always  keeps  hand}-  for  such 
purposes)  over  my  face. 

"Sorry,  old  man,"  he  muttered,  "sometimes  I  forget  my  own 
power." 

"That's  perfectly  all  right,"  I  assured  him,  taking  a  position 
a  little  farther  away  and  putting  on  a  pair  of  smoked  glasses, 
which  he  offered  me.    "Please  go  on." 

"Well,  to  make  a  long  story  short,"  continued  my  host. 
"where  was  I?" 

"You  had  just  given  her  'this,'  "  I  replied,  "only  don't  do 
it  again." 

"Well,"  he  went  on,  "she  stood  there  transfixed  and  I  once 
more  adjusted  my  flute  to  my  lips  and  played  an  old  Indian 
love  song  and  she  began  to  dance.  Never  in  my  life  have  I 
seen  such  a  performance." 

"I  can  imagine,"  I  agreed. 

"When  she  had  finished,  I  once  more  took  off  my  hat  and 
emitted  the  cry  of  the  bull-ape,  but  this  time  she  was  not 
afraid.  She  smiled  and  in  that  curious  lilting  voice  of  hers,  she 
said,  "Me,  Polly  Moran." 

"Me,    Jimmy    Durante,"    I    replied. 

"Polly  Moran." 

"Jimmv  Durante." 

"Polly." 

"Jimmy." 

"Jimmv." 

"Polly." 

"This  went  on  for  several  minutes,  at  the  end  of  which  I 
blew  a  small  whistle  and  this         [  please  turn  to  page  118  ]

Hollywood 
Speaks — 
Fashionably 


WHEN  you  want  to  inject  a  little 
real  glamour  into  the  clothes 
budget — buy  a  hostess  gown!  This 
stunning  one,  shown  below,  is  worn 
by  Hedda  Hopper  in  "As  You  Desire 
Me."  Gray  crepe  swathes  her  figure 
in  slim,  sculptured  lines.  Chinchilla  fur 
cuffs  fall  gracefully  above  a  fitted 
wristline.  The  side  drape  forms  a  train 
extending  from  the  back  of  the  neckline. 


HERE  is  what  is  meant  by  a  coat  that  looks  like  a  dress.  This 
distinctive  costume,  at  left  above,  is  also  worn  by  Hedda 
Hopper  in  "As  You  Desire  Me."  The  coat  is  made  with  a 
straight  skirt,  wrapping  to  the  side,  where  it  is  held  by  a  belt 
of  the  material.  The  scarf-like  collar  is  draped  to  the  left  shoulder 
where  it  is  held  by  a  strap  buttoning  over.  Be  sure  to  note  that 
the  sleeves  in  all  three  of  Hedda's  costumes  show  fullness 
bloused  above  the  elbow.  The  soft  woolen  of  this  coat  is  a  rich 
yellow-green  in  tone.     Hedda's  hat  has  a  high  back  ribbon  trim. 


HEDDA  ought  to  enter  "the  best-dressed"  competition  in 
Hollywood — she  knows  what  is  smart  and  how  to  wear  it. 
Look  at  this  white  coat,  at  right  above — isn't  it  a  knockout?  Its 
lines  are  similar  to  the  green  woolen  except  that  it  closes  nearer 
the  center  and  stresses  a  collarless  line.  And  the  material  shows 
a  definite  ribbed  texture.  There's  a  hint  for  you  in  the  trick  tie 
of  that  black  and  white  plaided  taffeta  scarf.  The  plaid  is  used 
again  for  accent  on  the  pertly  tilted  white  hat.  A  perfect  outfit 
for  rounding  out  the  summer  smartly.    It's  in  "As  You  Desire  Me." 


DOESN'T  Helen  Twelvetrees  look  as  if  she  might  have  stepped  from 
a  picture  of  another  century?  Yet  her  charming  white  organdie 
frock  is  the  picture  of  modern  chic.  Just  what  you  should  be  wearing 
these  summer  evenings,  in  fact.  Helen's  flaring  skirt  is  deeply  tucked, 
while  petals  of  the  material  edge  the  sleeves  and  decorate  the  corsage 
of  her  brief  peplum  bodice.  That  high  buttoned  neckline  is  flatteringly 
naive.  And  how  many  of  you  are  going  to  sit  through  "Without  Shame" 
several  times  so  that  you  can  tell  the  hairdresser  just  how  to  do  those 
ringlet  bangs^ 


THE  straight,  slim  silhouette  is 
smartly  endorsed  by  Gene- 
vieve Tobin  in  this  suit  which  she 
wears  in  "Hollywood  Speaks." 
Made  of  heavy  black  silk,  her 
skirt  follows  the  straight  and 
narrow.  The  cape  on  her  silk 
jacket  is  lined  with  the  same 
white  crepe  that  cleverly  accents 
her  skirt.  Genevieve  s  blouse, 
shown  in  the  sketch,  is  white  lace 
and  is  fastened  with  novel  black 
clips      The  girdle  is  black  satin. 


Three  Youthful  Styles 


NEW  PICTURES 
GIVE  SMART 
TIPS  FOR  AN 
EARLY  FALL 
WARDROBE 


yOU  will  find  Joan  Bennett  wearing  a  perfect 
lounging  outfit  for  college  in  her  new  picture, 
"Week-Ends  Only."  You  see  Joan  in  it,  above, 
and  the  sketch  gives  you  details.  A  frilly  pink  guimpe 
is  topped  by  jumper  pajamas  of  blue  silk.  The  guimpe 
type  of  thing  is  much  seen  around  Hollywood — and 
will  be  about  campuses,  too.  Be  sure  to  notice 
Joan's  bracelet  made  entirely  of  silver  stars — isn  t 
it  a  novel  new  gadget  to  add  to  your  collection? 


MARY  BRIAN  wears  a  number  of  stunning  out- 
fits in  her  role  of  young  newspaper  woman  in 
"Blessed  Event."  This  suit  is  particularly  smart — it 
looks  toward  fall.  The  smooth  woolen  is  billiard 
green.  The  trim  jacket  buttons  to  one  side  and  has 
a  flattering  collar  of  silver  fox.  The  straight  skirt 
again!  Under  that  jacket  is  a  feminine  looking 
blouse  in  a  lighter  green  crepe.  Mary's  turban  is 
green  crepe,  her  bag  a  lighter  green  but  blending 
leather  and  her  shoes  match  the  suit  in  color. 


yOU  can  wear  Myrna 
Loy's  type  of  tweed 
dress  right  on  into  fall.  Isn't 
it  gay  and  young  with  its 
puffed  sleeves  and  round 
collar  with  big  bow  of  plaid 
taffeta?  The  two-piece  ef- 
fect is  new— you  are  going 
to  see  lots  of  it.  Brown 
wooden  buttons  and  brown 
accessories  give  effective 
contrast.  Myrna's  beret  is 
the  same  tweed  stitched  all 
over.  Myrna,  as  a  dashing 
French  countess,  wears  this 
in  "Love  Me  Tonight."

HUTH  CHATTERTON  likes  this  brown  tweed 
l>  cape-suit  so  well  which  she  wears  in  "Chil- 
dren of  Pleasure"  that  she  is  taking  it  on  her 
vacation  trip  to  Europe.  The  long  cape  with  wide 
shawl  collar  is  a  new  fashion  note.  It  is  lined 
with  the  brown  and  white  silk  that  forms  her 
scarf.  Note  the  patch  pockets  with  novel  tab 
buttoning.  And  that  big  brooch  is  a  favorite  type 
of  scarf  ornament  with  the  stars

T  IS  said  that  Ruth  Chatterton  dislikes  fashion  pictures  of 
herself — yet  she  persists  in  wearing  unusually  smart  clothes 
that  cry  out  to  be  shown.  In  her  new  picture  "Children  of 
Pleasure"  she  has  a  stunning  wardrobe.  One  of  the  charming 
gowns  is  this  one  of  white  chiffon  with  sweeping  skirt  the 
hem   of  which   is   hand  painted   in  a   brilliant  flower  design. 

The  drop  shoulder  of  the  frock  is  further  stressed  by  an 
ingenious  ermine  capelet.  In  the  sketch  you  can  see  how  it 
ties  in  the  back,  quite  reversing  the  order  of  most  fur  capes. 


sn't  it  a  grand  fashion  tip  for  all  of  you? 


BLUE  fox  encircling  the  neckline 
and  extending  over  the  arms  gives 
shoulder  interest  to  a  blue  wool  suit 
Ruth  wears  in  her  new  picture. 


Here  are  a  few  tips  to  help  you  solve  the  puzzle.    All  of  the  men  are  married.     One  is  noted  for  frivolous       ) 
roles  and  the  other  two  for  heavy  drama.     Two  came  from  the  stage  and  one  played  in  an  orchestra. 
One  of  the  girls  has  been  recently  married,  one  recently  divorced  and  the  other,  the  youngest,  is  a  divorcee 
of  several  years.    Two  of  them  have  children.     One  was  a  famous  stage  star.     One  is  the  daughter  of  an 
army  officer,  one  the  daughter  of  a  great  stage  star.      Two  are  blonde  and  one  has  brown  hair.

Will  Clark  Gable  Last? 


CLARK  GABLE  has  pho- 
tographic virility.  Has  he 
photographic  versatility? 
Between  these  two 
words  lies  the  answer  to  Holly- 
wood's burning  question  of  the 
month. 

Three  months  ago  you  weren*t 
popular  in  Hollywood  unless  you 
were  raving  about  Clark. 

Today,  you're  not  in  the 
conversational  running  unless 
you   can   give  a   lot   of   good   reasons   why   he   won't   last. 

Cruel?  Heartless?  Sure — but  that's  Hollywood  and  cer- 
tainly Clark  Gable  knows  the  town.  He's  had  plenty  of  ex- 
perience with  Hollywood's  cruelty  both  before  and  after  his 
tremendous  success. 

Let's  consider  the  facts  in  the  case. 

Clark,  like  Garbo,  introduced  a  new  vogue  in  screen  per- 
sonality. He  became  the  pattern  from  which  screen  idols  who 
followed  him  were  moulded.  He  is  the  epitome  of  the  ruthless, 
handsome,  knock-'em-down,  treat-'em-rough  he-man,  the 
strong,  virile,  modern  cave  man.  And  not  only  women  in 
Keokuk  and  Medicine  Hat  went  crazy 
about  Clark,  but  the  actresses  of  Holly- 
wood as  well.  Once  he  had  become  a  sensa- 
tion, Hollywood  backed  up  the  public's 
preference. 

Now,  just  as  long  as  women  remain  in- 
terested in  that  type  of  man,  he  will  last — 
provided  the  studios  give  him  that  type  of 
role. 

But  when  women  change  their  minds? 
When  a  new  screen  hero  comes  to  replace 
the  old— what  then?  Will  Clark  Gable  be 
able  to  change  his  type  of  screen  behavior? 
Why  not  be  honest  about  it!  Can  he  act — 
as  Leslie  Howard  can,  for  example? 


THERE  were  numerous  protests  from  his 
vast  public  when  he  played  the  role  of  a 
minister  in  '"Polly  of  the  Circus."  Those 
who  have  seen  "Strange  Interlude"'  in 
which  he  has  one  of  the  greatest  acting 
chances  of  the  screen,  say  that  Xorma 
Shearer  tucks  the  picture  under  her  arm 
and  leisurely  walks  away  with  it.  This  is 
not  so  much  a  discredit  to  Clark  as  it  is  a 
tribute  to  Xorma 's  superb  acting. 

Whether  Clark  wears  the  garb  of  a  minister 
or  changes,  as  he  does  in  "Strange  Inter- 
lude," from  a  young  man  to  an  old  man,  he 
remains  Clark  Gable,  they  say.  Costume, 
make-up,  characterization — all  are  sub- 
merged in  his  own  personality.  Leslie 
Howard,  on  the  other  hand,  has  already 
proved  that  he  can  play  a  variety  of  roles. 

Hollywood  will  tell  you  all  these  things 
to  bear  out  its  argument  that  Gable  can't 
last,  but  I  believe  that  Hollywood  has 
overlooked  one  salient  point. 

Last  October,  Clark  said  that  he  wanted 
to  remain  in  pictures  just  two  years  and  it 
is  my  firm  belief  that  he  will  last  just  as 
long  as  he  wants  to. 

He  is  perfectly  willing  to  retire  when  he 
has  made  enough  money  to  be  independent 
of  public  opinion.  Clark  has  asked  but  one 
thing  of  life.  And  that's  independence, 
with  enough  money  to  live  as  he  pleases 
thrown  in  for  good  measure. 

By  nature,  he  is  an  "I  will  do  as  I  please 
and  say  what  I  please"  person. 


Hollywood  accuses  him  of 
being  just  one  of  those  "per- 
sonality" boys   rather   than 


a  great  and  versatile  actor 


Br  Rn  tli  Biery 


Much  to  their  bewilderment, 
his  producers  discovered  this  early 
in  his  career  and  that  is  why  they 
encouraged  him  to  avoid  as  many 
interviews  as  possible  and  insist 
that  he  leave  town  as  soon  as  each 
picture  is  finished. 

This    determined,    immovable 
trait  in  Gable's  character  is  what 
stops  him  from  being  versatile  on 
the  screen.     He  is  as  he  is — and 
will  always  be.    Versatility  is  the 
ability  to  change  with  each  characterization  a  screen  story  de- 
mands— to  feel  as  if  one  were  a  hundred  different  people.    Of 
that  Clark  Gable  is  almost  incapable. 

Clark  is  not,  by  nature,  a  brilliant  man.  Determined,  yes, 
and  ambitious — but  even  his  ambition  takes  a  single  path,  the 
end  of  which  is  independence.  What  Clark  wants  is  money — 
not,  mind  you,  for  its  own  sake,  but  merely  so  that  he  can  have 
the  sort  of  life  he  wants,  while  he  is  still  voung  enough  to  enjov 
it  fully. 

Naturally,  even  a  person  as  determined  as  he,  must  make 
concessions  to  Hollywood.  One  of  [  please  turn  to  page  113  ] 


But  when  Clark  played  with  Norma  Shearer  in  "A  Free  Soul," 
Norma's  fine  performance  paled  beside  the  brisk  virility  of  Gable. 
In  this,  the  picture  that  brought  him  fame,  he  created  a  type — the 
brutal,  knock-'em-around  hero — and  became  a  sensation  overnight. 
Until    recently    he    has    continued   playing   that   same    sort   of   role

CLARK  GABLE  had  eighteen  tests  made  before  he  got 
a  role.  His  first  good  part  was  that  of  a  plumber 
without  sex  appeal,  in  "The  Easiest  Way." 

When  they  cast  Johnny  Weissmuller  in  "Tarzan, 
the  Ape  Man,"  they  said  to  him,  "This  will  be  a  great  picture 
for  the  kids.  Grown-ups  won't  go  for  it,  but  little  boys  will 
love  it." 

Helen  Hayes  hung  around  Hollywood  for  months.  They 
wouldn't  give  her  a  part  because  they  didn't  think  she  would 
photograph  well  enough. 

"That  James  Cagney  is  all  right  in  secondary  gangster  roles 
— but  he'll  never  be  a  star."  Honest  Injun,  that  was  Holly- 
wood's opinion! 

And  as  for  Garbo — well,  you  know 
that  one.  "  What  can  a  big  Swedish  girl 
who  can't  wear  clothes  do  in  the 
movies?"  is  what  they  said  about  her. 

But  there  was  a  boy  named  Walter 
Pidgeon.  Hollywood  raved  about  him. 
"He's  got  everything,"  they  said  over 
the  coffee  cups  at  Henry's,  "looks, 
charm,  manner,  a  grand  singing  voice. 
That  lad  will  be  the  sensation  of  talkies." 
■  And  as  for  Alexander  Gray — they 
couldn't  say  enough  nice  things  about 
him.  He  was  handsome.  He  could  sing. 
He  had  sex  appeal.     Why,  in  just  no  ^ 

time  at  all  it  was  a  cinch  for  him  and 
Bernice  Claire  to  give  Charlie  Farrell 

and  Janet  Gaynor  a  run  for  their  greenbacks  as  a  knock-'em 
dead  box-office  team. 

And  there  was  a  lad  named  John  Wayne.  Didn't  he  look  like 
Gary  Cooper?  Wasn't  he  typical  of  clean  American  manhood? 
Wasn't  he  good  looking  and  just  the  sort  of  fellow  that  all  the 
girls  would  go  for?  Hollywood  prophesied  that  John  Wayne's 
future  would  be  brighter  than  Peggy  Hopkins  Joyce's  dia- 
monds. 

So  then  what  happened? 

Listen! 

Clark  Gable  played  the  role  of  a  plumber  and  eight  million 
women    wrote   to    M-G-M    and   said,   "If   there   were   more 
plumbers  like  that  I'd  never  leave  the 
kitchen." 

For  every  kid  that  saw  "Tarzan,  the 
Ape   Man,"   there   were   twenty   women

who  asked,  "Where  has  this  Weissmuller  been  all  my  movie 
life?"  You  know  what  happened  to  Helen  Hayes,  Jimmy 
Cagney  and  Garbo — none  of  whom  were  hot  shots  according 
to  Hollywood. 

And  the  Hollywood  hot  shots — the  ones  whose  future  was 
all  in  the  bag?  Walter  Pidgeon  may  be  singing  sweetly  in  some 
girl's  ear,  but  there's  no  microphone  there  to  pick  it  up. 
Alexander  Gray  croons  over  the  radio.  Bernice  Claire?  Who 
knows  where  she  is?  You'll  see  John  Wayne  in  an  occasional 
"quickie." 

So  maybe  by  now  you've  got  the  idea  that  when  it  comes  to 
picking  stars  Hollywood  knows  less  about  it  than  your  Aunt 
Eloise.  In  reality,  your  Aunt  Eloise  is  the  one  who  picks 
them.  You,  way  up  there  in  North 
Dakota,  and  you,  along  the  levees  of 
the  Mississippi,  and  you  from  Keokuk, 
Medicine  Hat  and  Walla  Walla — you  are 
the  real  casting  directors  of  Hollywood. 
You  pick  the  stars  — and  make  no  mis- 
take about  that. 


ALL  sorts  of  money  may  be  spent  on 
publicity,  on  fine  productions,  on 
capable  directors,  but  if  you  turn  thumbs 
down  on  a  player  the  player  will  never 
become  a  star.  And  nine  times  out  of 
ten  Hollywood  is  wrong  about  star  ma- 
terial. 

You  see,  Hollywood  is  a  funny  town, 
bv  charm.    Walter  Pidgeon  is  a  shining

And  it  is  often  fooled 
example. 

Randolph  Scott  is  a  Hollywood  rave  at  the  moment.  The 
girls  around  the  studios  all  go  for  him  in  a  big  way.  The  studio 
has  prophesied  his  success,  but  so  far  he  has  not  registered  on 
the  screen.  True,  he  had  only  a  bit  in  "  Sky  Bride."  But  Gary 
Cooper  had  only  a  bit  in  "  Wings."  Yet  the  minute  he  walked 
before  the  cameras  you  spotted  him.  He  had  that  something 
it  takes.  Gary  is  another  whom  Hollywood  thought  just  a  bad 
actor.    His  stardom  came  because  of  you — the  audience. 

I  sometimes  think  that  being  well  liked  personally  in  Holly- 
wood is  the  worst  possible  omen  for  a  film  career.  There's  the 
case  of  Billy  Haines.  You  made  him  a 
star.  And  then  Billy  bought  a  big  house 
and  became  a  social  light.  His  career 
took  a  down-  [  please  turn  to  page  124] 


What  Red  Hair  Did  To  A 
Platinum  Blonde 


A  FRIEND  who  had   not 
seen  Jean  Harlow  since 
she  left  Hollywood  to  do 
personal  appearances  met  her 
on  the  lot  not  long  ago. 

"Why,   Jean,"  the  friend 
gasped,   "I   wouldn't  have 

known  you  —  you  look  more,  more  ..."      "Say  it,"  Jean 
laughed.     "More  human.     Yes,  and  I  am,  too. " 

And  that  is  one  of  the  things  that  red  hair  has  done  to  the 
platinum  blonde. 

Whether  it  was  the  strangeness  of  that  platinum  hair — 
cold  and  white,  like  an  arctic  midday,  or  whether  it  was  the 
frozen  glamour  it  seemed  to  cast  over  her  personality,  no  one 
knows,  but  Jean  Harlow  was  an  enigma  to  Hollywood.  In 
spite  of  the  very  warm  roles  she  played  on  the  screen,  there  was 
a  standofhshness  about  the  girl  herself. 

"She  is  only  a  kid,"  a  Hollywood  gossiper  once  said,  "but 
she  looks  like  a  woman  who  has  lived  forever  and  loathed  every 
day  of  it.    She's  sort  of  frozen  inside. " 

But  that  was  before  Jean  was  cast  as  the  lead  in  "Red- 
Headed  Woman."  Folks  thought  giving  her  the  role  was 
ridiculous  until  she  put  on  the  red  wig.  And  then  Holly- 
wood couldn't  believe  its  eyes.     Neither  could  Jean. 

For  when  the  platinum  locks  were  covered  up  by  the  red  wig 
Jean's  air  of  boredom  and  the  icy  barrier  that  set  her  apart 
from  the  world  was  gone.  She  suddenly  became  real,  human, 
understandable. 

The  first  day,  she  bounded  on  the  set  like  a  kid  just  let 
out  of  school — and  snapped  right  into  the  role.  That  flaming 
wig  became  the  torch  song  of  youth  and  Jean  immediately 
became  alive,  real  and  vivid. 

When  you  see  her  in  "Red-Headed  Woman"  you'll  find 


It  changed  her  looks  and  her 
personality  and  made  her  able 
to  play  a  role  half  the  girls  in 
Hollywood  so  badly  wanted 


Here's  the  Jean  Harlow  you  used  to  know 
— aloof,  mysterious,  icy.  On  the  screen 
she  was  a  siren,  but  a  cold,  calculating  one 


her  playing  a  hussy,  it  is  true, 
but  there  is  humanness  com- 
bined with  her  badness.     You 
hate  that  girl  in  the  film,  but 
maybe    you   can    sympathize 
just  a  little  with  her — which 
is  more  than  you've  ever  been 
able  to  do  with  any  of  Jean's  other  characterizations.     It's 
amazing  to  see  her  change,  right  under  your  fascinated  eyes. 
She  arrives  at  the  studio  with  her  own  platinum  hair — aloof, 
mysterious,  her  sex-appeal  in   an   ice-box.     She  goes  to  her 
dressing-room  and  has   the   wig   adjusted.     And   becomes  a 
bright,  snappy  little  hoyden — a  brand-new  Jean  Harlow.     So 
much  for  what  red  hair  has  done  to  a  platinum  soul. 

NOW  take  a  look  at  Photoplay's  cover.  Would  you  know 
it  was  Jean  Harlow — this  young,  charming  girl?  Her 
face  is  soft,  her  eyes,  although  still  heavy-lidded,  are  clear  and 
honest.  And  that  mouth,  full  and  lush  as  it  is,  is  almost  naive. 
Isn't  it  an  amazing  transformation? 

But  wait — we're  not  through  yet. 

When  Jean  was  being  a  platinum  blonde  all  day  she  had  no 
steady  beaus.  Men  were  fascinated  by  her  but  there  was 
something  strange  about  her.  "I  can't  seem  to  understand 
that  dame,"  one  lad  said. 

But  now?  Well,  the  villagers  gasped  when  Jean  and  Paul 
Bern,  Hollywood's  most  eligible  bachelor  (an  M-G-M  exec- 
utive) went  down  to  City  Hall  and  filed  intention  to  wed — 
just  like  that.  Folks  thought  that  Paul  would  never  marry, 
but  when  you  see  him  look  at  Jean  there's  no  doubt  about  his 
loving  her. 

So  there  you  are — and  that's  what  red  hair  did  to  a  platinum 
blonde. 


Now  look  at  the  new,  red-headed  Jean — a 
gay,  youthful  hoyden.  PHOTOPLAY'S  cover 
this  month  shows  you  the  color  of  her  hair

ANITA  LOUISE  illustrates  an  ideal

uelle  type.  Hair  of  this  kind  should  be 
persuaded  into  an  aura  for  the  face 
rather  than  curled  in  definite  form. 
Slight  wings  of  hair  at  the  forehead 
show  fashion's  compromise  between 
the  completely  exposed  forehead  and 
the  bang  vogue.  Feathery  wisps  at  the 
ears  also  suggest  the  popular  face 
curls.  A  long  bob,  at  least  four  inches 
of  back  hair,  is  necessary  for  this  ar- 
rangement. 

Fashion,  which  for  a  while  has  more 
or  less  frowned  upon  the  back  roll  in 
favor  of  the  revealed  hairline,  now 
admits  that  either  the  roll  must  come 
into  wide  popularity  again  or  the 
hats  with  upturned  backs  must  go.  The 
smooth,  unadorned  neckline  simply 
does  not  adjust  itself  becomingly  to 
this  more  romantic  line   in   hats.

form  a  shimmering  nimbus  for 
the  face.  The  side  hair  is  cut  and

downward.  Only  a  suggestion 
of  wave  breaks  the  sides.

Says  Chester  Morris,  whose  bitter  experi- 
ences in  Hollywood  are  a  warning  to  any 
youngster  with  an  eye  upon  movie  fame 


IF  a  clever  boy  or  girl,  with  looks,  charm  and  maybe  untrained 
talent,  came  to  me  and  asked,  "How's  chances  of  my  break- 
ing into  the  picture  game?"  I  wouldn't  waste  time  citing 
the  thousands  and  thousands  of  examples  of  those  who  have 
tried  and  failed,  in  pointing  to  the  long  list  of  disappointed 
extras  who  are  thankful  for  one  day's  work  a  week,  or  in 
reading  aloud  Hollywood  Chamber  of  Commerce  warnings. 

Instead,  I'd  take  that  boy  or  girl  right  over  to  Chester 
Morris'  house  and  let  him  or  her  listen  to  what  happened  to 
Chet,  a  lad  with  ten  years'  theatrical  experience  behind  him 
and  a  "pull"  with  a  big  Hollywood  director.  And  the  first 
thing  that  Chester  would  say,  I  feel  sure,  is,  "Don't  come  to 
Hollywood  expecting  help  from  a  friend." 

You  see,  I  remember  when  the  Morrises,  Chester,  his  father, 
mother,  brother  and  sister  were  on  a  vaudeville  tour,  together. 
They  landed  in  Los  Angeles  for  a  week's  performance,  on  their 
way  to  Portland,  the  last  stop  on  their  tour. 

One  evening,  the  whole  family  received  an  invitation  to  sup 
at  Cecil  B.  De  Mille's.  That  was  oh,  at  least  five  or  six  years 
ago  when  De  Mille  was  the  king  in  Hollywood. 

Mrs.  Morris  had  known  both  Cecil  and  brother  William  as 
boys,  had  practically  raised  William  during  their  early  days  on 
the  stage,  and  had  been  the  soul  of  kindness. 

Halfway  through  the  meal  Chester  became  conscious,  not 
that  Chester  had  been  previously  unconscious  you  know,  that 
the  appraising  eyes  of  Cecil  were  fastened  upon  him  with  an 
"I  wonder"  look. 

He  couldn't  swallow.  He  became  all  entangled  in  his  glass 
of  water  and  felt  sure  he  wasn't  crooking  his  little  finger  in  the 
proper  manner.     Chester  was  fussed. 

"Etta,"  De  Mille  said  to  Mrs.  Morris,  "I  am  going  to  steal 
jour  son.  I  am  going  to  place  him  in  pictures.  I  have  a  part 
coming  up  that  was  simply  made  for  him."  Chester  floated 
home,  his  head  in  the  clouds. 


SO  it  was  arranged  that  the 
Morrises  were  to  finish  their 
tour  in  Portland,  return  to 
Hollywood  and  drop  Chester 
off  for  his  movie  career. 

But  when  Chester  tore  out 
to  the  studios,  he  couldn't  get 
in. 

Nobody  knew  him.  Finally, 
after  days  of  trying,  he  did 
manage  to  get  to  De  Mille's 
secretary  who  relayed  the  mes- 
sage to  Cecil. 

"Oh — ah — yes,  yes,  it's 
Chester,"  the  director  said. 
"Well,  well,  it's  Chester. 
pell." 

So  a  pass  to  visit  the  sets  was 
written  out  and  given  Chester. 
Here  he  was  to  absorb  and 
learn. 

For  three  solid  months  a 
miserable  young  man  absorbed. 
And  there's  nothing  like  ab- 
sorbing in  Hollywood.  He  got 
in  the  way,  made  himself  a 
nuisance  and  wished  he  were 
dead  or  had  five  cents  extra  to 
buy  an  ice  cream  cone  or  some- 
thing. 


Here's  the  story  youVe 
been  waiting  for.  Read  it 
next  month  in  Photoplay 

WITH  the  September  issue,  PHOTOPLAY  brings 
you  a  treat  we  have  been  planning  for  some  time. 
It's  the  story  of  a  woman  who  has  endeared  her- 
self to  millions  of  fans  all  over  the  world — Marie  Dress- 
ier. She  has  lived  a  rich,  colorful  life — full  of  heart- 
aches, humor  and  triumphs,  and  her  philosophy  will  be 
more  helpful  to  you  than  most  sermons.  Equally  im- 
portant is  the  fact  that  it  will  be  written  by  Adela  Rogers 
St.  Johns,  whom  this  story  brings  back  to  PHOTOPLAY 


Funds  dwindled  while  an  entire  family  waited  for  the 
promise  of  an  old  friend  to  materialize.  The  other  Morrises  had 
hunted  picture  work,  too,  but,  pshaw!  if  you  couldn't  work 
with  De  Mille  behind  you  what  could  you  do  without  him? 

The  family  car  seemed  to  know  the  plight  of  the  Morrises 
and,  sympathizing  no  end,  ran  almost  of  its  own  accord.  No 
gas.    No  oil.    It  just  naturally  kept  going. 

Finally  the  family  grew  desperate  with  everything  going  out 
and  nothing  coming  in,  and  Chester  determined  he  would  do 
something  about  it.  Oh,  now  mind,  he'd  tried  to  bring  things 
to  a  head  before.  But  suave  promises  and  assurances  were 
always  given. 

Wait,  wait,  wait,  he  was  told.  And  starve  in  the  meantime, 
he  supposed. 

But  now  he  was  mad,  boiling  mad.  He  stormed  up  to  the 
secretary.  " Have  you  an  appointment?"  she  asked.  "Listen," 
old  man  Morris'  boy  Chester  shouted,  "  I  want  to  see  De  Mille." 
And  if  you've  seen  Chester  on  the  screen  you  know  he's  con- 
siderable of  a  stormer. 

WELL,  he  saw  Cecil.    The  director  was  up  on  a  ladder, 
directing  a   bathroom  scene,   and  he  looked    down    at 
Chester. 

"My  boy,  my  boy,"  he  choked.  Chester  hoped  he  would. 
"I  was  dreaming  of  Etta,  your  dear  mother,  last  night.  What 
a  sweet  friend  she  was  to  me  in  time  of  need.  How  kind.  Now, 
you  have  been  a  good  boy.  You've  been  patient.  And  I  am 
about  to  reward  you,  for  your  sweet  mother's  sake."  Who  was, 
Chet  remembered,  looking  pale  and  wan  that  morning  and 
almost  hungry. 

"You  come  to  me  at  9:45  tomorrow  morning,"  he  said,  "and 
get  your  first  part." 

And  the  old  car  kicked  up  its  hind  end,  turned  around  and 

made  a  bee-line  for  home. 

"Well,  De  Mille  wasn't 
such  a  bad  guy  after  all," 
Chester  decided.  "He  knew 
what  he  was  doing.  They  do 
keep  promises  in  Hollywood, 
after  all." 

The  next  morning  the  sun 
shone  bright  and  at  that,  it 
had  nothing  on  Chester's  face. 
Chet  positively  beamed. 

He  approached  the  secre- 
tary. "  Certainly  I  have  an  ap- 
pointment," he  grinned.  "I 
was  to  be  here  at  9:45.  And 
boy,  I'm  here." 

The   secretary   looked    puz- 
zled. "  When  did  Mr.  De  Mille 
tell  you  to  be  here?  "  she  asked. 
"Yesterday    morning,"     he 
smiled. 

For  a  long  minute  the  secre- 
tary looked  at  him.  Finally 
she  said,  "I — I'm  really  sorry. 
I  am  honestly.  You  see,  Mr. 
De  Mille  left  on  his  yacht  yes- 
terday afternoon  for  a  three- 
months'  cruise." 

Somehow  Chet  got  back 
home.  And  somehow  they  be- 
gan gathering  together  funds  to

Madge  Evans  demonstrates 
some  of  her  tricks  of  packing. 
First,  pack  the  shoes,  stuffing 
the  toe  with  tissue  paper  and 
placing  mates  toe  to  heel  in 
a  neat  layer.  Then  cover 
with  a  sheet  of  tissue  and  pack 
the    daintier  things   on    top 


Sleeves — ah,  there's  a  prob- 
lem, especially  in  these  days 
when  they  are  such  an  im- 
portant part  of  the  frock. 
Madge  stuffs  the  sleeve  with 
tissue  to  keep  it  from  annoy- 
ing   wrinkling    when    folded 


The  circular  skirt  of  the  dress 
is  smoothed  out  and  folded 
carefully  over  a  sheet  of  tis- 
sue. Madge  selects  a  table 
of  just  the  right  height  for  her 
work.  An  important  item, 
that,  because  you  can  wear

GONE  the  day  when  a  parade  of  bell  hops 
laden  with  suitcases,  hatboxes,  and  pedi- 
greed pooches  trailed  a  traveling  moving 
picture  actress.  Now,  we  find  by  sleuthing  in 
airports,  railroad  stations  and  at  the  docks  that 
these  ladies  travel  comfortably  with  a  few  well- 
chosen  pieces  of  luggage. 

Claudette  Colbert,  for  instance,  went  around 
the  world  with  a  couple  of  hand  trunks  and  an 
overnight  case  carrying  all  the  frocks  she 
needed. 

Lace  evening  frocks  she  recommends  to  the 
traveler.  They  don't  wrinkle,  you  know.  Two, 
one  in  a  light  color  and  one  dark,  saw  her 
through  evenings  all  over  the  world.  The  short 
evening  wrap  is  a  boon  to  the  traveler  for  it  can 
double  for  formal  afternoon  wear. 

Almost  all  the  room  in  one  hand  trunk  was 
taken  up  with  a  supply  of  Claudette's  favorite 
creams,  lotions,  perfumes  and  such,  for  she  says 
that  whatever  one's  wardrobe  may  suffer,  it  is 
easier  to  repair  than  any  damage  to  the  com- 
plexion. 

Lilyan  Tashman  has  a  case  in  which  she 
carries  nothing  but  her  creams,  soaps,  tooth- 
paste and  the  other  odds  and  ends  that  are 
likely  to  clutter  up  the  suitcase. 

She  is  a  very  methodical  packer,  with  her 
suitcase  full  of  labeled  cases  for  hose,  gloves, 
handkerchiefs,  and  everything  neatly  in  place 
so  that  anything  needed  may  be  taken  out 
without  rummaging  through  the  whole  bag. 

Lounging  pajamas  are  indispensable  to  the 
smart  traveler.  Nancy  Carroll  wears  them  in 
her  drawing-room  on  the  Pullman — very  sober 
ones  with  wide-skirted  trousers  that  are  not 
conspicuous  when  the  wearer  steps  off  the  train 
for  a  stroll.

a  tweed  coat  with  a  dark  frock  or  a  tweed  suit 
with  jersey  blouse.  Genevieve  has  no  patience 
with  travelers  who  have  to  have  everything 
pressed  the  minute  they  arrive  at  their  desti- 
nation. She  considers  time  given  to  careful 
packing  much  better  spent  than  time  wasted 
with  having  things  pressed  once  the  traveler  is 
on  her  way. 

A  tailored  suit  or  a  trim  travel  coat  is  the 
accepted  thing  for  boarding  or  leaving  the 
train,  of  course. 

•"THERE  is  so  much  motoring  about  Holly- 
*■  wood  that  no  star's  wardrobe  is  without 
several  soft,  roomy  topcoats.  The  newest  are 
severely  tailored,  very  broad-shouldered  and 
slim-waisted,  not  belted.  Since  Garbo  started 
it,  there  may  be  a  vogue  for  capes  for  motoring 
and  traveling.  So  far  she  is  one  of  the  few  who 
wear  them  and  she  had  several  like  the  one  she 
wears  in  her  latest  picture. 

Remember  Claudette  Colbert  spent  some 
time  in  the  Orient  on  the  famed  trip  she  and 
her  husband,  Norman  Foster,  took  on  a  happy- 
go-lucky  freighter.  She  had  a  number  of  cot- 
ton and  linen  frocks  with  her  for  the  hot  coun- 
tries— a  consideration  for  all  of  us  in  a  season 
when  cottons  are  so  smart.  They  take  up  little 
room,  can  be  laundered  in  a  few  hours  and  they 
are  always  so  much  fresher  looking  than  silks. 
A  good  idea  for  the  August  vacationist. 

For  one  so  young,  Madge  Evans  is  a  seasoned 
traveler,  with  several  trips  to  Europe  and  much 


cross-continent  commuting  to  her  credit.  She 
says  no  traveler  is  comfortable  without  at 
least  one  deep  piece  of  luggage  to  hold  such 
bulky  things  as  coats  and  robes. 

She  is  another  who  considers  careful  packing 
the  best  way  to  insure  a  comfortable  and  happy 
journey.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  she  does  the  job 
so  well  that  it  is  always  given  her.  So,  when- 
ever the  Evanses  go  jaunting,  their  well- 
groomed  appearance  is  due  to  little  Madge. 

At  a  moment's  notice  Joan  Crawford  could 
have  trunk  and  hand  luggage  packed  for  a  trip 
to  Europe.  In  the  first  place,  she  is  so  method- 
ical and  neat  and  efficient  about  her  wardrobe 
that  she  knows  where  everything  is.  Evert 
garment  is  in  perfect  repair  or  it  doesn't  gel 
put  away.  And  there  is  one  secret  of  that 
Crawford  girl's  chic  and  smartness. 

A  loose  button  on  a  jacket,  the  tiniest  rip  of 
a  seam,  a  loose  clasp  on  a  bracelet,  a  spot  on  a 
scarf — these  small  matters  are  not  brooked  in 
the  Crawford  wardrobe.  So  Joan  can  step  out 
any  time  in  a  trim,  smart  ensemble,  sure  of  the 
freshness  and  sleekness  of  her  costume. 

When  it  comes  to  packing,  Joan  sees  to  that 
herself.  No  maid  can  quite  achieve  the  Craw- 
ford deftness.  The  bag  is  packed  with  care  and 
thought  for  the  destination.  When  Joan  goes 
traveling  she  considers  the  costume  and  ensem- 
bles she  will  need  and  everything  is  packed  ac- 
cordingly. If  she  arrives  in  time  to  be  a  spec- 
tator at  some  sports  event,  the  appropriate 
frock  or  suit  is  packed  last  with  its  accessories 
all  at  hand.  The  dinner  frock  is  next  to  the 
last,  as  the  second  to  be  needed,  and  so  on 
through  the  days  and  evenings.  Xo  time 
wasted  looking  for  an  odd  stocking  or  a 
wandering  handbag.  They  are  neatly  and 
obediently  in  place.

Home  Beautq  Treatment 


Young  Mrs.  Carnegie  isblessed 
with  that  exquisitely  clear 
pale  skin  usually  possessed  by 
only  the  Parisienne. 

'^hat  do  I  do  for  it- 
why  that's  very  simple,"  says 
Mrs.  Carnegie.  "I  have  found 
the  perfect  way  to  keep  my 
skin  lovely  at  home. 

"What  I  do  is — but  wouldn't 
you  actually  like  toseemedo  it? 

"First,  thorough  cleansing 
— I  always  have  a  big  jar  of 
Pond's  Cold  Cream.  There's 
nothing  like  it  for  cleansing. 
The  cream  melts  almost  in- 
stantly— I  wait  a  few  minutes 
to  let  the  fine  oils  float  every 
speck  of  dust  and  dirt  out  of 
the  pores.  Then  I  wipe  it  all 
away  with  Pond's  Cleansing 
Tissues — I  like  them  best  be- 
cause they're  so  much  softer 
and  more  absorbent. 

"Now  my  skin  is  absolutely 
clean  and  ready  for  the  second 
step — stimulating.  You  have 
to  stimulate  the  skin  if  you 


want  it  to  stay  young  looking. 
Wet  a  pad  of  cotton  with 
Pond's  Skin  Freshener,  and 
pat,  pat,  pat  like  this  till  the 
skin  glows. 

"The  next  step  is  to  protect 
the  skin — to  keep  it  smooth 
and  fine.  Smoothing  on  Pond's 
Vanishing  Cream  takes  just  a 
second.  I'm  devoted  to  it  be- 
cause it  doesn't  dry  the  skin. 
Pond's  Vanishing  Cream  is  a 
marvelous  powder  foundation. 

"Isn't  that  a  simple  home 
treatment?  And  it  works.  I 
do  it  every  day  and  always 
after  exposure. 

"At  bedtime,  after  cleans- 
ing with  Cold  Cream  and 
Tissues  I  always  put  on  a  bit 
more  of  the  rich  Cold  Cream 
and  leave  it  on  overnight  to 
lubricate  my  skin.  You  know, 
,  scientifically,  the  skin  does 
need  just  four  things  to  keep 
it  lovely — cleansing,  lubricat- 
ing, stimulating  and  protect- 
ing. And  my  Pond's  method 
supplies  every  one  of  these."

THE  other  day  a  Hollywood  woman  said, 
"June  Clyde  has  something  rather  pa- 
thetic in  her  face,  and  the  minx  probably 
never  had  a  worry  in  her  life." 

No?    Well,  listen  to  June's  story. 

She's  twenty-one  years  old,  and  into  those 
twenty-one  years  are  crowded  numerous  joys, 
sorrows,  two  careers  and  one  or  two  or  even 
three  good-sized  heartbreaks. 

When  June  was  eight,  Oscar  Walsh,  a  Metro- 
politan Opera  singer,  came  to  her  home  in  San 
Francisco  to  call.  A  jumping  jack  of  a  tow- 
headed,  brown-eyed  little  imp  listened  to  the 
great  singer  and  insisted  that  she  sing,  too. 

Indulgently,  they  let  her  sing  and  for  no  rea- 
son at  all  the  song  was  "  When  It's  Peach  Pick- 
ing Time  in  Georgia."  She  stood  there,  a  thin, 
wiry  little  thing  and  from  her  throat  poured  a 
mass  of  golden  notes  that  completely  filled  the 
little  room.  And  as  the  song  came  to  an  end,  one 
person  at  least  knew  what  lay  ahead  for  June 
Clyde.    That  person  was  Oscar  Walsh. 

He  took  her  under  his  wing.  Each  day  he 
came  to  the  house  to  give  June  her  singing 
lessons. 

At  the  time,  an  operetta  called  "Under- 
ground Chinatown "  was  being  rehearsed  in 
San  Francisco  with  Mr.  Walsh  as  its  musical 
director.  The  cast  was  composed  entirely  of 
adults  but  a  bit  in  the  second  act  was  injected 
for  little  June.  In  this,  she  was  to  make  her 
debut. 

"Now  don't  be  nervous,"  they  cautioned 
while  June  looked  at  them  in  wonder.  Just 
why,  she  reasoned,  when  she  was  about  to  do 
the  thing  she  wanted  to  do  above  all  else, 
should  she  be  nervous? 

"Don't  be  frightened.  Don't  be  frightened," 
they  cautioned  her  over  and  over. 

Her  mother  stood  wide-eyed  and  speechless 
in  the  wings.  Her  father's  face  in  the  audience 
stood  out  like  a  white  blur  in  a  sea  of  darkness. 

Dressed  in  her  little  Chinese  pajamas,  wav- 
ing her  fan,  rolling  her  eyes  of  milk  chocolate 
brown,  pulled  onto  the  stage  in  a  gaily  deco- 
rated rickshaw,  came  June. 

"Hong,  He  Came  From  Hong  Kong,"  she 
sang  as  back  and  forth  the  little  fan  waved. 
The  eyes  flirted  outrageously.  Tiny,  she  was, 
like  a  Chinese  doll.  And  as  that  voice  rolled 
out  through  the  theater,  people  sat  forward  in 
their  seats,  amazed. 

"Were  we  fooled  by  a  little  eight-year-old 
girl?"  one  San  Francisco  paper  demanded. 
"Could  it  be  possible  for  so  tiny  a  mite  to 
possess  a  voice  like  that,  or  did  someone  else 
do  that  singing?" 

"Little  Missouri"  they  billed  her  as  she 
went  up  and  down  the  coast,  filling  the  theaters 
that  clamored  for  her.  June  was  born  in  the 
show-me  state. 

"She'll  be  the  greatest  singer  of  all  time," 
everyone  assured.  "The  greatest,  with  that 
voice." 

"Don't  let  her  sing  too  much  now,"  the 
teacher  cautioned.  "At  twelve  she  must  ease 
down,  for  several  years."  But  the  crowds 'de- 
manded. And  nothing  could  stop  little  June 
from  singing. 

TDUT  a  day  came  when  June  felt  the  power 
•'-'within  her  receding.  The  notes  weren  't  as 
full,  or  as  golden. 

And  then,  when  she  needed  him  most,  Oscar 
Walsh  died.  Bravely,  but  a  bit  fearful,  June 
carried  on,  until  finally  she  gave  in.  Her  voice 
did  need  a  rest.    So  the  blazing  lights  and  the

The  amazing  story 
of  June  Clyde  who 
was  a  concert  singer 
when  she  was  eight 

By   F  r  a n c e s 
Denton 


Whenever  "Little  Missouri" 
came  to  town,  the  auditorium 
was  packed.  Her  voice  had 
the  beauty,  the  richness  and 
the  power  of  an  adult  singer's 


June  Clyde  today,  a  radiant, 
happy  girl  of  twenty-one. 
Only  a  few  people  know  the 
heartaches  she  suffered  when 
she  had  to  give  up  her  career 


thrills  of  the  theater  behind  her,  June  went  off 
to  the  Tobin  School  in  San  Francisco. 

The  school  planned  a  theatrical  and  June 
was  in  her  glory.  She  designed  the  costumes 
and  the  backgrounds.  Growing  bolder,  she 
even  decided  to  sing.  She  chose  "Remember- 
ing" from  "Topsy  and  Eva."  She  could 
scarcely  wait  for  the  joy  of  singing  again  before 
people. 

The  excitement  buoyed  her  up.  The  night 
came.  The  auditorium  was  packed  with  her 
friends.  She  opened  her  lips  and  only  a  thin, 
reedy  sound  came  to  her  ears.  Her  voice  was 
off  key  but  she  couldn't  stop.  Suddenly  there 
was  laughter  from  schoolmates. 

She  vaguely  remembers  boarding  a  street 
car  and  riding  for  hours,  too  numb  to  move. 

June  didn't  go  back  to  Tobin  School.  She 
finished  her  year  at  a  public  high  school.  Out 
of  her  failure,  June  built  a  vow.  She  would  go 
on,  anyhow.  The  theater  was  where  she  be- 
longed, and  some  day  she  would  go  back  to  it, 
even  without  the  voice. 

She  had  just  entered  the  University  of  Cali- 
fornia when  her  chance  came  with  a  small 
stock  company  playing  one  night  stands  in 
Southern  California.    She  grabbed  it. 

Fanchon  and  Marcho,  creator  of  prologue 
ideas  sent  for  her  next.  She  had  learned  to 
dance,  to  pick  up  the  fragments  of  her  broken 
voice  and  even  sing  a  little.  And,  more  im- 
portant, she  learned  to  act. 

In  Seattle,  it  was,  that  a  wire  reached  her. 
"Come  to  Paramount  Studios,"  it  read.  "We 
want  you  for  a  picture." 

June  did  her  first  picture,  "Why  Bring  That 
Up."  Then  she  went  to  Radio  Pictures  and  a 
contract.  But  even  then  musicals  were  on  the 
wane. 

They  saw  in  June,  not  a  splendid  little 
actress,  but  only  a  mediocre  singer  and  fair 
dancer.    They  didn't  renew  her  contract. 

DESPAIR  seized  her  again.  Long  ago  she 
had  heard  her  mother  choose  between  her 
father  and  her.  "June  leaves  the  stage  or  I 
go,"  her  father  had  said.  And  her  mother, 
knowing  what  was  in  June's  heart,  had  chosen 
June. 

So  the  responsibility  of  providing  for  this 
mother  who  had  stood  shoulder  to  shoulder 
with  her  throughout  the  years,  fell  upon  June 
alone.  The  time  came  again  when  June  Clyde, 
scarcely  out  of  her  teens,  stood  on  the  threshold 
of  finding  another  career. 

And  just  at  that  point  came  a  test  for 
"Whoopee."  Thornton  Freeland  was  the  di- 
rector. He  looked  at  June  and  understood  a 
little  how  things  were  with  her.  The  test 
wasn't  successful.  But  it  meant  the  turning 
point  in  June's  life. 

A  rest  followed  in  a  sanitarium  and  a  little 
later  June  and  Thornton  were  married. 

Out  at  Universal,  June  has  just  signed  a  new 
contract.  Life  for  her  has  suddenly  seemed  to 
flower  and  bloom  again.  She  recently  finished 
"Cohens  and  Kellys  in  Hollywood,"  "Radio 
Patrol"  and  "Back  Street. " 

About  her  there  is  a  sparkle,  a  spontaneity, 
that  is  catching.  As  if  all  the  tragic  years  be- 
tween the  debut  of  that  little  eight-year-old 
June  with  her  fan,  and  the  present  June,  were 
all  erased. 

There  is  a  lot  behind  her.  And  there  is  a  lot 
ahead.  But  into  her  eyes  at  times  comes  a  look 
that  seems  to  speak  of  things  that  can't  ever 
be  forgotten.

parents  and  guardians 
in  a  spirit  of  con- 
structive helpfulness. 


THIS  year — some  five 
million  young  girls  be- 
tween the  ages  of  10  and  14 
will  face  one  of  the  most  try- 
ing situations  in  all  the  years 
of  young  womanhood. 

This  year — some  five  mil- 
lion mothers  will  face  the 
most  difficult  task  of  mother- 
hood. 

Thousands  of  these  moth- 
ers will  sit  down  in  quiet 
rooms  —  and  from  that  in- 
timacy so  characteristic  of 
today's  mother  and  daughter 
— there  will  result  that  un- 
derstanding so  vital  to  the 
daughter  of  today — the  wife 
and  mother  of  tomorrow. 

There  will  be  other  thou- 
sands of  mothers — coura- 
geous— intimate  in  all  things 
but  this. There  will  be  thou- 
sands too  timid  to  meet  this 
problem — and  it  will  pass — 
but  with  what  possible  un- 
happiness  .  .  .  what  heart- 
breaking experience. 

To  free  this  task  of  en- 
lightenment from  the  slight- 
est embarrassment  —  the 
Kotex  Company  has  had 
prepared  an  intimate  little 
chat  between  mother  and

Consider   Your    Brow    Line    Carefu 

By  Carolyn  Van  Wyck 


y 


HALF  of  the  beauty  of  Tallulah  Bankhead's  searching 
eyes,  at  top,  are  her  brows  which  arch  decidedly 
yet  which  mark  perfectly  that  unusually  full  space  be- 
tween bone  and  eye  socket.  Below,  Anita  Page's 
faintly  arched  brows  contrast  most  favorably  with  the 
old  straight  line  seen  at  the  right.  With  the  arch  Anita 
looks  sweeter,  more  likable. 


THE  influence  of  that  platinum  wig  Greta 
Garbo  wears  in  "As  You  Desire  Me" 
doubtless  will  leave  its  mark.  Already 
some  of  the  Hollywood  coiffures  have  been 
inspired  by  it,  I  think.  With  a  few  reserva- 
tions and  a  few  modifications  it  is  rather  a 
grand  style  for  the  girl  who  likes  a  trim  shingle 
with  a  careless  forelock. 

rymOTHY  MACKAILL  is  a  true  blonde. 
-*—  One  look  at  that  light,  sun-bleached 
outdoor  head  and  you  are  convinced  that  she 
does  not  know  even  a  lemon  rinse.  It  is  nice 
hair  for  her  pleasant,  comradely  personality. 
A  striking  feature  of  her  face  are  those  wide- 
apart  eyebrows,  slanting  almost  straight  down- 
ward, a  style  I  often  decry.  But  with  Dorothy 
they  are  right.  Lon  Chaney  designed  them  for 
her  in  1923,  she  told  me.  One  day  he  looked  at 
her,  decided  her  brows  were  wrong,  took  a 
pencil,  drew  the  two  lines  to  which  she  has 
clung  ever  since. 

Wide-apart  brows  do  something  for  the  face, 
if  by  nature  you  have  that  kind  of  disposition — 
a  frank,  sincere  one.  They  also  add  a  pleasant 
sense  of  innocence  and  wonderment  to  the  very 
young  face.  Rochelle  Hudson's  baby  sweetness 
of  expression  comes  largely  from  her  brows. 
Loretta  Young  has  the  same  kind. 

AND  speaking  of  brows,  Fifi  Dorsay  illus- 
L  trated  a  point  with  her  own  which  is  very 
true.  Narrow  brows  make  the  eyes  appear 
larger.  Heavy  brows  detract  from  the  size  of 
the  eyes  and  should  be  permitted  only  when 
the  eyes  are  quite  large  and  lovely.  A  nice 
make-up  trick  is  to  allow  the  brows  to  remain 
fairly  light — if  you  have  that  coloring — and 
to  use  a  little  mascara  and  eye  shadow  to 
darken  the  eyes  themselves.  In  this  treatment 
the  eyes  receive  the  emphasis  of  attention. 

T  ELYAN  TASHMAN  certainly  has  a  lew 
-*— '  beauty  tricks  up  her  sleeve  and  some  to 
spare.  Miss  Tashman  has  decided  to  remain 
unbumed  this  summer — from  the  waist  up, 
that  is.  For  heath  she  has  decided  to  don  a 
long-sleeved  sweater,  a  scarf  a  very  large  hat, 
and  gloves,  and  from   the   waist   down   wear 

86 


only  shorts,  so  that  her  legs  may  tan.  She  will 
not  mind  the  tan  legs  because  they  will  burn 
in  smart  stocking  tones  and  not  interfere  with 
them  in  the  least.  "I  will  go  around  the  beach 
looking  for  shade  and  cool  places.  Of  course 
there  won't  be  any  and  everyone  will  hate  me 
for  being  a  big  nuisance,  "  rhe  laughed. 

Another  Tashman  trick,  startling  in  its  sim- 
plicity, is  Miss  Tashman's  consumption  of 
water.  "At  least  a  gallon  a  day,"  she  admits. 
A  gallon  is  certainly  self-discipline,  but  the 
requisite  eight  glasses  are  not  so  bad.  For  seme 
reason  women  do  not  drink  nearly  so  much 
water  as  men,  and  it  is  too  bad,  for  it  is  a 
great  skin  beauty  aid.  Begin,  if  possible,  be- 
fore breakfast  with  a  big  tumbler  and  half  a 
lemon  or  a  fillip  of  salt.  It  isn't  so  bad,  after  all ! 

SYLYIA  SIDNEY  is  another  cne  of  those 
girls  who  shampoos  her  own  head — and 
every  week  at  that.  The  head  seems  the  most 
difficult  part  of  the  human  body  to  work  on, 
oneself.  My  hat  off  to  Sylvia.  She  uses  a 
castile  liquid  shampoo,  or,  that  missing,  will 


Many  of  us  will  return  from  va-

not  enough  care.  Our  skin  leaf- 
let and  reducing  booklet  may

make  her  own  from  castile  soap.  She  does  not 
find  the  weekly  shampoo  too  drying,  nor  does 
any  young  head,  I  think. 

It  is  said  that  among  the  secrets  of  Jean 
Harlow's  platinum  aura  is  that  every -other- 
day  shampoo.  That  seems  too  much  of  a  good 
thing. 

Sylvia  also  okays  my  favorite  resting  stunt — 
lying  flat  on  the  floor,  arms  outstretched,  for 
ten  or  fifteen  minutes.  It  sounds  awful,  but 
try  it,  and  you'll  find  you  simply  have  to 
relax  and  be  another  person. 

T  ALMOST  forgot  the  big  secret  abcut  Fifi 
■*■  Dorsay.  Her  hair  is  not  black  at  all.  It  is 
a  reddish,  tawny  color,  believe  it  or  not.  Fifi 
invited  me  to  look  at  the  roots,  and  there  it 
was,  along  with  her  light  gray  eyes  and  the 
fair,  delicate  skin  that  goes  with  that  type. 
Why  does  she  do  it,  you  will  ask.  Fifi  thinks 
the  American  audiences  would  expect  a  little 
French  girl  to  have  shiny  black  hair,  so  she 
obligingly  has  it  dyed,  then  pours  quarts  of  an 
oily  hair  tonic  over  it  to  make  it  shine.  There 
are  plenty  of  blondes  that  have  strayed  from 
the  intentions  of  nature,  so  far  as  their  hair  is 
concerned,  but  there  are  precious  few  blondes 
who  go  black. 

TOAN  CRAWFORD'S  mouth  in  "Letty 
J  Lynton"  caused  a  cloud  of  comment.  In 
the  New  York  theater,  at  luncheon,  indeed 
wherever  there  were  girls  who  had  seen  the 
picture  you  were  sure  to  hear,  "Did  you  like 
Joan  Crawford's  mouth?"  I  don't  think  any 
did,  yet  I  think  it  fascinated  some  people.  It 
was  so  advanced  it  hardly  resembled  a  mouth 
at  all.  yet  it  added  great  dramatic  value  to  her 
role.  Good  make-up  slant,  but  this  extreme 
exaggeration  should  be  reserved  for  screen  or. 
stage.  It  is  too  much  to  expect  our  friends,  our 
family  or  office  to  accept  any  startling  ex- 
treme day  by  day. 

PARAMOUNT  has  promised  the  most  luxuri- 
ous and  ornate  bathroom  of  modern  times 
in  the  forthcoming  "  Sign  of  the  Cross,"  a  replica 
of  the  bath  used  by  Poppaea,  wife  of  Nero, 
with   marble    steps,    fountains,  hand-maidens.

"One  Hour  With 
You"  was  another 
triumph  for  Jean- 
ette  MacDonald. 
But  it  brought 
Genevieve  Tobin 
out  in  a  new  type  of 
role.  Proving  her- 
self a  deft  comedi- 
enne,  she  and 
Jeanette  ran  a  very 
close  race  for  the 
feminine    honors 


THERE  are  a  lot  of  arguments  this  month 
about  whether  Jeanette  MacDonald  or 
Genevieve  Tobin  bad  the  main  lead  in 
"One  Hour  With  You."  Well,  I'll  be  the 
referee.  Jeanette  was  Chevalier's  leading  lady 
but  Genevieve  certainly  gave  her  a  good  chase 
for  first  place  and  almost  stole  the  picture  from 
her. 

And  now,  to  satisfy  hundreds  of  questioners, 
here  is  a  short  sketch  of  each  girl's  history: 

Jeanette  was  born  in  Philadelphia,  Penna., 
on  June  18,  1907.  She  is  5  feet,  5  inches  tall, 
weighs  125  pounds  and  has  red-gold  hair  and 
green  eyes.  She  was  a  favorite  in  musical 
comedy,  appearing  in  "Irene,"  "Tip  Toes," 
"Yes,  Yes,  Yvette,"  and  "Sunny  Days."  She 
got  her  first  break  in  pictures  in  August.  1929, 
when  she  was  given  the  lead  opposite  Chevalier 
in  "The  Love  Parade."  Among  the  pictures 
that  followed  were,  "Her  Wedding  Night," 
"The  Lottery  Bride,"  "Oh,  for  a  Man." 
"Monte  Carlo,"  and  "The  Affairs  of  Anna- 
belle."  Her  next  will  be  "Love  Me  Tonight," 
in  which  she  again  appears  opposite  Chevah'er. 

Genevieve  is  a  native  of  New  York  where  she 
was  born  on  November  29,  1904.  She  is  5  feet, 
3  inches  tall,  weighs  109  pounds  and  has  blonde 
hair  and  gray  eves.  Appeared  on  the  stage  in 
"The  Trial  of  Mary  Dugan,"  "Fifty  Million 
Frenchmen,"  "Little  Old  New  York,"  and 
"  Murray  Hill."  She  made  several  silent 
pictures  way  back  in  1924,  then  deserted 
pictures  for  the  stage  and  returned  to  the 
screen  in  1930  in  "A  Lady  Surrenders."  Since 
then  she  has  appeared  in  "Seed,"  "Up  for 
Murder,"  "The  Gay  Diplomat,"  and  others. 
Her  next  will  be  "Hollywood  Speaks,"  with 
Pat  O'Brien. 

Both  Jeanette  and  Genevieve  are  still  single, 
but  Jeanette  is  engaged  to  Rob  Ritchie,  who  is 
her  manager. 

Sally,  Grand  Rapids,  Mich. — Paul  Muni 
was  born  in  Yienna  on  September  11,  1897.  He 
came  to  America  with  his  parents  when  he  was 
four  years  old.  At  the  age  of  eleven  he  made 
his  foreign  stage  debut  playing  a  sixty-year-old 
man.    Made  his  New  York  stage  debut  in  "  We 

88 


Americans."  His  performance  placed  his  name 
up  among  the  popular  actors  in  the  theater.  In 
1929,  Winfield  Sheehan  gave  him  a  contract  to 
appear  in  Fox  pictures.  His  first  was  "'The 
Valiant,"  which  was  followed  by  "Seven 
Faces."  Howard  Hughes  gave  him  his  next 
break,  assigning  him  to  the  lead  in  "Scarface." 
After  "Scarface"  was  completed,  Paul  re- 
turned to  the  stage  in  "Counsellor-at-Law." 
With  the  release  of  "Scarface"  he  was  immedi- 
ately put  under  contract  by  Warners  and 
returned  to  Hollywood.  Paul  is  5  feet,  9  inches 
tall,  weighs  165  and  has  brown  hair  and  brown 
eyes.  Has  been  married  to  Belle  Fink  since 
May.  1921.  His  real  name  is  Muni  Weisen- 
freund,  but  he  changed  it  when  be  entered 
pictures. 

June  Bertox,  Chicago,  III. — Sidney  Fox 
is  just  about  5  feet  tall.  Boris  Karlotf  was  born 
on  November  23,  1887.  Jimmie  Dunn's  latest 
picture  is  titled  "Society  Girl." 

Cadet  Falxett,  Wayne,  Penna. — Here's 
the  low-down  on  that  little  girl  you  admire. 
Madge  Evans  was  born  in  New  York  City  on 
August  1,  1907.  She  is  5  feet,  4  inches  tall, 
weighs  116  and  has  golden  hair  and  blue  eyes. 
Didn't  you  like  her  on  the  June  cover  of 
Photoplay?     Madge  received  her  education

nected with  the  stage  and  screen  since  child- 
hood. Her  latest  picture  is  "Huddle,"  opposite 
Ramon  Novarro. 

Hadley  Odholm,  Denver,  Colo. — Don't 
ask  me  why  the  girls  pluck  and  paint  their  eye- 
brows. But  it  looks  swell  on  some  types  of 
girls.  Ruth  Chatterton  was  busy  all  spring 
producing  a  play  called  "Let  Us  Divorce." 
Her  husband,  Ralph  Forbes,  and  Rose  Hobart 
had  the  leads,  but  the  play  just  didn't  make  the 
grade.  Ruth's  next  appearance  in  pictures  will 
be  in  "Children  of  Pleasure." 

Margaret  E.  Ward,  Augusta,  Ga. — 
Johnny  Weissmuller  is  about  28  years  old.  He 
is  married  to  Bobbe  Arnst,  musical  comedy 
dancer.  Johnny  received  a  long-term  contract 
from  Metro  right  after  the  release  of  "Tarzan." 
You'll  be  seeing  him  on  the  screen  soon  again.

L.  B.  C,  Cape  Girardeau,  Mo. — Clara 
Bow  was  born  in  Brooklyn,  N.  Y.,  and  at- 
tended Public  School  No.  9  there.  She  never 
attended  school  in  any  part  of  Missouri. 

Charlotte  Theel,  Baltimore,  Md. — 
Here  are  the  girls  who  are  5  feet,  6  inches  in 
height:  Garbo,  Yilma  Banky,  Eleanor  Board- 
man,  Marguerite  Churchill  and  Doris  Kenyon.

grand  actors  and  great  favorites. 

Freda  Becker,  Philadelphia,  Penna. — 
Helen  Hayes  is  a  native  of  Washington,  D.  C, 
where  she  was  born  October  10,  1901.  She  is 
the  daughter  of  Francis  Brown  and  Catherine 
Hayes.  Is  5  feet,  1  inch  tall;  weighs  100 
pounds.  Has  light  brown  hair  and  blue  eyes. 
Was  educated  in  the  Sacred  Heart  Convent  in 
Washington.  On  the  stage  she  appeared  in 
"Coquette,"  "What  Every  Woman  Knows," 
"Dancing  Mothers,"  and  many  other  plays. 
She  entered  pictures  in  1931  appearing  in  "The 
Sin  of  Madelon  Claudet."  This  was  followed 
by  "Arrowsmith."  She  was  married  to  Charles 
MacArthur  on  August  17,  1928.  They  have 
one  small  daughter.  Photoplay  printed  a 
story  about  Helen  in  January  of  this  year. 

A  Tracy  Fan,  Buffalo,  N.  Y. — And  for  all 
the  other  Spencer  Tracy  fans,  here's  the  low-  I 
down  on  the  lad.  Spencer  was  born  in  Mil-  ! 
wauk.ee,  Wis.,  on  April  5,  1900.  He  is  5  feet, 
10^2  inches  tall;  weighs  165  and  has  dark  brown 
hair  and  blue  eyes.  Was  educated  in  public 
schools  of  Milwaukee  and  Marquette  Uni- 
versity. Also  attended  the  American  Academy 
of  Dramatic  Art.  Had  considerable  stage  ex- 
perience before  entering  pictures  in  1930. 
Among  the  pictures  he  made  since  that  time 
are,  "Up  the  River,"  "Quick  Millions,"  "Sky 
Devils,"  "Disorderly  Conduct,"  and  "Young 
America."  Spencer  is  married  to  Louise 
Treadwell  and  they  have  one  son.  Junior  is 
seven  years  old  and  a  carbon  copy  of  his 
popular  daddy.  Spencer's  hobby  is  bowling. 
He  also  likes  golf.  Favorite  pastimes  are  fish- 
ing, hunting  and  swimming.  His  latest  picture

If  you  don't  say  that  this  is  just  about

May  McAvoy  will  be  pretty  doggone 
mad  at  you.  "We've  named  him 
Patrick  Garrett  Cleary,"  said  mama 
May.  "That  makes  him  a  real  Irish- 
man, doesn't  it?"  Domesticity  has 
kept  May  off  the  screen  for  a  long

blossom  complexion  and  a  rather  high  pitched  voice.     Tut, 
tut,  Klissa,  it  simply  won't  do. 

At  the  moment  M-G-M  is  concentrating  upon  Jean  Harlow. 
Funny  thing  about  Jean.  She  made  her  screen  debut  as  the 
old-fashioned  vampire  of  the  Theda  Bara  tradition  in  "Hell's 
Angels."  Hut  she's  being  made  over  now,  into  the  modern 
version — hair  pushed  back  (it's  red  now  instead  of  platinum — 
see  page  69),  eyebrows  a  mere 
wispy  line  and  eyes  half  hidden 
beneath  put-'em-on-with-glue 
lashes. 

EVEN  Norma  Shearer  at- 
tempted glamour  in  "The 
Divorcee,"  "Strangers  May 
Kiss,"  "A  Free  Soul"  and  others. 
She  went  after  it  with  such  vigor 
that  even  Adrian,  the  head 
gown  designer  at  M-G-M,  de- 
murred at  her  suggestions  for 
clothes. 

Norma  bought  that  revealing 
costume  that  brought  amazed 
gasps  from  the  audience  when  she 
appeared  in  it  in  "A  Free  Soul." 

And  then  Norma  did  a  right- 
about-face. The  public  was 
annoyed  with  her  for  substitut- 
ing glamour  for  romance.  Let- 
ters poured  in  to  her  begging, 
"Please,  Norma,  stick  to 
romance." 

The  public  had  enough  shady 
dames  without  little  Mrs.  Thal- 
berg. 

Several  mothers,  who  always 
allowed  their  children  to  see 
Norma  Shearer's  films,  wrote  to 
her  begging  her  to  return  to 
straight  dramatic  roles  and  good 
clean  pictures  that  children 
could  see. 

Norma  is  a  smart  girl.  Having 
finished  "Strange  Interlude," 
she's  rushing  into  "Smilin' 
Through,"  as  sweet  a  little  story 
as  you'll  see. 

Maybe  you  remember  when 
Jane  Cowl  played  it  on  the 
stage  and  Norma  Talmadge  did 
it  in  pictures. 

"Possessed"  began  Joan  Crawford's  glamour  cycle.  "Letty 
Lynton"  carried  through.  In  that  picture  Joan  did  as  good 
a  piece  of  dramatic  acting  as  she  has  ever  done,  and  all  her 
admirers  knew  it,  but  even  so,  hundreds  of  them  wrote  to 
Photoplay  to  protest  about  her  screen  morals  and  to  beg 
her  to  return  to  the  gay  type  of  "Our  Dancing  Daughters" 
film  in  which  she  became  famous. 

Strangely  enough,  although  Garbo  started  the  vogue 
by  packing  them  into  the  theaters,  the  public  was  grateful 
to  her  for  those  scenes  in  "As  You  Desire  Me"  when  she  was  a 
sweet,  charming,  young  girl.  And  they  expressed  the  wish 
that  she  would  play  such  scenes  again  in  other  films. 

THE  public  will  not  allow  Janet  Gay  nor  to  follow  the  new 
vogue.  Poor  Janet — she's  more  than  anxious  to  try  her  hand 
at  something  a  trifle  daring,  yet  when  it  was  announced  she 
had  cut  her  long  bob  short,  dyed  her  hair  redder  and  insisted 
upon  being  sophisticated,  hundreds  of  letters  begged  her  to  let 
her  curls  grow  back  and  remain  just  sweet.  Incidentally,  one 
of  the  gallery  pictures  in  this  month's  magazine  is  of  Janet 
with  her  hair  done  in  the  fashion  you'll  never  see  on  the  screen 
— the  way  she  wants  it  but  the  way  the  public  doesn't.  She 
is  now  letting  her  hair  grow  again.

This  caricature  of  Garbo,  by  Joe  Grant,  empha- 
sizes the  facial  characteristics  of  the  star — the 
heavy  lips,  half-closed  eyes,  high  forehead  and 
snaky  eyebrows,  which  have  apparently  been  taken 
as  a  model  for  the  new  school  of  shady  dames 


This  change  in  the  women  stars  has  brought  about  a  change 
in  the  men.  The  pretty  boys,  the  matinee  idols,  the  gallant, 
protecting  heroes  have  been  replaced  by  the  Clark  Gables, 
James  Cagneys,  George  Rafts  and  Johnny   Weissmullers. 

Each  studio  is  hunting  for  second  Clark  Gables — men  who 

knock  women  down,  kick  'em   around  and  make  'em  like  it. 

The  shady  dame  has  become  the  heroine  instead  of  the  vamp; 

the  rough  guy  is  the  hero,  in- 
stead of  the  villain.  A  few  years 
ago  had  Johnny  Weissmuller 
presented  himself  to  any  self- 
respecting  casting  director,  he 
would  have  been  listed  im- 
mediately as  a  heavy — one  of 
those  big,  strong  guys  whom  the 
handsome  hero  could  overcome 
single-handed.  But  not  now — 
no  sir,  Johnny  was  cast  as  the 
hero  in  "Tarzan,  the  Ape  Man." 
Even  that  big,  burly  Wallace 
Beery  is  a  hero  in  many  pictures. 
And  as  the  style  in  heroes  and 
heroines  has  changed,  so  have 
movie  plots.  Marriage  is  not  a 
necessity  on  the  screen  these 
days  and,  in  spite  of  the  cen- 
sors, illicit  love  is  sometimes 
glorified. 

THE  wave  has  swept  even  far- 
ther. Second  leads,  juveniles, 
ingenues  have  all  been  touched 
by  the  new  vogue,  for  on  the 
screen  the  sweet  young  girl  is 
left  in  the  lurch  while  the  shady 
dame  walks  off  with  her  man. 
So  Hollywood  girls,  trying  to  get 
a  break  in  pictures,  have  real- 
ized that  in  glamour  lies  their 
fortune. 

At  a  recent  Hollywood  lunch- 
eon I  noticed  a  number  of  the 
newer  players,  girls  like  Frances 
Dean,  who  is  making  her  first 
picture  for  Educational.     With 
very  few  exceptions,  these  young 
girls  had  rouged  their  mouths 
until  they  looked  like  nothing  so 
much  as  members  of  a  minstrel 
show  just  about  to  ask  Mr. 
Bones  a  leading  question. 
Now  remember,  make-up  cleverly  and  subtly  applied  is  nec- 
essary to  the  charm  of  every  woman.      I'm   only  speaking  cf 
the  exaggerations. 

Even  Colleen  Moore  has  gone  glamorous,  with  a  new  hair 
style,  new  make-up  and  false  eyelashes. 

As  a  novelty,  this  new  sex  is  interesting.  Garbo  was  and  is 
fascinating. 

BUT  her  imitators — not  only  among  the  actresses  of  the 
screen,  but  among  the  thousands  of  women  throughout  the 
world — what  of  them? 

For  the  screen  stars  are  imitated — of  that  there  is  no  doubt — 
and  if  this  new  type  of  woman  becomes  the  standard,  will  there 
be  a  place  for  the  sweet,  simple,  natural,  thoroughly  feminine 
type  which  has  inspired  the  world  for  ages  and  ages?  —  the 
secret  ideal  of  most  men  ? 

Fortunately,  even  caviar  becomes  tasteless  when  you  have 
had  too  much  of  it. 

This  new  sex  was  daring  and  therefore  attractive  as  long  as 
it  was  unique,  but  when  everyone  from  all  the  screen  stars  to 
your  next-door-neighbor  attempts  glamour,  it  becomes  just  a 
bore.

simplicity.     And  so  has  Constance  Bennett. 

Before  long,  Joan  Crawford  may  discover 
that  good,  honest  stories  concerning  the  prob- 
lems which  face  the  majority  of  girls  today 
are  better  than  highly  colored  yarns  about 
shady  ladies. 

When  she  does,  she  will  change  her  make 
up  and  her  mannerisms  and  come  back  to 
us  as  the  normal,  lovable,  girl  whom  we  have 
adored  from  the  beginning  of  her  stardom. 

PERHAPS  even  Garbo  will  change  when  she

sweet  scenes  in  ''As  You  Desire  Me."  Or 
perhaps  Garbo  and  Dietrich  are  the  two  women 
who  are  able  to  keep  on  being  shady  ladies, 
thereby  giving  us  the  spice  for  our  cinema 
sauce. 

And  we'll  find  in  Garbo  and  Dietrich  women 
to  watch  but  not  to  copy,  women  who  are  ex- 
ceptions rather  than  rules,  and  we'll  discover 
ourselves  looking  for  new  Marguerite  Clarks, 
May  Allisons,  Lillian  Gishes  and  Janet  Gay- 
nors  to  adore.

HER    HUSBAND  HER    SERVANTS 

HER     FRIENDS      •      •      •      BUT     HER 
DOCTOR     EXPLAINED     IT     AWAY! 


NO  matter  what  her  hus- 
band said  or  did,  it 
was  the  wrong  thing.  She 
was  irritable  with  old 
friends  and  couldn't  seem 
to  make  new  ones.  She  had 
headaches.  She  no  sooner 
got  rid  of  one  cold  than  she 
picked  up  another.  And  the  way  she 
looked!  .  .  .  her  eyes  .  .  .  her  skin.  Even 
her  hair  looked  dead. 

Said  the  doctor:  "The  fault,  my  dear 
girl,  lies  within  yourself.  What  you  need  is 
a  good  internal  cleansing — with  Sal 
Hepatica.  You're  being  poisoned  because 
of  improper  elimination,  and  consequent 
fermentation.  These  poisons  have  crept 
into  your  blood  stream." 

In  Europe  a  physician  will  ship  you  off 
to  one  of  the  great  spas — to  drink  the 


saline  waters  at  Carlsbad, 
Vichy  or  Aix. 

But  in  America,  you  can 
get  Sal  Hepaticaand  take  the 
saline  treatment  at  home. 
Sal  Hepatica  gently 
flushes  poisons  from  the  di- 
gestive tract.  It  counteracts 
acidity.  It  purifies  the  blood  stream.  It  gets  at 
the  cause  of  headaches,  indigestion,  colds, 
rheumatism.  It  clears  the  skin — brings 
back  freshness  to  the  complexion. 

Today,  get  a  bottle  of  Sal  Hepatica  and 
begin  the  saline  treatment.  Keep  inter- 
nally clean  for  one  week.  You'll  brighten 
up,  you'll  feel  better.  And  everything  will 
begin  to  go  right  instead  of  wrong!

The  Strange  Case  of 
Ann  Harding 

[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  32  ] 


subsided.  The  smile  was  too  near  a  tear. 
Nervous. 

Ann  Harding  of  this  year. 

A  smart  young  matron  from  the  East  looked 
unbelievingly  at  this  famous  star. 

A  Northern  representative  lifted  two  per- 
fectly arched  eyebrows  in  astonishment.  But 
a  lady  from  the  South  lifted  a  lace-trimmed 
handkerchief  to  her  trembling  mouth. 

It  was  too  pitiful. 

Ann  was  afraid.  For  women's  clubs, 
women's  church  societies,  and  just  women, 
from  all  over  the  United  States  have  sent  her 
scathing  messages. 

"How  dare  you  break  up  a  home  for  a  selfish 
career,"  they  demanded.     "How  dare  you?" 

They  forget  that  after  all  it  was  Harry  who 
wanted  to  be  free.  Ann  staying  at  home 
wouldn't  have  helped.  He  wanted  to  be  on 
his  own. 

And  try  to  hold  a  man  that  needs  and 
wants  his  freedom. 

AND  now  what  for  Ann? 
She's  in  a  spot.     She  knows  it.     And 
therein  lies  her  salvation. 

She's  fighting  to  come  back  stronger  than 
ever. 

Gradually  she  is  finding  her  way  out  of  the 
fog  of  bad  advice  and  rigidity  of  mind. 

She  is  trying  to  find  herself. 

Her  friends  hope  she  will  soon  return  to 
them.  That  once  again  her  phone  will  ring 
with  cheery  messages. 

It's  the  same  old  battle  of  one  woman  try- 
ing to  do  it  all.  It  can't  be  done.  Not  in  the 
making  of  movies,  or  the  business  of  life.  It 
can't  be  done. 

Chatterton  came  through  it,  a  finer,  surer 
actress.    Swanson  has  tried  to. 

Will  Ann? 

We  hope  so.  The  screen  needs  Ann  Hard- 
ing.   She  is  too  fine,  too  real  to  lose. 


It's  easy  to  see  where  Claudette  Col- 
bert got  her  beauty,  when  you  take  a 
look  at  Mama  Colbert.  Incidentally, 
Claudette  lives  with  her  mother, 
whenever  mama  is  in  town,  while  her 
husband,  Norman  Foster,  has  a  house 
by  himself.  No,  that's  not  a  Holly- 
wood idea — they've  been  occupying 
separate  establishments  almost  ever 
since   the  day  they    were    married 


WORLDS  APART 

yet  they  agree  on  this 

TOOTH  PASTE 


New  luster,  new  brilliance 

new  safety  with  this 

thrift  dentifrice 

One  woman  could  afford  to  pay  $2.00  a 
tube  for  tooth  paste  if  she  felt  like  it.  The 
other,  with  a  growing  family  to  look  out 
for,  must  shop  sharply.  Yet  both  are  con- 
stant users  of  Listerine  Tooth  Paste,  the 
quality  dentifrice  at  the  common  sense 
price. 

Both  have  discovered  from  actual  experi- 
ence, by  critical  comparison  with  other 
dentifrices,  that  Listerine  Tooth  Paste  ac- 
complishes amazing  results.  More  than  two 
million  women  have  discarded  fancy-priced 
brands  in  favor  of  Listerine  Tooth  Paste  at 
25  cents. 

If  you  are  open-minded,  we  think  you 
will  want  to  try  it  yourself.  You  will  never 
spend  a  quarter  more  wisely. 

When  you  begin  to  use  it,  you  will  see 
why  it  has  attained  such  tremendous  popu- 
larity. 

New  luster  and  brilliance 

Note  how  swiftly  and  thoroughly  it  cleans 
— but  how  gently.  Only  the  safest  of  in- 
gredients are  used. 


See  how  the  modern  polishing  agents  it 
contains  add  fresh  luster  and  brilliance  to 
teeth  that  used  to  be  dull. 

Note  how  quickly  these  agents  remove 
ugly  tartar,  unsightly  discolorations,  dis- 
gusting tobacco  stains. 

Firm,  healthy  gums 

After  you  have  used  this  paste  a  week,  ex- 
amine your  gums.  They'll  appear  healthier. 
And  feel  healthier. 

And  look  for  that  wonderful  feeling  of 
exhilaration  and  mouth  cleanliness  that 
follows  its  use — the  delightfully  refreshing 
effect  you  associate  with  Listerine  itself. 

A  common  sense  price 

Don't  forget  that  these  benefits  cost  you 
half  of  what  you  would  ordinarily  pay. 
Listerine  Tooth  Paste  costs  25^  the  large 
tube — a  product  as  good  as  the  name  it 
bears.

Listerine  Tooth  Paste  today.  Lambert

have  created  a  Frankenstein.  They  have  this 
tremendous  thing  and  do  not  always  know 
quite  what  to  do  with  it.  Pictures  interest  me 
—but  I  refuse  to  be  a  part  of  the  machine.  I 
could  never  be  happy  nor  do  my  best  work 
under  a  contract  that  did  not  allow  me  to  select 
the  roles  for  which  I  know  myself  to  be  best 
suited." 

AND  it's  my  hunch  that  before  there  are 
many  more  full  moons  at  Malibu,  movie- 
goers will  be  fed  up  with  those  all  too  obvious 
he-men  types  and  that  Leslie  Howard  will  open 
the  door  to  a  new  school.  Personally,  I've  al- 
ways been  just  a  little  suspicious  of  he-men. 
It  seems  to  me  that  when  a  man  must  slap 
another  man  on  the  back,  punch  him  playfully 
in  the  ribs  and  knock  women  around,  he  is 
making  too  great  an  effort  to  prove  his 
masculinity. 

Real  masculinity,  my  dears,  does  not  need  to 
be  proved. 

And  I'll  wager  that  it  won't  be  very  long  be- 
fore being  a  gentleman  will  be  a  better  movie 
trick  than  being  a  so-called  he-man. 

If  this  comes  to  pass,  just  point  with  pride  to 
the  Leslie  Howard  you  and  you  and  you  de- 
manded. He  will  be  responsible  for  the  new 
type.

**  \'<>  sir!  The  ex-soul  mate  of  Gloria 
Swanson,  Connie  Bennett,  Dorothy  Lee  and 
others  has  become  the  favorite  stag  at  all 
Hollywood  parties.  One  after  another,  his 
gals  up  and  marry  another  guy.  Joel  just 
smiles  serenely,  but  lets  it  slip  once  in  a  while 
that  he  can't  quite  understand  why  Connie 
preferred  a  Frenchman. 

"LTORRORS!    More  Garbo? 

A  yacht  full  of  press  folk  sailed 
over  to  Catalina  to  visit  Joan  Craw- 
ford's set  in  "Rain"  and  no  Joan  was 
to  be  found.  Finally  a  writer  located 
the  star  behind  a  bamboo  shack, 
trembling  with  fear.  For  Joan  has  as 
great  a  fear  of  crowds  as  Garbo  her- 
self, and  is  really  as  timid  as  a 
mouse. 

PEOPLE  for  miles  around  the  vicinity  of  the 

Fox  lot  were  awakened  in  the  wee  hours  of 

the    morning    recently    by    a    terrific    blast. 

Guests  at   the   fashionable   Beverly   Wilshire 


Hotel  thought  it  was  an  earthquake  and  many 
ran  into  the  street  in  their  nighties. 

But  the  blast  was  merely  an  explosion  to 
frighten  the  frogs!  It's  the  latest  way  to  make 
them  shut  up  so  they  can  record  scenes  at 
night  without  the  creaking  being  recorded  in 
the  microphone! 

JUST  try  to  make  monkeys  of  movie  star 
^shoppers  any  longer!  Heretofore,  as  soon  as 
a  star  entered  a  shop,  especially  those  exclu- 
sive ones  without  price  tags,  to  make  a  pur- 
chase, invariably  the  merchandise  price  shot 
upward.  And  often  doubled.  The  shopkeeper 
seeing  an  opportunity  to  make  a  little  extra  at 
their  expense. 

But  now.  A  movie  star  enters  a  shop,  ad- 
mires an  article  and  decides  to  come  back 
later.  An  hour  later,  their  purchasing  agent, 
as  he  is  known,  walks  into  the  shop,  admires 
the  same  article,  and  as  plain  Mr.  John  Jones, 
buys  it  at  the  original  low  price. 

Through  their  purchasing  agents,  Ricardo 
Cortez  saved  $300  on  a  horse,  Ann  Harding 
saved    several    hundred    dollars   on    clothing, 


The  marching  musketeers  of  M-G-M  — tra-la!  And  if  you  go  through 
Hollywood  with  a  fine  tooth  comb  you  won't  find  any  jollier  kids  than 
these  three— Karen  Morley,  Robert  Young  and  Mary  Carlisle.  The  girls 
found  Bob  just  as  he  was  coming  out  of  the  wardrobe  department  with  his 
consignment  of  clothes  for  the  next  scene.  These  youngsters  have  a 
right  to  be  happy — they've  all  had  great  screen  breaks  during  the  last  year

HAY  FEVER 

VICTIMS! 


Use  soft,  disposable 
KLEENEX   TISSUES 


HAY  FEVER  SUFFERERS -when  your 
nose  is  so  inflamed,  so  tender .  .  .  don't 
irritate  it  further  by  the  use  of  a  rough, 
damp  handkerchief.  Put  away  your  hand- 
kerchiefs and  use  nothing  but  Kleenex 
during  hay  fever  season. 

The  soft,  silky  texture  of  these  rayon - 
cellulose  tissues  makes  them  wonder- 
fully soothing  to  irritated  skin. 

Highly  absorbent 
Kleenex  is  highly  absorbent— much 
more  so  than  cotton  or 
linen.  It  is  always  soft 
and  dry,  because  you 
use  a  clean  tissue  every 
time!  What  a  relief  to  be 
rid  of  those  soggy  hand- 
kerchiefs! Rid  of  wash- 
ing them,  too  — because 


'KERFS 

are  a  formal  version  of  Kleenex; 
exquisite  tissues,  smartly  bor- 
dered .  .  .4 thicknesses  instead 
of  2.  Nice  enough  to  appear 
anywhere  as  handkerchiefs  or 
tea  napkins. 


Kleenex  is  destroyed  after  a  single  use. 
Naturally,  Kleenex  is  more  sanitary. 
Germs  multiply  rapidly  in  damp  hand- 
kerchiefs, making  them  unfit  to  carry. 
Kleenex  is  a  great  aid  in  applying 
make-up  evenly  and  naturally.  Mothers 
find  Kleenex  an  ideal  nursery  accessory. 

Now  in  two  sizes 

Kleenex  is  now  available  in  large  sheets, 
three  times  usual  size.  These  large  sheets 
areconvenientforguest  towels, for  dusting 
and  kitchen  use.  Youwili

""Pill,  wise  guys  of  Hollywood  who  stated  on 
every  occasion  that  Ann  Dvorak's  career 
was  considerably  damaged  when  she  married 
Leslie  Fenton  are  looking  a  l)it  silly. 

For  it  was  the  one  break  Ann  needed!  Fen- 
ton, one  grand  actor,  knows  the  game,  forward 
and  backward.  And  he's  teaching  Ann  tricks 
that  would  have  taken  her  years  to  learn.  He 
watches  her  scenes  like  a  hawk.  One  mistake 
and  Les  is  at  her.    She  doesn't  make  it  again. 

As  a  result  she's  gone  up  like  a  sky-rocket. 
And  no  matter  what  the  outcome  of  this  mar- 
riage, it  was  the  best  thing  Ann  Dvorak  could 
have  done  to  hasten  that  climb  upward! 

XTEWLYWEDS,  listen! 

Know  the  newest  and  smartest  thing  yet 
and  originated  by  none  other  than  that  bright 
little  originator,  Constance  Bennett?  It's  the 
six  months  anniversary  party, and  it'scalled  the 
cellophane  anniversary.  Every  thing  comes 
wrapped  in  bright  colored  cellophane.  And 
what  a  grand  excuse  for  a  party!  Especially  if 
those  first  six  months  have  been  happy  ones, 
as  Constance's  seem  to  have  been. 

Try  it  on  your  friends  Mrs.  Bride!  It's 
brand-new. 

A  T  Albuquerque,  N.M.,  relates 
■^^ columnist  Walter  Winchell,  Dick 
Barthelmess  was  busy  autographing 
things  during  the  fifteen  minute  stop. 

"Must  be  tough,"  commented  a 
bystander,  "to  be  bothered  by  all 
these  autograph  hounds." 

"Must  be  tougher,"  said  Dick, 
scratching  his  name  on  a  proffered 
cuff,  "when  they  stop  asking!" 

f^LD  Buddy  Rogers  (no  more  of  this 
^~/ii Charles"  stuff)  is  as  chirpy  as  a  cricket 
away  from  the  studios. 

"I  like  radio  much  better  than  pictures," 
says  Bud.  "  I  can  reach  as  many  people  on  the 
air  in  one  night  as  I  would  in  weeks  on  the 
screen." 

Buddy  and  his  band  are  dance-tooting  at  the 
Pennsylvania  Hotel  Roof  in  New  York  all 
summer.  He  recently  flew  to  Hollywood  on 
investment  business,  stopping  off  in  Kansas 
City  to  visit  Pop  Rogers,  who  had  just  been 
operated  on.  Incidentally,  old  Bud  doesn't 
seem  to  have  an  extra-super-special  girl  friend 
at  present.    Still  heart-whole,  girls! 

rpHE  little  birds  have  been  busy,  this  month. 
They  also  report  a  disturbance  in  the 
Marian  Nixon-Eddie  Hillman  menage.  The 
story  about  their  adopting  a  child  is  being 
given  credit  by  the  know-it-alls  as  so  much 
bologna. 

Again — career  versus  marriage.  Marian 
was  just  making  small  and  infrequent  inde- 
pendent pictures  when  she  married  millionaire- 
scion,  Eddie.  Now  she's  a  big  shot  at  Fox, 
with  stardom  in  the  offing.  It  does  make  a 
difference.  There's  so  much  less  time  for  her 
to  devote  to  hubby! 

•THEY  took  a  love-scene  in  "Red  Headed 

Woman.''  between  Jean  Harlow  and  Ches- 
ter Morris,  twenty-seven  times.  The  one 
in  the  telephone  booth.     Hard  to  shoot. 

98 


And  each  shot,  contrary  to  custom,  was 
better  than  the  one  before! 

"  How  can  you  act  the  same  scene  over  and 
over  and  do  it  better  each  time?"  someone 
asked  Chester. 

"That  wasn't  acting,"  Chester  answered. 
"That  kind  of  scene  is  just  natural  when  you 
are  making  it  with  Jean  Harlow!" 

A  X  acquaintance  of  Josef  Von  Sternberg's 

told  us  that  he  ran  into  the  director  on  the 

day  he  and  his  protege,  Marlene  Dietrich,  re- 


turned to  the  Paramount  lot  after  the  fracas 
about  a  story. 

"Well,  Joe.  You  surely  got  a  lot  of  news- 
paper space  on  that  row.  It  was  a  splendid 
publicity  stunt  for  The  Blonde  Venus.  You're 
sure  to  have  another  box-office  smash." 

"Oh,  no.  It  was  not  a  publicity  stunt!  It 
was — " 

"  Xow,  don't  kid  us,  Joe!  That  was  really 
clever!" 

"Oh,  veil!"  Von  Sternberg  smiled,  as  be 
shrugged  his  shoulders. 


Now  who  would  have  thought  that  it  was  Conrad  Nagel,  the  good  boy 
of  the  screen,  who  started  the  punch-the-heroine-in-the-jaw  vogue? 
Remember  "Free  Love,"  in  which  Conrad  and  Genevieve  Tobin  played 
together?  Why,  that  was  before  Clark  Gable  was  heard  of,  yet  Conrad 
gave  Genevieve  a  good  rousing  sock — as  this  still  from  the  picture  testifies

T\  7ELL,  Marie  Dressier  has  answered  all 
^^  this  gossip  about  her  being  ready  to  give 
up  the  battle  by  purchasing  one  of  the  largest 
homes  in  Beverly  Hills.  Twenty  rooms,  ex- 
tensive grounds,  and  so  on. 

"What  does  Marie  Dressier  want  with  such 
a  huge  place?"  is  one  of  the  common  questions 
of  the  month. 

Marie  wants  to  live  the  last  few  years  of  her 
life  to  the  fullest !  If  she  must  rest  a  lot  as  she 
has  been  doing,  why  not  rest  in  luxury  and 
peace  and  inspiring  surroundings?  For  the 
first  time  in  her  life,  she  can  afford  it.  This 
house  is  like  the  toys  she  missed  in  her  poverty- 
stricken  childhood.  She  goes  from  room  to 
room  peeping  into  one  corner  after  another. 
She  will  never  tire  of  the  pride  of  possession  it 
brings  her.  A  little  girl  with  the  biggest  doll  in 
town.    That's  Marie  Dressier — God  bless  her! 

A  ND  then  there's  the  producer 
"**"who  was  asked  his  opinion  on  a 
certain  question  and  gave  it. 

"I  still  think,"  he  said,  "that  all 
advertising  should  go  to  New  York 
and  disintegrate  from  there." 

TT  wasn't  Friday  and  it  wasn't  the  thirteenth, 
but  to  Sally  Filers  it  was  just  one  of  those 
days! 

Early  in  the  morning  she  received  a  wire 
telling  of  the  death  of  a  close  relative.  Half  an 
hour  later  her  mother  screamed  over  the 
phone,  "Your  father  is  dying  and  he  wants  to 
see  you."  When  she  came  to,  fifteen  minutes 
later,  she  discovered  her  mother  and  father 
had  been  in  an  automobile  accident,  on  the 
way  to  her  home. 

She  put  in  a  rush  call  for  her  husband, 
Hoot  Gibson,  at  the  studio  and  together  they 
dashed  to  the  receiving  hospital. 

Nervous  and  shaken,  she  arrived  home  an 
hour  later  to  find  the  colored  cook  gloriously 
pie-eyed  and  imagining  herself  a  knife  thrower. 
More  wild  calls  for  Hoot  and  the  police,  who 
finally  quieted  the  hilarious  cook  and  Sally  went 
to  bed  with  a  nervous  collapse. 

Just  one  of  those  nice  quiet  days  in  Holly- 
wood!   Like  the  Western  Front. 

•"THE  last  show  was  over  in  a  small  Holly- 
wood  theater  when,  suddenly,  the  audience 
was  startled  to  see  a  young  woman  bearing 
down  upon  the  attendants  with  a  wild  gleam 
in  her  eye! 

They  recognized  her  as  the  star  of  the  pic- 
ture they  had  just  seen,  "Shanghai  Express." 
It  was  the  glamorous  Dietrich  herself.  And 
mad  as  a  wet  hen ! 

It  seems  that  certain  scenes  had  been  left 
out  of  the  picture  and  Marlene  was  out  to 
know  why. 

And  who  was  to  blame. 

And  while  Josef  Von  Sternberg,  the  director, 
Marlene's  husband,  and  Maurice  Chevalier 
paced  up  and  down  before  the  theater,  Dietrich 
and  the  operator  argued. 

It  seems  the  operator  ran  the  picture  exact- 
ly as  it  came  to  the  theater,  and  Marlene 
retired — still  raging! 

T  OVELY  Mary  Astor,  who  has  had  more 
than  her  share  of  anguish,  is  about  the 
happiest  mama  Hollywood  has  ever  known. 

Her  little  daughter,  born  in  Honolulu,  is  the 
darling  of  her  heart  and  the  apple  of  both 
optica  of  the  proud  papa,  Dr.  Franklyn  Thorpe. 

Heaven  knows  Mary  deserves  such  joy.  In- 
cidentally, a  movement  among  joking  chums 
to  name  the  infant  "Hula"  was  immediately 
squelched.

When  rumor  was  rife  that  Garbo  was  going  home  her  good  boss  Irving 
Thalberg,  up  there  in  the  corner,  gave  her  the  most  gorgeous  traveling 
bag  that  could  be  designed,  especially  made  by  a  high-class  shop, 
Alexander  and  Oviatt.  It  is  genuine  maroon  colored  Morocco  leather, 
twenty-two  inches  long,  fourteen  inches  wide  and  six  and  a  half  inches 
high.  The  outside  of  the  bag  is  simple  and  bears  merely  the  square 
block  monogram  "G.  G."  Inside,  the  solid  gold  fittings  are  initialed  like 
the  outside.  The  glass  containers  are  hand-etched  and  trimmed  in 
solid  gold.  The  lining  is  dark  brown  moire.  Leather  from  England, 
glass  etched  in  Austria  and  gold  from  France.  It  took  twelve  months 
to  make — a  grand  going-away  present,  but  now  they  say  she  isn't  going 
away.    Well,  it's  a  swell  bag  anyhow  to  think  about  using  some  day 


VI  THEN  the  report  that  Garbo  was  going 
home  was  hottest,  Supervisor  Bernie 
Finemarj  was  dispatched  by  the  Powers  to  see 
if  he  could  get  the  straight  dope. 

He  decided  to  use  craft.  Going  on  the  set, 
he  held  out  his  hand  to  Greta  and  said,  "Well, 
goodbye,  Miss  Garbo." 

He  expected  her  to  commit  herself,  one  way 
or  another. 

But  Greta  just  held  out  her  paddy  and  said, 
"Oh,  are  you  going  away,  Mr.  Fineman?" 

And  Bernie  retired  in  confusion,  gnashing 
his  teeth. 

And  some  people  have  called  her  a  dumb 
Swede ! 

JOAN  BENNETT  made  a  record  on  "The 
J  Trial  of  Vivienne  Ware." 

She  went  through  the  entire  production 
without  muffing  a  line.  Xot  one  re-take  was 
made! 

When  Janet  Gaynor  heard  it.  she  determined 
to  equal  the  record.  She  couldn't  have  any 
other  young  lady  on  her  lot  putting  one  over 
on  her.  So  she  bet  director  William  K. 
Howard,  her  cameraman  and  the  assistant  di- 
rector on  "The  First  Year"  that  she  would 
not  make  a  mistake  throughout  the  picture.    In- 

100 


cidentally,  W.  K.  Howard  had  megaphoned 
Joan  through  her  glory,  which  gave  Janet  a 
double  inspiration. 

They  were  in  the  second  week  of  the  picture. 
Janet's  throat  went  dry.  The  words  wouldn't 
come!  She  stopped,  walked  from  the  set, 
shook  hands  with  the  three  men  she  had  bet 
and  handed  each  his  five  dollars. 

•"TRUST  Tallulah! 

Four  of  her  wisdom  teeth  had  to  come 
out.  "Take  them  out  all  at  once!"  ordered 
la  Bankhead. 

The  dentist  demurred.  One  this  week, 
possibly  one  the  next. 

"  Will  you  do  it,  or  do  I  have  to  get  someone 
else?" 

Out  they  came — one  immediately  after  the 
other! 

The  result — Tallulah  lost  ten  pounds,  and 
her  gowns  for  "Devil  and  the  Deep."  which 
were  all  ready  for  her  to  start  work  with  Gary 
Cooper,  had  to  be  made  completely  over.  And 
she's  still  on  a  milk  diet!

cially his  own. 


For  years  Jack  tried  to  make  the  exclusive 
Tuna  Club  of  Catalina,  and  for  years  one  old 
meanie  blackballed  him.  At  last  the  blackballer 
died,  and  John  crashed  merrily  in. 

A  week  after  youn«  Jack,  Jr.,  was  bom  Pop 
startled  other  members  by  putting  baby  up 
for  membership. 

History  must  not  repeat  itself!"  smiled  the 
old  man.  as  he  filed  the  peppers  with  the  mem- 
bership committee. 

"L.TAS  Spencer  Tracy  known  hard 
luck?    Has  Spencer  been  down? 

"Why  listen,"  Spence  said.  "My 
pants  were  so  thin  that  I  could  sit  on 
a  dime  and  tell  whether  it  was  heads  or 
tails." 

And,  gentlemen,  that's  being 
down. 

"L-TKRIl'S  a  dainty  tidbit  to  roll  about  the 
*■  -"-palate ! 

As  you  all  know.  Garbo  never  talks  to  people 
working  on  her  set.  It's  a  far  stricter  rule  than 
the  Moral  Law. 

But  something  happened  during  the  making 
of  "As  You  Desire  Me"  that  still  has  the 
Metro  lot  gassing.  X'o  one  but  the  flighty 
genius,  Herr  Eric  Yon  Stroheim,  crashed 
through  that  stone-wall  reserve  that  cuts  off 
the  Swede  from  mere  mortals. 

Several  times,  on  that  set,  Von  was  noted 
sitting  on  a  chair,  with  the  great  woman  sitting 
on  the  floor  at  his  feet  listening  to  the  gems  of 
wisdom  that  fell  like  pearls  from  his  lips! 

The  end  of  the  world  would  have  caused 
less  buzzing. 

And  I  hear  that  the  two  have  been  seeing 
each  other  since  the  picture  was  finally  put  in 
the  can  and  sent  to  the  screens.  Ah,  we  always 
said  that  Yon  had  Something! 

"V"OU'YE  heard  about  that  pin  of  jewels 
which  Joan  Blondell  got  from  her  sweetie, 
George  Barnes?  It's  a  basket  with  102  dia- 
monds, four  rubies,  three  emeralds  and  two 
onyxes.  She  spent  the  first  week  after  she  re- 
ceived it  showing  it  to  everybody. 

And  one  night  when  she  arrived  home  it  was 
gone !  She  was  a  mad  person !  She  telephoned 
the  studio.  The  night  watchman  went  to  her 
dressing  room  and  found  it  on  the  floor,  exactly 
where  she  had  dropped  it. 

Xbw  it's  in  a  safety  deposit  box.  "  I  only  use 
it  on  Sundays."  Joan  said  seriously,  "I  take  it 
out  every  Saturday  night  and  put  it  back  every 
Monday  morning.  A  girl  as  careless  as  I  am 
can't  risk  it  more  than  one  day  a  week!" 

""THOSE  who  would  have  you  believe  Con- 
stance  Bennett  is  high-hat  beyond  all 
endurance  have  probably  forgotten  that,  after 
all.  Connie  is  a  lady  of  title  who  has  never  seen 
tit  to  advertise  it! 

For  instance,  her  stationery  and  calling 
cards  are  free  from  the  de  Falaise  coat  of  arms. 
Her  limousine  doors  are  ditto.  The  Christmas 
cards  that  go  to  business  acquaintances  bear 
the  simple  signature  of  Constance  Bennett. 

Those  to  close  friends  are  signed  "Constance 
and  Henri  de  la  Falaise." 

Her  secretary  calls  her  Miss  Bennett,  her 
servants  "Madame"  but  to  the  boys  at  the 
studio  she's  "Connie."

/""V\RBO  and  Dietrich  have  the  same  tailor. 
^-^And  is  that  tailor  on  pins  and  needles  about 
keeping  their  appointments  straight! 

For  instance,  it  wouldn't  do  for  Miss  Garbo 
and  Miss  Dietrich  to  occupy  the  center  of  the 
stage  at  once,  as  neither  girl  will  be  bothered 
with  curtained  booths. 

They  take  their  fittings,  like  good  fellows,  out 
in  the  open. 

And  that  tailor  himself  has  a  picnic  trying 
Garbo's  clothes  on  Dietrich  and  Dietrich's  on 
Garbo  without  either  girl  knowing  just  whose 
clothes  they  are! 

And  do  they  go  into  raptures  over  each 
other's  garments! 

If  they  only  knew! 

For  a  going-away  coat,  Garbo  spied  a  brown 
tweed  coat  that  took  her  eye.  Nothing  would 
do  but  she  must  have  that  coat  copied  for 
herself. 

It  was.  But  what  Greta  didn't  know  was 
that  the  coat  belonged  to  a  Mr.  Josef  Von 
Sternberg. 

And  a  copy  of  a  coat  belonging  to  Marlene's 
director  will  take  itself  back  to  Sweden. 

Strange  how  the  lives  of  these  two  women 
have  crossed  and  recrossed  without  their  ever 
meeting!

car,  missing  Chevalier  by  a  hair's  breadth.  And 
never  recognizing  him!  Marlene  Dietrich  and 
little  Maria  slip  into  a  movie.  Peter  the  Her- 
mit, Hollywood's  pet,  swings  along  on  bare 
feet,  wearing  a  bright  red  beret.  A  living 
symbol  of  that  boulevard  called  Hollywood! 

~V\  70XDER  if  John  Barrymore's  perform- 
ance  in  "Grand  Hotel  "has  caused  as 
much  talk  out  of  Hollywood  as  it  has  in?  He's 
a  straight  leading  man  for  the  first  time  in  years! 
No  "Sea  Beast"  eccentricities,  you  know. 

Most  of  Hollywood  likes  him  better  this  way. 
In  fact,  most  of  the  screen  ladies  would  like  a 
chance  to  play  straight,  undiluted  romance 
with  John — after  seeing  him  make  love  to 
Garbo.  He's  getting  as  many  "ohs"  and  "ahs" 
as  Clark  Gable  did  in  "Possessed"  with  Joan 
Crawford. 

Here's  a  funny  thing!  Jack  plays  a  straight 
leading  man  after  he's  adopted  a  straight  role 
in  life.  He  used  to  be  as  eccentric  off  the 
screen  as  on.  He  was  a  weird  one.  Walked 
down  Hollywood  Boulevard  singing  in  the  wee 
hours  of  the  morning,  and  all  that.  But  now! 
A  model  husband!  Father,  for  the  second  time. 
Home  every  night  to  help  take  care  of  wine, 
Dolores  Costello.  and  the  babies.

Ann  Harding  has  been  made  an  honorary 
colonel  in  the  Rainbow  Division  in  honor  of 
her  father,  the  late  General  Gatley — who  had  a 
war-time  command  in  that  outfit? 

The  Gablish  Eskimo,  Chee-Ak,  hit  of  "Ig- 
loo," is  half  Jewish  and  half  Eskimo,  and  is 
known  in  Hollywood  as  Harry  Wise,  a  Fox 
cameraman? 

Jackie  Coogan,  being  seventeen,  goes  to 
Santa  Clara  College  next  fall? 

Slim  Summerville  was  the  only  "All  Quiet" 
boy  who  wasn't  knocked  off  during  the  story, 
and  therefore  rates  a  part  in  the  sequel  "The 
Road  Back"? 

George  Arliss'  real  handle  is  George  Augus-

Hollywood  shops  are  selling  ducky  little 
corsets  for  those  plumpish  male  stars?  And 
that  they  are  selling  plenty  of  them? 

Ricardo  Cortez,  after  starring  in  "Is  My 
Face  Red?"  is  now  assigned  to  "The  Man 
Without  a  Face  "?    Lay  off  Ric's  face — it's  fine. 

Marie  Dressier  entertains  more  genuine

■D  EMEMBER  Clara  Kimball  Young,  a  great 
■*-^and  famous  star  of  just  a  few  years  ago? 

Now  almost  forgotten,  and  lying  ill  from  in- 
juries, Clara's  beautiful  furnishings,  various 
objects  of  art  and  a  beautiful  lace  handkerchief 
given  her  by  Queen  Marie,  have  been  sold  at 
auction.  The  lovely  costumes  worn  by  Miss 
Young  in  her  former  pictures,  remained  unsold. 
No  one,  it  seems  wanted  these  reminders  of 
the  days  when  Clara  played  in  "My  Official 
Wife,"  "The  Deep  Purple,"  and  the  rest. 

Moving  into  smaller  quarters,  Miss  Young 
no  longer  had  room  for  her  treasures. 

Clara's  accident  brought  out  the  fact  that 
she's  been  married  four  years! 

f\  VERHEARD  in  the  Brown  Derby. 
^Two  beautiful  brunettes  were 
talking. 

"No,"  one  said,  "I  don't  go  out 
with  actors  any  more.  They're  as 
nice  as  any  other  fellows  for  a  while, 
but  I  never  knew  one  that  wouldn't, 
eventually,  right  out  of  a  clear  sky,  go 
profile  on  you!" 

T7VER  hear  of  ptomaine  bringing  two  souls 
■^together? 

They  tell  a  funny  one  of  how  ZaSu  Pitts  be- 
came friends  with  Garbo. 

ZaSu  was  cast  for  a  comedy  part  in  one  of 
Garbo's  earlier  films,  and  the  first  day  of  the 
shooting,  ZaSu  was  seized  with  a  case  of  pto- 
maine. Not  wanting  to  lose  the  part,  ZaSu 
went  onto  the  set  and  took  her  ptomaine  with 
her. 

Between  scenes  she  sat  off  in  a  corner,  a  sad 
and  lonely  figure. 

Garbo  spied  her  and  thinking  that  here,  too, 
was  a  kindred  soul  aloof  from  the  world,  they 
became  fast  friends. 

"DEN  LYON,  as  you  know,  is  one  of 
"^Hollywood's  best  aviators.  "How 
do  the  producers  feel  about  all  this 
fancy  flying?"  some  one  asked  Ben. 
"That,"  grinned  Ben,  "depends 
mostly  on  what  they  think  of  your  last 
picture!" 

•"THAT  little  Southern  babe,  Una  Merkel, 
strolled  into  a  fortune  teller's  recently  for  a 
reading. 

"Don't  worry,  dear,"  the  soothsayer  said, 
"you'll  find  the  right  man  soon.  In  fact  you'll 
be  married  within  the  year." 

And  poor  Una  walked  out  a  bit  groggy.  She 
has  been  a  happy  bride  for  six  months! 

DAMON  NOVARRO  had  planned 
•*■  to  scud  over  to  Europe  this  sum- 
mer to  begin  his  memoirs,  dash  off  a 
novel  and  so  on.  He's  deadly  serious 
about  a  writing  career.  Instead,  he 
decided  to  stick  closer  to  home.  So 
he's  bought  a  hideaway  ranch  as  a 
writing  retreat,  ;and  won't  tell  a  soul 
where  it  is.     Peek-a-boo,  Ramon! 

"N/TOT  so  many  years  ago  Joan  Crawford  was 
trying  to  promote  a  romance  between  a 
little  dancer  and  that  big,  blond  football  hero, 
Marshall  Duffield. 

The  romance  didn't  quite  come  off,  but  the 
dancer,  whom  Joan  called  her  "protege"  with 
a  note  of  pride  in  the  voice,  was  Ann  Dvorak — 
the  feminine  sensation  of  "Scarface"  and  the 
girl  they'll  all  tell  you  is  halfway  to  big-time 
stardom  already!  When  Joan  was  introduc- 
ing her  around,  everybody  thought  it  was 
just  another  case  of  Crawford  enthusiasm  on 
the    loose.      How  wrong  they  were! 


OILY-HAIRED  GIRLS 

see  what  the  microscope  reveals  about  your  hair 


Oily  hair — limp,  lank,  stringy.  How  dis- 
tressing it  looks  in  a  close-up ! 

Now  look  at  the  micro-diagram.  That 
object  which  looks  like  a  tree  trunk  is 
really  a  hair  magnified  many  times.  See 
the  little  plume-like  sacs  beside  it?  These 
are  sebaceous  (oil)  glands.  They  empty 
oil  (really  grease)  to  lubricate  your  scalp 
and  hair.  There  are  over  900  of  these  oil 
glands  to  every  square  inch  of  scalp! 

You  can  really  understand  why  your 
hair  looks  greasy  if  every  one  of  the  900 
glands  per  inch  is  just  a  little  over-active. 

The  Packer  Company  has  made  a  sham- 
poo especially  for  oily  hair  .  .  .  Packer's 


Pine  Tar  Shampoo  .  .  .  This  is  a  mildly 
astringent  shampoo. 

Use  it  as  often  as  you  need  to — every 
three  or  four  days,  if  necessary.  Notice 
how  soft  and  fluffy  it  leaves  your  hair. 

FOK  DKY  HAIK  .  .  .  Packer  also  makes  an  emol- 
lient shampoo  for  dry  hair:  Packer's  Olive  Oil  Shampoo. 
This  shampoo  contains  nothing  which  tends  to  dry  out 
the  scalp.  Because  it  contains  soothing,  softening  glycer- 
ine, it  leaves  the  hair  silkier  and  easier  to  manage.

Remember! 
The 

DOCTOR 

knows  best 


There  is  no  excuse  for  taking  the  slightest  gam- 
hie  with  your  health  by  using  laxatives  made 
by  secret  formulas. 

The  odds  are  all  against  you. 

When  makers  refuse  to  divulge  their  formu- 
las for  doctors  to  study,  it  is  probably  because 
they  realize  that  such  formulas  might  not  meet 
with  medical  approval. 

Harmful  after-effects  may  hide  behind  l.ixa- 
tives  with  secret  formulas.  Such  laxatives, 
often  habit-forming,  do  more  harm  than  good. 

Doctors  approve  of  Ex-Lax 

A  laxative,  says  the  doctor,  should   be  mild 

and  gentle. 
It  should  not  rush  food  through  the  stomach. 
It  should  not  disturb  digestion. 
It  should  limit  its  action  to  the  intestines. 
It  should  not  gripe. 
It  should  not  be  habit-forming. 

Ex-Lax  checks  on  each  of  these  requirements. 

The  only  medicinal  ingredient  of  Ex-Lax  is 
phenolphthalein,  a  laxative  known  to  the 
medical  profession  throughout  the  world. 

This  phenolphthalein,  in  the  right  quality,  in 
the  right  proportion,  in  the  right  dose — is  com- 
bined with  a  delicious  chocolated  base,  which 
makes  Ex-Lax  popular  with  children. 

Ex-Lax  acts  by  bringing  the  bowels  back  to 
gentle  activity.  It  stimulates  the  intestines, 
does  not  "whip"  them  into  action. 

Insist  on  Ex-Lax 
to  get  Ex-Lax  results 

Just  "any"  chocolate  laxative  won't  do!  Get 
genuine  Ex-Lax — take  it  tonight!  At  all  drug

Name 




T  VCKIE  COOPER,  who  won't  be  nine  years 

Jold  until  September,  is  a  thoroughly  disil- 
lusioned young  man.  He  is  definitely  off  dames 
and  Mitzi  Green  is  to  blame. 

Mitzi — one  of  those  "older  women''  in 
every  man's  life — double-crossed  Jackie,  and 
young  Cooper  is  pretty  sore  about  it. 

"I  spent  plenty  money  on  Mitz,"  he  said, 
bitterly,  "about  five  dollars  every  time  she 
came  to  Malibu.  And  what  did  she  do?  She 
threw  me  over  for  Junior  Coghlan!" 

A  \\T  HARDING  isn't  finding  it  so  pleasant 
all  alone  in  the  old  family  mansion  except 
for  a  mess  of  servants.  Hollywood  police 
hurried  to  the  place  when  someone  telephoned 
"Help!  Murder!"  They  found  that  the  you  1- 
ing  of  a  stray  pup  had  kept  the  whole  Hardin  ; 
household  awake.  Just  how  anybody  figured 
murder  out  of  that  no  one  knows.  No  doubt 
the  cops  muttered  into  their  long  white  beards 
as  they  went  back  to  their  checker  game.  The 
point  seems  to  be  that  Annie  is  a  bit  lonely. 


Here's  how  to  make  cellophane  accessories.  Rochelle  Hudson's  hands  show 
you.  But  that's  Gloria  Stuart  decked  out  in  belt,  hat  band  and  bracelet. 
Cut  the  cellophane  cigarette  wrapping  to  three  and  a  half  by  three  inches. 
Fold  lengthwise  through  center.  Open  it  and  fold  two  edges  to  meet  center 
fold.  Fold  in  center  again  and  press  fold  to  a  sharp  ridge.  Fold  this  strip 
once  more  and  you  have  a  piece  of  cellophane  about  half  an  inch  wide,  three 
end  a  half  inches  long  and  eight  thicknesses.  This  strip  is  folded  in  center, 
oiened  again,  and  the  two  edges  folded  to  meet  at  center  ridge.  That's  the 
first  link  in  bracelet  or  belt.  Repeat  process  with  a  second  piece  of  same  size. 
Slip  the  two  ends  of  one  oblong  through  the  opening  of  the  other  and  you  have 
a  V-shaped  piece.  Slip  third  link  through  end  of  those  already  joined  and 
the  belt  is  started.  Keep  that  up  for  about  fifty  links  and  sew  on  buckle  or 
clasp.  The  bracelet  must  end  in  links  that  can  be  fastened  together.  Pull 
out  ends  of  one  link  and  put  them  through  ends  of  link  to  which  it  is  to  be 
fastened.  Turn  in  these  ends  and  push  them  into  place  through  center  of 
other  link.     There,  that's  the  whole   trick.     It's  Hollywood's  newest  fad!

HpHREE  names  pop  from  the  great  past  of 
pictures. 

Lillian  Gish  has  been  playing  pore  ole  Ca-

It's  an  attempt  to  make  the  famous  old  mining 
camp,  long  abandoned,  a  headquarters  for  the 
summer-tourist  drama. 

June  Caprice  (does  THAT  name  take  you 
back,  old-timer?)  has  been  doing  a  little  suing 
in  Hollywood.  What  an  ethereal  beauty  June 
was  in  her  Fox  starring  days — blonde,  and  oh 
how  wistful! 

And  Betty  Bronson,  whose  Peter  Pan  was 
the  beginning  and  practically  the  end  of  her 
great  film  career,  has  gone  thoroughly  domes- 
tic. Married  to  one  Ludwig  Lauerhaus,  a 
financier,  she  has  settled  down  quietly  in  the 
mountains  of  Asheville,  N.  C.  "Mrs.  Lauer- 
haus now  has  no  picture  ideas,"  says  the  spouse, 
in  all  sincerity.

"not  sexy  enough.  Should  be  called 
"The  Bitter  Yen  of  General  Tea!" 

A  HOLLYWOOD  trade  paper  carried  a 
spicy  tale  of  an  unnamed  but  prominent 
comedian  on  a  major  lot.  And  the  next  day 
five  studios  phoned  into  the  paper  wanting  to 
know  how  they  dare  say  such  things  about  their 
star.     Ah,  these  funny  men  in  the  movies!

funniest  actors  — what's  more,  he  isn't  one  of  those  Pagliacci  guys  with

^\URICE  CHEVALIER  has  refused  a

in  the  Garbo  class.  She's  the  only  other  one  to 
have  refused  this  Hollywood  luxury. 

Most  of  the  stars  use  their  tiny  palaces  to 
learn  their  lines,  sleep,  relax,  and  so  on.  When 
the  studio  offered  him  such  a  retreat  at  the 
beginning  of  "Love  Me  Tonight,"  he  said  that 
he  learned  his  lines  and  did  his  sleeping  at 
home. 

He  would  spend  his  time,  when  not  working 
himself,  behind  the  cameras  watching  others 
work.  "I  might  learn  something."  he  added.

are  hopping  about  Europe  just  now — Kay's 
first  real  holiday  since  she  hit  Hollywood  over 
three  years  ago. 

Three  months  of  glorious  rambling  over  the 
old  world,  that's  the  reward  for  Kay  and  Ken. 
Serious-minded,  they  are  taking  in  the  great 
Reinhardt  drama  festival  at  Salzburg.  Then 
they  will  go  to  the  island  of  Majorca  to  do  a 
bit  of  fancy  loafing.  Then  home  to  the  chain- 
gangs  of  Hollywood  again.

T^\ID  the  jealousy  between  Bert  Wheeler  and 
"^Robert  Woolsey  get  the  better  of  Wheeler, 
or  was  it  his  desire  to  play  vaudeville  with 
Dorothy  Lee? 

Woolsey  doesn't  know.  It  wasn't  salary,  be- 
cause a  year  and  a  half  ago  when  the  two  had 
their  big  split  about  money,  Radio  made  the 
pay  checks  equal,  approximately  $2,000  per 
week  each. 

When  Woolsey  discovered  his  side-kick  had 
jumped  East  without  even  a  by-your-leave  and 
left  their  Columbia  contract  for  a  picture  flat. 
he  lit  out  for  Mexico.  Going  to  see  about  a  bull- 
light  story  and  get  local  color. 

When  he  returns,  he  plans  to  get  another 
partner  (possibly  Harry  Langdon)  and  produce 
the  yarn  himself — unless  some  company  ups 
and  finances  it  for  him! 

1P\0N'T  get  too  excited  about  those 
— '^little  black  cigars  that  Garbo 
smokes  in  her  last  picture  "As  You 
Desire  Me."  For,  believe  it  or  not, 
they  aren't  cigars,  fans!  They're 
just  plain  cigarettes  in  exotic  black 
wrappings.     A  new  fad,  maybe? 


TF  you  don't  think  Claudette  Colbert  had  a 

tough  time  during  her  first  week  of  work  on 
"The  Man  From  Yesterday"  with  Clive 
Brook,  list  to  this,  my  children: 

They  called  for  the  picture  to  begin  on  the 
day  she  was  moving  into  her  new  home  in  the 
Outpost  estates.  And  if  you've  never  tried 
moving  and  starting  a  picture  on  the  same  day, 
you  ain't  had  no  difficulties. 

The  next  day,  Hollywood  discovered  that 
her  husband,  Xorman  Foster,  was  not  moving 
into  the  house  with  her.  He  had  taken  his  own 
place.  There  were  twenty  reporters  on  the  set 
when  she  arrived  and  there  were  twenty-five 
at  her  home  when  she  returned  that  night. 
And  if  you've  never  tried  telling  forty-five  men 
that  you  live  separately  from  your  husband 
because  it  makes  love  more  interesting,  that  it 
doesn't  mean  divorce — then  you've  never  tried 
talking! 

And  the  third  day,  she  came  down  with  a 
case  of  sinus.  Result  of  too  much  nervous  ex- 
citement. Stop  work?  Of  course  not.  The 
picture  was  in  production.  But  she  did  have 
to  report  to  the  doctor  twice  a  day  for  treat- 
ments. And  if  you've  never  tried  sneaking  oil 
a  set  twice  a  day — you've  never  tried  sneaking. 

And  the  fourth  day  her  mother  arrived  from 
Xew  York  for  a  visit.  Her  mother  has  been  ill 
— is  recuperating.  And  the  fifth — Claudette 
threw  up  her  hands.  "I  am  nuts,  simply 
nuts!   I  can't  talk  to  anyone  or  see  anyone!" 

And  now  they'll  probably  call  her  tempera- 
mental!    Ye  gods! 

YX7ALTER  WIXCHELL,  the  columnist, 
was  in  Hollywood  recovering  from  a 
nervous  breakdown.  Everyone  protected 
Walter's  shattered  nerves — except  Buster  Kea- 
ton.  Walter  was  in  Buster's  dressing  room 
when  Buster's  colored  man  entered  and  rarg 
a  big  cow-bell.  Winchell  grasped  the  arms  of 
his  chair  and  shuddered. 

"Tea  time,"  Buster  explained. 

A  few  moments  later  the  boy  entered  with  a 
huge  tray  of  tea  things.  Just  inside  the  door 
he  dropped  them.  The  crash  sent  Winchell 
from  his  chair. 

'Something  for  your  column,"  Buster  mut- 
tered. 

A  UGUST  Garbo  fashion  note  for 
■^^  Seymour's  attention.  The  Noisy 
One  buys  a  lot  of  her  duds  at  a 
little  shop  in  Beverly  Hills.  As  this 
is  written,  three  pairs  of  mannish 
grey  "walking  pants"  await  her  call. 
No  bane  got  dough,  Gret  old  girl? 

'  I  'HAT  old  rascal,  Guy  Kibbee,  such  a  sensa- 
tion  in  "The  Dark  Horse,"  furnished  at 
least  one  sector  of  Hollywood  with  the  loudest 
howl  of  any  recent  month. 

In  the  picture  Guy  is  forced  to  crawl  through 
a  barbed-wire  fence  clad  only  in  a  suit  of  full 
length  woolen  underwear.  At  a  crucial  mo- 
ment, with  the  cameras  grinding,  a  responsi- 
ble button  came  off! 

"Seamstress!  Seamstress!"  yowled  Kibbee, 
prancing  around  holding  himself  together. 

And  while  a  director  and  ten  electricians  lay 
on  the  ground,  screaming,  the  lady  with  the 
needle  was  found,  and  she  repaired  the  damage 
and  Guy's  shattered  nerves.

/"•ONE,  with  the  coming  of  the  mike,  are  the 
^-^clever  little  two  and  three-piece  orchestras 
that  whipped  the  emotions  of  many  a  Holly- 
wood movie  star  into  rare  bits  of  acting  before 
a  camera. 

All  except  the  two-piece  orchestra  of  one  of 
our  biggest  stars,  Richard  Dix.  Dix  still  main- 
tains the  same  two  musicians  he  employed 
years  ago.  A  pretty  Spanish  girl,  Dolores 
Ordocqui,  plays  the  violin  and  Eddie  Frazer 
drags  about  his  little  portable  organ  from  set 
to  set. 

And  while  Richard  tramps  majestically 
up  and  down  the  stage,  repeating  his  lines 
aloud  and  gesturing  wildly,  the  midget  band 
sends  out  the  thrilling  notes  of  "  St.  Louis 
Blues!" 

During  the  actual  shooting  of  the  scene,  the 
entire  orchestra  rests,  but  once  let  the  scene  be 
filmed,  and  "St.  Louis  Blues"  once  again  goes 
trilling  out  over  the  sound  stage. 

During  the  making  of  "Roar  of  the  Dra- 
gon," with  Chinese  children  scurrying  in  and 
out  of  the  sound  stage,  Richard  was  pacing 
madly  up  and  down  an  Oriental  garden  while 
otf  in  a  corner  the  faithful  little  orchestra 
wailed  out  that  hotsy-totsy  torch  song: 

"I  hate  to  see  that  evenin'  sun  go  down."

All  the  glory  of 

WHOLE  TOMATOES 


in  this 
famous 
Cocktail 


Among  all  Nature's  gifts,  none  is 
more  temptingly  delicious,  more 
heavily  laden  with  healthful  prop- 
erties than  the  ivhole  tomato.  And 
nowhere  is  its  glory  so  reflected 
as  in  original  College  Inn  Tomato 
Juice  Cocktail. 

It's  the  utmost  in  full-bodied, 
full-flavored  tomato  juice;  made 
from  the  finest  whole  tomatoes; 
hand  picked — and  then  blended 
into  an  invigorating,  spicy  cock- 
tail. It's  packed  by  the  new, 
exclusive  Hi-Vita  process;  pre- 
serves all  the  original  delicate 
flavor  and  vitamins. 

Always  put  up  in  glass  con- 
tainers— you  see  what's  inside — 
and  the  new  cap  is  amazingly 
easy  to  take  off. 

Insist  upon  original  College  Inn 
Tomato    Juice    Cocktail.    Com- 

f)ared  to  most  canned  juices  it's 
ike    fresh,    rich,    creamy,  whole 
cream  instead  of  thin,  watery  milk.

Charlie  Chaplin  believes  in  that  old  wheeze  about  doing  in  Rome  as  the 
Romans  do — but  whoever  said  anything  about  Japan?  Was  Charlie 
fussed  when  he  had  to  sit  cross-legged  when  he  was  invited  to  tea  in 
Japan — and  how  could  he  crook  his  little  finger  when  there  wasn't  any 
handle  on  the  cup?  Why,  he  even  has  his  shoes  off  and  doesn't  seem  any 
too  happy  about  it  either.    But  the  real  Japanese  thought  it  was  a  swell  joke 


XJILS  ASTHER  wanted  to  become  an  Amer- 
ican  citizen.  Red  tape  made  it  necessary 
for  him  to  go  to  a  foreign  country  and  re-enter 
this  one.  He  went  just  across  the  border  into 
Mexico. 

There  was  a  week  of  restless  waiting.  Then 
the  word  came.  He  dashed  into  the  United 
States.  Dashed  so  fast  that  two  miles  from  the 
border  he  was  arrested  for  speeding  and  put  in 
jail  for  several  hours,  until  his  identity  could 
be  proven. 

Beginning  his  citizenship  in  jail  was  not  ac- 
cording to  Xils'  expectations! 

n^HE  Bright  Young  Son  of  one  of 
Hollywood's  most  noted  directors 
nearly  gave  Pop  a  stroke  the  other 
night.  In  the  midst  of  dinner,  at 
which  guests  were  present,  Junior 
piped  up  with — 

"Dad,  what  kind  of  meat  is  this?" 
"Lamb,  my  boy,"  answered  un- 
suspecting pap.     "Why?" 

"I  wondered,"  said  the  precious 
child.  "You  said  you  were  having 
a  muttonhead  for  dinner!" 

A  RE  you  as  loyal  to  your  work  as  many 

movie  stars  are  to  theirs?    Do  you  work 

with  a  raging  temperature  and  broken  bones, 

for  days  and  weeks  at  a  time?    Do  I?    Don't 

be  silly! 

In  no  line  of  work  are  people  as  faithful  even 
to  giving  up  their  lives  for  their  labor. 

Robert  Williams  had  appendicitis.  He  knew 
it.    But  rather  than  hold  up  a  production  that 


meant  a  fortune  to  the  studio  and  possible 
stardom  for  him.  he  kept  on. 

You  know  the  result. 

Gary  Cooper  is  another  who  came  near  mak- 
ing the  supreme  sacrifice  for  his  work.  Eight 
pictures  in  twelve  months,  and  his  health 
completely  broke.  Another  month,  doctors 
say,  and  Gary  Cooper  would  have  followed 
Robert  Williams. 

Lila  Lee  and  Renee  Adoree  worked  them- 
selves into  a  sanitarium.  Lon  Chaney  is  an- 
other who  sacrificed  his  life  for  the  work  he 
loved. 

Joan  Crawford  danced  for  three  days  in 
"Grand  Hotel''  with  a  sprained  ankle.  Try  it 
sometime.  Gavin  Gordon  made  "Romance"' 
with  a  broken  collar  bone. 

Barbara  Stanwyck  worked  for  weeks  with 
an  injured  back,  and  had  to  be  carried  from 
set  to  set. 

Today,  studios  try  to  be  more  careful  of  an 
actor's  health. 

But  the  feverish  devotion  to  their  work  is 
hard  to  combat.  They  work  when  they're  well 
and  when  they're  broken  and  ill.  And  that's 
more  than  most  of  us  do. 

VJ7HY,  Connie! 

^V  It  seems  Miss  Bennett,  who  receives 
more  proposals  through  the  mail  than  any  ten 
other  movie  stars,  received  a  letter  from  an 
ardent  admirer. 

"I  hope  you  will  never  play  the  role  of  a 
good  girl  on  the  screen,"  it  read.  "I  take  so 
much  pleasure  in  seeing  you  go  wrong." 

She  does  do  it  beautifully,  at  that! 


"K /[OTHERS  of  America  are  largely  agog.  A 
^"■'■new  disease  called  "Tarzanitis"  seems  to 
be  sweeping  the  country. 

Doctors  are  being  called  on  to  treat  countless 
fractures,  sprains,  contusions  and  plain  bumps 
among  the  small  fry.  That's  because  every  kid 
in  the  land  is  playing  Tarzan — leaping  off 
garages,  hanging  from  trees  by  their  tails  and 
diving  headlong  into  plates  of  pea  soup.  The 
casualties  are  terrible. 

It's  always  that  way.  The  old  Doug  Fair- 
banks leaping  pictures  always  caused  an  epi- 
demic of  bruises  and  worse  among  the  small 
boys. 

If  Doug  could  leap  off  a  castle,  they  could 
at  least  jump  from  the  barn  roof. 

And  "Robin  Hood!"  How  many  little  sisters 
got  an  arrow  in  them  somewhere  while  big 
brother  was  just  playing  the  outlaw  of  Sher- 
wood Forest! 

"DARBARA    BEBE    LYON,    eight    months 

old,  was  allowed  to  visit  her  father  on  the 
set  the  other  day. 

But  business  is  business,  so  papa  Ben  had  to 
get  on  with  his  work,  daughter  looking  on. 

Microphone  was  swung  into  place,  camera 
set.    A  tense  scene.    Rapid  fire  of  dialogue. 

A  moment  of  silence.  And  Miss  Barbara 
Bebe,  daughter  of  efficient  scene-snatchers, 
took  advantage  of  it  to  express  her  approval  of 
her  father's  work  in  her  own  language. 

Of  course  the  scene  was  ruined.  But  was 
father  nettled?    Not  atall.    Not  atall. 

He  rushed  over  to  the  sound  man. 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  August,  1932 

"Isn't  that  wonderful?  It's  the  first  time 
her  voice  was  ever  recorded.  How  did  it 
sound? " 

The  cost  of  the  shot  was  estimated  at  about 
$500.    Did  papa  offer  to  pay  for  it? 

"What?  Me  pay  for  the  scene?  You  should 
pay  me  for  the  record  of  her  voice." 

The  beginning  of  Miss  Lyon's  career  in  the 
talkies?

COMEBODY  thought  it  would  be  a  good 
idea  to  find  out  what  stars  are  popular  in  the 
South  American  countries.  What  would  be 
your  guess?  Lupe,  maybe,  eh?  Or  Del  Rio? 
Guess  again.  None  other  than  the  Swedish 
Garbo  herself  remains  the  favorite  of  the 
Latins.  Ramon  Novarro  was  the  only  Latin 
in  which  the  South  Americans  displayed  more 
than  average  interest.  But  Chevalier.  That 
Maurice.  Whoops,  my  dear.  They  go  Chevalier 
crazy. 

And  the  favorite  comedians?  Laurel  and 
Hardy.  That  pitiful  whimpering  of  Stan's  is 
sending  the  South  Americans  into  hysterics. 

V\  THEN  the  Junior  Leaguers  held  their  na- 
tional  convention  in  Los  Angeles  recently, 
guess  what  movie  sheik  almost  stopped  the 
show?  The  girls  went  for  him  in  such  a  way 
that  he  was  unable  to  utter  a  word  of  his 
speech  for  five  minutes. 

Did  I  hear  you  say  Gable?  Nope — it  was 
good  old  Wally  Beery  himself!  Ah  there, 
Wally!

"This  part  requires  a  lot  of  strong  emotional  power, 
Jake — give  'em  all  you've  got" 


Cal   York's   Monthly    Broadcast    from   Hollywood 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  109  ] 


CPEAKING  of  Barbara  and  Frank  Fay, 
^here's  tin.-  low-down  on  this  independence  of 
the  Stanwyck  gal. 

h'>  the  truth  that  she  thinks  more  of  Frank 
than  careers,  fortunes,  and  so  on.  She  is  simply 
old-fashionedly  mad  about  her  husband.  And 
she  want>  any  studio  with  which  she  is  con- 
nected to  hire  her  husband. 

And  when  he's  on  the  lot,  getting  a  chance, 
she's  perfectly  happy. 

She's  as  nuek  as  a  lamb,  and  does  what  any- 
one asks  her. 

But  when  a  studio  won't  hire  Frank,  whom 
she  honestly  considers  the  world's  greatest 
actor,  she's  mad.  She  hates  them  for  wanting 
her  and  not  him. 

Hollywood  calls  her  temperamental.  Exec- 
utives, who  aren't  used  to  wives  who  put  a 
husband's  career  first,  call  her  crazy.  I  think 
she's  a  breath  of  fresh  air  in  this  egotistical, 
self-centered  city. 

FMSAPPOINTMENT  in  Hollywood  means 
"^as  much  to  the  rich  as  the  poor. 

Take  the  case  of  Margaret  Perry,  daughter 
of  Antoinette  Perry,  actress  and  directress  of 
plays.  Margaret  is  eighteen  and  wealthy. 
When  she's  twenty-one  she  comes  into  an  inde- 
pendent fortune. 

She  brought  to  Hollywood  the  maid  who 
has  cared  for  her  since  she  was  a  baby,  and  an 
aunt  to  chaperone  her. 

You'd  think  a  kid  with  a  golden  spoon  like 
that  wouldn't  let  this  business  upset  her.  But 
when  she  read  the  review  of  her  only  picture, 
"New  Morals  For  Old"  in  a  Hollywood  trade 


Here's  China's  contribution  to  the  cinema,  and  if  that  most  dramatic 
young  woman  on  Richard  Dix's  right  knee  isn't  a  second  Anna  May  Wong 
in  the  making  we'll  eat  our  hat  and  a  couple  of  reels  of  film.  These  kids, 
brought  from  Los  Angeles'  Chinatown,  appear  with  Richard  in  "Roar  of 
the  Dragon,"  and  if  you  asked  one  of  them  about  his  "vellee  honorable 
ancestors,"  he'd  probably  answer,  "Oh  you  mean  grandpop.     He's  okay"

for  her  polka  dotted  frock.  She  merely  buttons  or  unbuttons  long  sleeves 
that  look  like  gauntlets.  The  sleeves  removed,  reveal  a  short  sleeve 
attractively  cuffed  in  lace.    Tricky,  what? 


paper  the  morning  following  the  preview,  she 
took  the  next  train  for  Denver.  Rushed  home 
to  mamma  and  the  folk  who  love  her  in  spite 
of  the  fact  that  a  naughty  reviewer  said  she 
was  a  very  bad  actress. 

A  Xew  York  writer  said  she  ran  away  from  a 
boy  friend.  'Taint  so.  She  was  too  well 
chaperoned  during  her  short  stay  in  Holly- 
wood to  get  her  heart  involved.  She  ran  away 
from  professional  heartbreak.  For,  in  spite  of 
the  gold  spoon,  her  one  ambition  has  been  to 
become  a  Xorma  Shearer. 

Margaret  shouldn't  base  her  all  on  one  re- 
viewer. 

Photoplay  thought  she  did  well  for  a  new- 
comer. And  her  second  might  have  proved  a 
sensation.    Who  knows? 

T^IRECTOR  Mervyn  Le  Roy  went 
-'-'to  see  "Grand  Hotel."  When 
he  came  out,  he  turned  to  girl-friend 
Ginger  Rogers  with:  "The  title 
should  have  been  'Cramped  Hotel.' 
Did  you  ever  see  so  many  actors 
trying  to  get  into  a  camera  at  one 
time?" 

f^RF.TA  GARBO  attended  the  preview  of 
^J"As  You  Desire  Me"'  with  her  friend, 
Mercedes  D'Acosta. 

And  that,  chums,  is  news  in  Hollywood! 

Only  one  person  save  those  in  the  preview 
section  knew  Garbo  was  in  the  house.  That 
was  a  small  boy  who  sat  across  the  aisle.  When 
she  left,  he  streaked  after  her. 

Xo — she  didn't  scrawl  in  his  autograph 
album.  That  would  have  been  simply  TOO 
sensational.  But  the  kid  did  see  Garbo,  which 
is  more  than  most  of  this  starving  world  does! 


A  COUPLE  of  good  Hollywood  husbands 
■*■      are  on  the  loose ! 

Chartering  the  Cecil  B.  De  Mille  yacht, 
Doug  Fairbanks,  Jr.  and  Robert  Montgomery 
have  sailed  away  on  a  fishing  trip  through 
Mexican  waters. 

Anxious  to  gather  proper  atmosphere  for 
"Revolt,"  his  next  picture  with  a  Russian 
background,  Doug  attended  the  Russian  Art 
Club  the  night  before  he  and  Bob  sailed  and 
in  a  truly  Fairbanks  manner,  invited  the  entire 
Russian  orchestra  to  join  them. 

Three  days  later  Doug  wired  in  from  the 
briny  deep — "Sending  back  the  Russians. 
They  got  seasick  on  me." 

Mrs.  Montgomery  is  visiting  in  New  York 
and  Joan  Crawford,  Doug's  wife,  is  off  on  loca- 
tion making  "Rain." 

A  ND  all  the  time  we  thought  we  were  so- 
ciety!  But  just  read  those  Hollywood 
papers  and  see  where  movie  stars  stand  among 
the  "400"  of  Beverly  Hills!  Society  parties 
and  luncheons  there  are  galore,  and  not  a 
movie  name  among  them.  Not  even  a  Pick- 
ford!  There  is  no  place  in  the  world  as 
snobbish  in  its  exclusiveness  as  Beverly  Hills. 

One  might  live  next  door  to  a  famous  movie 
star,  but  one  doesn't  invite  one's  neighbors  to 
one's  party.  Not  if  Beverly  Hills  society  knows 
it,  he  doesn't. 

And  it  might  interest  you  to  know  that  there 
are  two  "sets"  in  that  exclusive  society. 

One  who  will  in  a  generous  moment,  accept 
an  invitation  to  a  film  star's  home,  and  those 
who  never  do.  And  never  will,  according  to 
Cholly  Angelo,  society  reporter. 

But  when  one  of  New  York's  blueblooded 
''400"  visits  the  land  of  sunshine  and  oranges, 
they  make  a  bee  line  for  Mary  Pickford  or 
Marion  Davies  and  the  hotsy-totsy  of  Beverly 
Hills  can  chew  their  nails  all  they  want. 

We're  a  curiosity  to  New  York,  but  to 
Beverly  Hills  we're  just  "those  people  next 
door."    We  don't  count  it  seems. 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  August,  1932 

HpALK  about  economy  in  the  movies! 

A  large  part  of  "Tiger  Shark,"  Eddie 
Robinson's  latest,  is  being  filmed  at  sea.  The 
picture  shows  the  catching,  transportation  and 
unloading  of  tuna  fish. 

Warner  Brothers  hired  a  tuna  boat  for  the 
purpose,  and  then  instructed  the  men  to 
actually  catch  enough  fish  to  pay  for  the  rental 
of  the  boat. 

And  they  did!  They  stayed  out  until  they 
had  85  tons,  which  they  sold  to  a  cannery  and 
made  expenses. 

In  the  old  days — what  a  feed  for  the  pelicans! 

"LTOLLYWOOD  has  gone  nuts  on 
cottage  cheese!  One  restaurant 
serves  it  four  ways.  You  can  use  it 
with  sour  cream,  with  chives  or  in  the 
form  of  a  salad.  It's  supposed  to  be 
reducing — but  the  joke  is,  it's  really 
fattening! 

/^ARBO'S  dressing  room  is  separated  from 
^^Joan  Crawford's  by  only  a  phone  booth. 
Though  the  ladies  never  meet,  sounds  are 
audible  from  one  to't  other. 

Greta's  colored  Alma  and  Joan's  sepia  Alice 
have  become  quite  pally,  lately.  Garbo 
watched  the  friendship  blossom  without  com- 
ment. Then,  as  she  and  Alma  were  descending 
the  stairs  one  day,  they  came  face  to  face  with 
Alice. 

Garbo  stopped  dead. 

"Alma,  is  dis  Alice?"  she  asked. 

"Yes'm,"  replied  Alma,  wondering  if  she 
were  in  for  a  scolding  for  occasional  gossip- 
sessions. 

Greta  turned  loose  one  of  her  now-and-then 
million-candle-power  smiles. 

"Hello,  Alice!"  she  said,  while  Alice  seemed 
in  a  fainting  condition. 

This  is  sort  of  a  silly  story,  after  all.  "Hello, 
Alice!"  What's  that?  Just  forget  I  ever 
brought  it  up.

That  ^Second  Valentino"  Curse 


CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  2/ 


an  actor  almost  spontaneously — and  like 
Jimmy,  he  scored  his  lirM  smash  success  in  the 
rule  of  a  slit-eyed,  cool-nerved  gangman. 

Raft  lt-f t  school  in  the  seventh  grade,  by 
special  request. 

Hi  boxed  some.  Then  he  found  himself, 
somehow,  dancing  professionally  at  the  Man- 
hattan Casino. 

There  was  no  such  word  as  "gigolo"  then, 
with  its  nastier  implications. 

Georgie,  throughout  his  Broadway  club  and 
cafe  career,  was  a  "dancing  partner."  It  was 
just  a  job,  like  juggling  trays — only  a  little 
pleasanter. 

He  had  plenty  of  partners,  for  it  was  in  the 
time  of  the  Valentino  madness,  and  that  fatal 
resemblance  attracted  wide  attention. 

Broadway  night-life  knew  him  well.  In 
1927  he  worked  for  Texas  Guinan,  whose  cry 
of  "Hello,  sucker!"  has  been  heard  'round  the 
world. 

Stepping  into  the  spotlight  nightly,  he 
hurled  himself  into  a  hot  dance. 

Then  he  retired  to  a  quiet  corner  of  Tex's 
old  "300  Club"  and  sat  quietly  with  the  boys. 
Tex  gave  him  a  pair  of  gold-plated  garters, 
lie  still  wears  'em. 

THE  Guinan  chorus  girls  like  Geortrie — 
called  him  "The  Old  Black  Snake."  They 
still  do. 

The  boys'  pet  name  for  him  is  "Jig-ie." 
Even  my  feeble  brain  figures  that  as  a  diminu- 
tive of  "gigolo." 

The  scene  changes — 1927  to  1932.  It  is 
the  opening  night  of  a  new  Texas  Guinan 
club. 

Again   Raft  is  sitting    in    the   place. 

But  this  time,  when  the  spotlight  hits  him, 


Georgie  just  gets  up  and  takes  a  bow  or  two. 
lor  he  is  the  new  movie  wow — the  panic  of 
"Scarface" — the  lad  all  the  girls  are  moan- 
ing  about.  That's  Broadway  fame — it's  the 
knighthood  of  night  life! 

What  things  tan  happen  to  a  dancing  boy 
in  a  few  years! 

f~^  EORGIE  is  a  man's  man,  for  all  his  slick 
^Jgood  looks,  slim  figure,  nifty  clothes.  He 
likes  to  gather  with  "the  boys."  He  knows 
most  of  the  figures  in  the  sport  world.  His  pal 
is  Jimmie  ("Schnozzle")  Durante.  He  is  a 
free  cusser  when  roused,  and  can  use  his  fists 
for  something  beside  scooping  food.  In  short,  a 
very  handy  guy  to  have  on  your  side  in  a  dis- 
pute. 

His  flicker  shot  is  another  movie  miracle — 
F.  O.  B.  Hollywood! 

He  was  out  there  "just  looking  around" — 
palling  with  the  Xew  York  crowd,  Durante, 
and  that  lot. 

Director  Rowland  Brown  saw  him  in  the 
Brown  Derby  one  night.  "I  want  a  menace 
with  sex  appeal,"  said  Brown  to  Raft.  "You're 
it!" 

The  next  morning  he  went  to  work  in  "Quick 
-Millions." 

Again  the  quick  eye  of  a  director  had  started 
a  nobody  on  the  road  to  being  plenty  some- 
body! 

"Dancers  in  the  Dark"  followed,  with 
Georgie  giving  Miriam  Hopkins  and  Jack  Oakie 
stiff  competition. 

The  stage  was  set  for  his  "Scarface" 
triumph. 

And  when  it  came,  it  was  a  roar! 

Not  long  ago  I  attended  a  showing  of  "  Scar- 
face "  at  the  famous  Rialto  Theater,  Xew  York. 


The  picture  ended,  and  a  spotlight  hit  the 
stage. 

Into  it  stepped  George  Raft,  for  a  bow. 

Just  a  few  years  before  he  had  worked  in 
a  presentation  on  that  very  stage,  for  a  few 
dollars  a  night! 

Heigho,  what  a  world  when  the  breaks  are 
with  you! 

A  Strom;,  silent  boy,  this  Raft — not  one  to 
monkey  with. 

He  lives  inconspicuously  in  Hollywood,  with 
a  pal. 

He  speaks  some  Italian  and  fluent  Broadway 
American. 

He  knows  everyone  there  is  to  know  in  Xew 
York  night  life,  high  and  low,  harmless  and 
dangerous.  He  has  potent  friends  who  wish 
him  well. 

Oh,  he'll  get  on,  Georgie  will!  He  laughs 
off  the  old  "Second  Yalentino"  hoodoo,  that 
has  inflated  so  many  skulls  and  dumped  over 
so  many  careers,  since  he  toiled  as  a  dancing 
boy  for  a  few  pence. 

TS  "Scarface"  to  be  a  second  "Miracle  Man" 
-'•as  a  star-maker?  Will  it  do  for  Paul  Muni, 
Ann  Dvorak  and  Georgie  Raft  what  its  pred- 
ecessor did  for  Meighan,  Compson  and  Cha- 
ney?  I,  for  one,  shouldn't  be  a  bit  startled  if 
it  did! 

Whatever  happens,  olive-skinned  Georgie 
Raft  is  up  there,  in  there,  doing  mighty  fine. 
He'll  play  anything,  do  anything,  act  anything 
the  bosses  want. 

For  he's  had  a  taste  of  film  fame — and  it's 
sweet  upon  his  palate. 

And  don't  call  him  a  "second  Rudy" — and 
don't  do  anything  to  him  that  isn't  nice!  For 
he  has  a  cold  and  meaningful  eye! 


Have  You  That  ^Desk-Chair  Spread"?

in  your  mouth,  actually  chewing  it.  This 
makes  it  mix  with  the  natural  saliva  and  di- 
gests easily. 

Many  women  have  told  me  that  diets  made 
them  feel  weak  on  account  of  the  effect  on 
their  nerves. 

You  won't  feel  weak  on  my  diet,  I'll  guar- 
antee you  that! 

And  women  and  girls  of  any  age  can  take  my 
diet,  my  exercices  and  my  prescribed  number 
of  hours  sleep. 

And  now  a  word  to  you  girls  who  want  to 
put  on  weight  in  spots — on  the  back,  the  arms, 
the  neck. 

There  is  but  one  way  to  do  that. 

Get  plump  all  over  and  then  take  off  the 
surplus  weight  in  spots. 

That's  what  Connie  Bennett  had  to  do,  you 
know. 

1  worked  to  put  a  little  more  weight  all  over 
her  and  then  took  off  the  parts  that  weren't 
necessary. 

For  anything  can  be  done.  Flesh  can  be 
squeezed  and  slapped  away. 

Even  bow  legs  can  be  made  to  look  less 
bowed. 

I  did  that  for  one  very  famous  star. 

You  can  do  it,  too,  by  taking  olf  all  the  flesh 
on  the  outside  of  the  legs  and  leaving  flesh  on 
the  inside. 

But  right  now  I  might  as  well  tell  you  that 
I  can't  change  bone  formation  and  if  you  have 
bow-legs  all  you  can  do  is  camouflage  them  as 
I've  explained.  A  girl  told  me  she  had  a 
prominent  jaw  line  and  flesh  along  it.  She  can 
mould  otf  that  flesh,  but  she  can't  change  the 
jaw  bone. 


And  another  begs  to  know  what  to  do  for  a 
large  head.  Did  you  ever  hear  anything  so 
silly? 

Does  she  think  I  can  tell  her  how  to  reduce 
the  skull? 

What  she  can  do  is  to  choose  her  clothes 
cleverly  and  wear  her  hair  smartly  so  that  the 
head  will  not  look  as  prominent  as  it  is. 

You  must  work  out  your  own  salvation  about 
lots  of  things. 

If  one  side  of  your  back  is  larger  than  the 
other  or  one  hip  higher,  you  must  reduce  the 
flesh  on  the  large  side — a  camouflaging  process 
again. 

But  you  can  correct  a  sway  back.  The  rea- 
son anyone  has  a  sway  back  is  because  of 
wrong  posture  and  because  the  niuscles  of  the 
abdomen  are  not  strong  enough. 

Therefore,  take  my  abdominal  exercises. 
Hold  the  abdomen  in  and  strengthen  those 
muscles. 

And  now,  don't  let  me  hear  any  more  of 
you  all-day-sitters  complaining  about  that 
"desk-chair  spread." 

Get  busy  and  take  it  off.  It  can  be  done. 
I  know  it  as  well  as  I  know  my  name  is  Sylvia. 

Get  to  work,  girls.  Snap  out  of  your  in- 
dolent ways! 

Ami  watch  out  for  next  month — I've  got  a 
couple  ot  surprises  for  you  and  a  lot  of  brand- 
new  ways  of  making  yourselves  lovely.

Will  Clark  Gable  Last? 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  67 


these  concessions  is,  I  believe,  his  marriage 
And  we  cannot  blame  him  when  the  talk  of 
divorce  made  him  fearful  at  this  time.  Now 
he  and  Mrs.  Gable  are  re-united. 

Here's  another  strange  thing  that  gives  you 
a  tip-off  on  Gable's  character. 

When  he  first  came  to  Hollywood  he  was 
indifferent  to  all  forms  of  so-called  psychic 
phenomena. 

And  when  the  subject  was  mentioned — it  is 
a  very  vital  part  of  Hollywood  conversation 
— his  laconic  answer  was,  "Rot!" 

But  accidentally  he  met  a  psychic  who  gave 
him  a  reading,  and  since  then  he  has  sought 
out  the  psychics  several  times,  always  trying 
to  discover  "How  long  will  this  success  of 
mine  last?" 

After  conferring  with  Clark  more  than  once, 
a  certain  psychic  wrote  a  story  about  him, 
several  paragraphs  of  which  I  should  like  to 
quote  for  you. 

Here  they  are: 

CLARK  GABLE  believes  that  his  fame  was 
a  freak  of  fate.  He  will  tell  you  that  his 
success  is  accidental.  But  this  does  not  de- 
ceive a  psychic,  since  Gable  is  what  he  has 
made  himself. 

"By  hard  study  and  diligence  he  has  made 
himself  over — changed  the  quality  of  his  voice, 
learned  his  best  points. 

"The  help  he  has  received  along  the  way 
has  not  been  accidental  either.  If  his  romances 
have  contributed  to  his  success,  that  has  not 
bothered  Gable.  And  much  credit  must  be 
given  to  this  clear-minded  young  man  who  be- 
came tired  of  poverty  and  longed  for  some  of 
the  luxury  that  he  knew  could  be  his  by  dint 
of  hard  work. 

"Clark,  on  the  screen,  plays  the  role  of 
lover,  but  because  he  lacks  the  tenderness  that 
is  essential  if  a  man  be  permanently  fascinat- 


ing to  a  woman,  he  would  disappoint  the  aver- 
age woman. 

"He  is  fundamentally  selfish.  A  well  regu- 
lated home  and  children  cannot  appeal  to 
him,  since  his  nature  demands  travel,  change, 
excitement — anything  to  appease  the  in- 
satiable longing  for  the  color  of  life  that  is  so 
closely  identified  with  his  ego. 

"If  he  doesn't  last  on  the  screen  as  long  a 
time  as  he  has  set  for  himself — his  disappoint- 
ment  will   be   terrific. 

"A  more  intellectual  person  would  not  have 
put  everything  into  a  career,  but  would  have 
held  something  back  in  case  the  career  did  not 
pan  out. 

"But  Clark  in  his  eagerness  to  succeed  and 
to  acquire  independence,  has  burnt  all  his 
bridges  behind  him. 

"He  has  wanted  so  ardently  to  prove  him- 
self to  himself,  that  he  has  given  all  his 
vitality  to  his  career.  If  the  career  lasts  until 
he  is  sure  of  himself  he  will  be  content  to 
retire  with  the  tidy  sum  he  has  made  by  his 
screen  work." 

YOU  may  or  may  not  believe  the  psychic. 
But  this  analysis  comes  so  close  to  Clark's 
real  character  as  I  know  it  that  I  find  much 
food  for  thought  in  it. 

I  doubt  if  he  can  change  any  more  than  he 
has — either  as  an  actual  person  or  a  screen 
type. 

Therefore  I  repeat  that  he  will  last  just  as 
long  as  women  accept  him  as  he  is  and  just 
as  long  as  the  film  companies  give  him  typical 
Clark  Gable  roles. 

When  the  powers  that  be  try  to  make  him 
versatile  and  allow  him  to  step  out  of  the 
character  that  he  has  created,  his  days  will  be 
over.

You  Can't  Live  on  Promises 


I  (  o.n  iimi.I)  PSOll  PACE  77 


get  back  to  the  home  town.  The  fact  (hey 
were  slran<leil  didn't  matter  so  ir.uch  as  the 
blow  of  being  let  down  so  cruelly,  by  a  friend. 

Si )  that's  the  first  lesson  you  must  learn,  if 
you  hope  to  tackle  Hollywood.  Don't  ever 
on  indefinite  promises.  Not  even  from 
higher  ups.    Especially  not  from  higher  ups. 

(  th,  it  doesn't  always  happen.  Hut  too  often 
to  take  a  chance.  And  the  friend  may  not  be 
able  to  help  you.  It's  just  the  way  things  are 
in  Hollywood. 

Then,  don't  come  without  a  contract  or  a 
big  chance  of  one.  And  don't,  please,  expect 
options  to  be  taken  up.  They  seldom  are,  un- 
less you  are  one  of  those  once-in-every-ten- 
year  sensations,  or  a  very  famous  actor  indeed. 
Hut  suppose  you  do  get  a  bono,  fide  contract. 
He  prepared  to  find  the  catch.  There's  sure  to 
be  one  in  it. 

No,  I'm  not  just  trying  ,to  be  pessimistic. 
I've  seen  this  happen  not  once,  or  ten  limes, 
but  dozens  of  times. 

Wait  till  I  tell  you  of  Chester  Morris'  expe- 
rience with  contracts.  He  went  back  to  New 
York  after  the  De  Mille  episode  and  resumed 
his  career  on  the  stage.  He  was  going  good, 
had  a  contract  with  Woods,  had  married  lovely 
little  Sue  Kilborn,  and  all  was  hunky-dory. 

And  then  came  another  Hollywood  come-on. 
The  chance  to  play  in  "  Alibi. "  United  Artists 
dangled  a  contract  before  Chet's  eyes. 

A  contract.  Was  that  something?  He  broke 
his  New  York  contract  and  came  to  Hollywood 
again.  He  made  one  picture,  "Alibi,"  on  that 
contract.  It  took  three  months.  For  the  rest 
of  the  time  he  sat  around  lonely,  ignored,  for- 
gotten, and  at  the  end  of  three  months  had  his 
great  big,  good-looking  contract  snatched  from 
under  his  nose.  He  nearly  starved  before  he 
could  get  another  one. 

So  don't  get  contract-conscious.  It  doesn't 
mean  much  in  Hollywood.  Of  course,  Chester 
signed  another,  one  he  felt  sure  was  right  this 


time.  Hut  it  kept  him  off  the  screen  for  fifteen 
months,  while  story  after  story  was  turned 
down  as  not  suitable  for  Chester.  Mind,  I 
ter  doesn't  say  anything  about  it.  Not  Ches- 
ter. Hut  you're  no  dumbbell.  You  know  what 
fifteen  months  off  the  screen  means  to  an  actor 
in  Hollywood.  And  what  a  comeback  in  a 
weak  picture  like  "Cock  o'  the  Air"  can  mean. 

Expect  those  things,  I'm  telling  you.  You 
are  never  sitting  too  pretty  in  Hollywood. 
There  is  a  pin  in  every  cushion.  Many  a  young 
man  with  a  contract  has  gone  back  to  where 
he  came  from,  a  sadder  and  wiser  lad. 

Now  if  you  are  one  of  those  determined  per- 
sons who  decide  to  come  on  promises,  or  cute 
little  contracts  all  wrapped  in  cellophane  and 
pink  ribbon,  at  least  bring  plenty  of  extra 
cash  to  tide  you  over  several  years  of  disap- 
pointments. 

Chester  Morris,  with  Sue  and  a  brand-new 
baby,  can  tell  you  a  few  things  about  that. 

The  icy  fear  around  the  heart  when  the  door 
bell  rings.  Another  tradesman  to  combat.. 
The  milkman,  to  collect.  There  is  nothing  like 
it  to  tear  down  the  morale. 

And  over  three-fourths  of  Hollywood  are 
living  in  the  icy  clutches  of  fear  and  bluff,  to- 
day. Remember  that,  young  man  —  and 
young  woman. 

r\JOW,  we'll  surmise  you're  here  and  you're 
-1-^  making  money.  Then  for  heaven's  sake,  I 
beg  you,  go  to  see  Sue  and  Chester  Morris  in 
their  home  and  absorb  some  of  their  normalcy. 
Oh,  it's  grand  to  be  exotic;  to  be  hot  and  sexy 
and  talked  about.  But  if  you  want  to  stay 
awhile,  don't  be. 

If  you  have  a  family,  say  so.  The  way 
Chester  Morris  loves  his  brings  him  more  praise 
and  notice  than  any  ten  violent  affairs  with 
violent  people. 

The  other  evening  two  insurance  men  came 
to  the  Morris  home  on  business.  Sue  was  sew- 
ing by  the  fire.    Chester  had  his  slippered  feet 


higher  than  his  head,  reading  away.  Brooks, 
the  boy,  sat  on  the  floor  with  a  toy  train.  The 
baby  was  propped  up  on  a  chair  with  pillows, 
busy  with  a  rubber  doll. 

The  men  stared  and  gasped.  "Why-er — 
that  is — good  evening, "  they  said.  It  happens 
these  same  men  had  come  straight  from  the 
home  of  a  famous  and  much  written  about 
star.  Things  happened  at  that  star's  home 
that  those  two  matter-of  fact  business  men  will 
never  forget. 

TTIE  next  day,  at  a  large  business  luncheon, 
■*-  stories  of  the  two  homes  were  told,  hun- 
dreds of  families  heard  it  by  nightfall.  Chester 
Morns'  stock  went  up  one  hundred  per  cent 
in  thousands  of  homes,  before  the  week  was 
over. 

Respectability  pays.  And  don't  let  anyone 
try  to  tell  you  differently. 

Living  simply  is  a  good  idea,  too. 

Right  here  I'll  wager  you  five  dollars  that 
Chester  and  Sue  Morris  live  on  less  than  any 
Hollywood  folks  drawing  one-fifth  his  salary. 
You  would  shriek  to  high  heavens,  if  you  knew. 
Chester  is  having  his  shekels  stored  away  for 
him.    He  isn't  even  touching  them  himself. 

Experience?  Eor  heaven's  sake  haven't  I 
mentioned  that  yet?  How  much,  you  ask, 
does  this  Chet  Morris  think  you  need,  to  tackle 
Hollywood? 

It's  simple  and  easy.  Not  over  ten  good 
years  on  any  stage,  with  little  tank  town  tours 
in  between. .  In  Texas.  In  Iowa.  With  cold 
rooms,  cold  beds  and  colder  receptions.  Four 
years  of  vaudeville.  Five  years  on  Broadway, 
say.  That's  what  Chester  Morris  had  behind 
Chick  Williams  in  "Alibi."  You  didn't  think 
that  performance  just  happened,  did  you?  Or 
the  boy  in  "The  Big  House "?  Or  the  crook  in 
"The  Miracle  Man  ?  Years  and  years  of  hard 
work  stand  behind  those  roles,  and  also  the  one 
he  plays  with  Jean  Harlow  in  "Red  Headed 
Woman,"  which  you'll  see  soon. 


Would  You  Believe  It?

things.  For  where  else  was  he?  But  you  know 
and  I  know  about  the  Jordan  sitting  room. 
Hollywood  doesn't. 

What  certain  young  leading  man  went  to  a 
friend  of  Dorothy's  for  advice.  "Is  there  a 
chance  for  me?"  Joel  McCrea  asked.  This 
after  Dorothy  had  played  with  Joel  in  "The 
Lost  Squadron." 

"She's  the  type  of  girl  I've  always  liked  and 
wanted  to  know."  And  all  the  time  we 
thought  it  was  the  Bennett  type.  See.  We 
told  you.  Here  is  a  little  brown  wren  at  work. 
Tsk,  tsk,  tsk.  And  all  the  time  we  were 
dolling  up  in  white  satin  and  suntan  make-up, 
Hollywood  bachelors  were  following  a  little 
blue  sash. 

And  never  quite  catching  up. 

"COR  the  truth  of  the  matter  is.  Dorothy  isn't 
*-  bothered — much.  Beneath  the  flowered  dim- 
ity lives  a  determined,  strong-willed  young 
lady.  Make  no  mistake  about  that.  She  has 
our  ambition.  To  get  on.  On  her  own.  And  try, 
you  with  that  fetching  mustache,  you  with 
those  millions,  you  with  your  charm,  to  swerve 
her  just  one  inch  from  that  goal.    Try. 

For  behind  that  quaint  little  "down  South" 
accent,  those  appealing  little  ways  that  are  all 
a  real  and  natural  part  of  Dorothy,  lives  a 
clear  thinking,  cool-headed  young  woman. 
Yes  ma'm. 

Getting   all    that   Hollywood   has   to  give. 


Without  particularly  trying  or  meaning  to. 
Or  lifting  a  little  finger  to  do  so. 

Lady,  keep  down  that  little  finger. 

Down  in  Clarksville,  Tennessee,  Dot  de- 
cided to  go  to  New  York  to  be  an  actress.  Of 
course,  thousands  of  girls  all  over  Tennessee 
and  Ohio  and  Iowa,  too,  make  up  their  minds 
sometime  to  go  to  New  Yrork  to  be  actresses. 

Only  Dorothy  did. 

Of  course  her  father,  a  prosperous  merchant, 
was  against  it  one  hundred  per  cent.  But 
mother  said,  "I  have  a  little  money  saved  up." 
Which  will  bring  a  sting  of  tears  to  the  eyes 
of  many  a  successful  man  and  woman  who 
remember  back  to  those  other  mothers  who 
"had  a  little  money  saved  up." 

So  Dorothy  became  a  chorus  girl  and  then 
on  to  a  bit  in  "Treasure  Girl"  in  New  York. 
And  the  star  of  the  show,  Ona  Munson,  took 
one  look  at  little  Miss  Jordan  and  promptly 
wore  herself  to  a  shadow  doing  things  for 
that  sweet  little  lamb.  And  stars  in  New  York 
shows  don't  usually  fret  themselves  over  little 
chorus  girls.  But — and  get  this— Ona  even 
dragged  out  her  manager  to  see  what  she  had 
found  in  the  second  act.  And  the  manager, 
well,  he  practically  worked  himself  into  a 
fever  doing  things  for  that  nice  little  thing. 
He  just  got  her  a  contract  with  Fox,  that's  all 
he  did. 

But  before  she  got  here,  there's  one  little 
thing  that  happened  to  Dorothy  that  no  one 


ever  knew  before.  Not  even  her  mother.  So 
don't  let  on. 

Just  before  Christmas  her  show  closed.  Dor- 
othy had  enough  money  saved  to  go  home  for 
Christmas  but  she  did  want  a  little  extra  to 
buy  gifts.  So — and  here's  that  do-or-die  spirit 
Hollywood  will  never  lick — she  stood  in  line 
with  250  other  people  who  were  after  those 
seventeen  open  jobs  at  Wanamaker's  depart- 
ment store. 

Right  in  line.  A  New  York  show  girl.  And 
waited  and  waited. 

And  one  of  those  efficient  looking  persons 
walked  down  that  waiting  line  announcing  that 
the  jobs  were  filled,  when  suddenly  those  efficient 
eyes  fell  on  Dorothy.  Just  standing  there.  .All 
by  herself.  Well,  anyway,  they  created  a  job 
for  Miss  Jordan. 

Have  I  tried  to  tell  you?    Have  I? 

UP  in  the  children's  umbrellas  went  Dor- 
othy. Plaid  silk  umbrellas.  And  there  the 
nice  old  gray-haired  floorwalker  spied  Dorothy 
in  her  especially  created  job,  and  was  he 
burned?  The  idea  of  putting  a  nice  little  thing 
like  that  in  the  umbrellas  where  the  commis- 
sions didn't  amount  to  that.  He  snapped  a 
mean  finger,  he  did.  And  made  the  red-head  in 
the  boy's  necktie  and  penknife  sets  move  over 
to  the  umbrellas  and  Dorothy  was  moved  to 
the  necktie  and  penknife  sets  where  the  com- 
missions ran  up.    Like  a  temperature. 


But  while  the  Wanamaker  thing  was  in  full 
bloom,  Dot's  friends  were  madly  searching  the 
city  to  tell  her  that  for  the  love  of  Pete,  Fox 
had  seen  a  test  of  her  and  wanted  her. 

So  Dorothy  saw  the  Fox  people,  who  gave 
her  three  hours  to  catch  a  train.  But  you  see, 
they  just  didn't  know  Dorothy. 

For  one  hour  later,  she  left  that  office  with 
a  contract,  a  two- weeks  stopover  at  Clarksville, 
and  well — you  just  name  anything  offhand.  It 
was  Dorothy's. 

And  she  arrived  in  Hollywood,  as  I  told  you, 
and  no  one  cared  or  looked  twice. 

LATER,  over  at  United  Artists,  Mary  Pick- 
ford  was  getting  ready  for  "The  Taming  of 
the  Shrew." 

So  Dorothy  took  herself  to  the  studio  and 
sat  in  the  casting  office  for  hours.  Days, 
practically. 

One  day  a  man  came  rushing  in  and  spied 
Dorothy.  "Would  you  mind  trying  on  this 
dress  for  me?"  he  asked. 

"Glad  to,"  Dorothy  replied  and  tried  on 
Mary's  dress. 

"Maybe  I  can  do  something  for  you  some- 
time," the  wardrobe  man  said,  and  thanked 
her. 

"Oh,  you  can,"  backward  little  Dorothy 
said.  "You  can  get  me  to  Sam  Taylor,  the 
director.    I  want  to  act  in  this  picture. " 

And  she  did.  You  just  know  she  did.  If 
you  know  Dorothy. 

But  she  looked  too  cute,  so  the  ringlets  she 
always  wore  were  taken  away,  a  too-large  dress 
handed  out,  and  her  dialogue  cut  down  to  one 
word,  "Father." 

But  it  was  enough.  Her  own  father  arose 
from  a  sick  bed  and  traveled  to  Chattanooga, 
where  "The  Taming  of  the  Shrew"  was  show- 
ing.   Hardly  able  to  move — he  went. 

And  he  heard  Dot's  one  precious  word  of 
dialogue. 

"Father,"  she  said.     "Father." 

And  he  was  thrilled  and  proud.  And  died 
the  next  day  telling  folks  how  his  little  Dorothy 
had  stepped  right  out  from  the  screen  and  said, 
"  Father.  Just  like  she  was  right  here  beside 
me,  saying  'Father.'  " 

But  while  "The  Taming  of  the  Shrew"  was 
being  made,  Dorothy  gathered  up  her  mail  one 
day  and  while  waiting  for  a  stop  signal  at  the 
corner  of  Wilshire  Boulevard,  she  opened  the 
home  town  paper  and  there  it  was. 

One  whole  page  from  the  bank,  from  the 
grocery,  the  shops,  all  congratulating  Mr. 
Jordan,  their  fellow  merchant,  on  having 
such  a  little  Dorothy.  In  movies.  With  Mary 
Pickford,  too. 

And  Dorothy  read  it,  and  the  bell  rang  to 
go  on,  and  horns  honked,  and  people  screamed, 
but  Dorothy  Jordan  lay  with  her  head  on  the 
steering  wheel  and  cried  and  cried  and  cried. 

(^WER  at  M-G-M  she  stepped  into  "Devil 
^^May  Care"  with  Novarro,  and  Ramon  be- 
came helpless  and  hopeless.  He  spent  hours 
showing  her  how  to  steal  scenes  from  himself. 
And  thought  it  must  be  something  he'd  eaten 
or  a  touch  of  the  sun,  maybe. 

Today  she's  the  most  borrowed  young  ac- 
tress in  Hollywood. 

"We  want  Dorothy  Jordan,"  Radio  has 
cried,  and  Fox  has  cried,  and  First  National 
has  screamed  and  cried. 

Dear  me. 

Ruth  Biery  tells  you  on  another  page  of 
Photoplay  of  the  new  type  of  women  who  are 
coming  along.  Slim  and  aggravating  and  vo- 
luptuous. With  slumberous  eyes  and  hipless 
forms. 

But  do  the  men  care?  Not  much,  for  look 
at  our  little  Dorothy,  the  prize  bit  of  femininity 
in  Hollywood.  And  do  they  crowd  around 
Mrs.  Jordan's  little  girl  Dorothy?    Do  they? 

Why,  Hollywood's  scarce-of-jobs  vamps  sit 
back  and — well,  they  just  can't  understand  it. 
They  don't  realize  that  here  is  the  real  kind  in 
action. 

Just  a  little  girl  from  down  in  Tennessee. 
Doing  her  stuff.

When  real  life  laughs  are  few  and  far  between,  they're 
doubly  welcome  in  the  movies.  Jack  Haley,  from  the 
musical  comedy  stage,  helps  you  forget  gloom  with  his 
silly  antics  in  "Absent-Minded  Abner,"  reviewed  below 


ABSENT-MINDED  ABNER 

I  'ita  phone 
About  a  poor  sap  who  is  so  absent-minded  he 
can't  even  remember  his  best  girl's  name.  Jack 
Haley  and  his  ridiculous  gags  will  keep  you 
laughing,  and  Olive  Shea  (now  re-christened 
Gloria  Shea)  is  easy  on  the  eyes. 

THE  GIDDY  AGE 

Educational- Andy  Clyde 
Poor  Andy  Clyde !  Will  he  never  learn  about 
feminine  wiles?  This  gay  comedy  finds  him  a 
crusty  and  wealthy  old  bachelor  who  succumbs 
to  Dorothy  Granger's  seductive  looks.  It's 
very  funny. 

EMPIRE  OF  THE  SUN 
RKO-Van  Benren 
If  you're  letting  any  of  the  Vagabond  Adven- 
ture Series  slip  by,  you're  missing  a  lot  of  good 
entertainment,  plus  definite  educational  fea- 
tures. This  time  the  wandering  camera  picks 
up  a  Japanese  cherry  blossom  festival  and 
makes  it  come  to  life. 

FARMER  AL  FA L FA'S  BED- 
TIME STORY 

Educational-Paul  Terry-Toon 
When  farmer  Al  Falfa  puts  his  cat  out  for  the 
night,  gay  mad  mice  come  up  from  the  cellar  to 
turn  his  home  into  a  super-nightclub.  Another 
rollicking,  animated  cartoon,  accompanied  by 
the  sprightly  tunes  and  lyrics  that  characterize 
the  Terry-Toons. 

THE  GLAND  PARADE 
RKO-Radio 
In  which  Rosco  Ates  stu-stu-stutters  his  way 
through  a  maze  of  hospitals,  dentists'  offices, 
beauty  parlors  and  other  locations  that  lend 
themselves  to  rough  and  ready  comedy  of  the 
old-fashioned  slapstick  variety. 

IRON  MINNIE 
RKO-M asquers 

Another  of  those  swell  Masquers'  comedies 
with  Montagu  Love,  Mack  Swain,  Clyde  Cook 


and  other  first-class  funsters.  It's  all  about  a 
crooked  lawyer,  a  poor  "widow  woman,"  a 
stupid  son  and  the  brave  mounted  police — 
done  in  broad  burlesque. 

MAN-EATING  SHARKS 
Educational-Mack  Sennett 

Have  you  ever  inspected  a  shark's  dental 
work?  You  haven't?  Well,  just  see  this  latest 
episode  in  Mack  Sennett's  "Cannibals  of  the 
Deep"  series  and  you  will  have  a  chance.  Fine 
photography  and  thrills  for  fishermen. 

FAIRWAY  FAVORITES 
RKO-Pathe 

A  fine  Grantland  Rice  sports  subject  which 
not  only  shows  the  golf  methods  of  well-known 
champs  but  injects  a  little  comedy,  with  the 
aid  of  Rube  Goldberg,  as  well.  Golf  enthusi- 
asts shouldn't  miss  this. 

LOUD  MOUTH 
Paramount 

This  bright  little  yarn  about  a  rich  girl,  a 
baseball  player  and  some  professional  gamblers 
moves  along  at  a  racy  pace  and  is  chock-full  of 
laughs.    Franklin  Pangborn  is  great. 

TOY  TOWN 
RKO-Van  Beuren 

One  of  the  decidedly  better  animated  car- 
toons in  which  a  couple  of  little  mice  are  let 
loose  in  a  toy  shop.  Of  course,  they  are  not 
your  old  friends  Mickey  and  Minnie,  but 
they're  good. 

NOW'S  THE  TIME 
Educational -Vanity 

This  Harry  Barris  comedy  contains  more 
really  funny  gags  than  any  of  the  previous 
things  in  which  he  has  been  featured.  Mary 
Carlisle  is  a  pretty  little  blonde  heart  throb.

WOMAN  is  as  beau- 
tiful  as  her  hair- 
dress.  A  single  pin 
showing,  mars  even  a  perfect  coiffure — 
be  it  long,  bobbed  or  growing.  That's 
why  HOLD-BOBS  ere  the  invariable  rule 
among  well-groomed  women. 

HOLD-BOBS  are  invisible.  The  small, 
round  heads  cannot  be  seen.  The 
smooth  ends  cannot  scratch.  One  of 
the  flexible  legs  is  crimped  to  hold  the 
most  wayward  strand  in  place.  And 
HOLD-BOBS  come  in  light  or  dark  colors.

<l;irk,  brown  soil."  Has  some  unhappiness  come 
into  Nbnn&'s  life  to  make  her  harmonize  to 
brown? 

Ann  Harding  abhors  orange.  Her  hatred 
vibrates  so  strongly  that  she  becomes  almost  ill 
every  time  she  sees  it.     Naturally!     Orange  is 

the  color  which  tends  to  submerge  all  about  it, 
including  the  personality  of  the  one  wearing 

it. 

Ann  is  not  the  type  who  likes  to  be  sub- 
merged, as  her  life  has  shown.  In  fact,  I  think 
thi~  orange  hatred  tells  us  much  about  Ann. 

Since  the  day  she  married  Harry  Bannister 
she  has  been  trying  to  subjugate  herself  tohim. 
She  has  honestly  attempted  to  make  him  the 
important  member  of  their  family.  She  could- 
n't do  it,  and  their  divorce  was  the  result. 
Orange  denotes  so  much  vigor,  clashes  so 
harshly  with  the  dignified  depths  of  her 
strength,  that  it  antagonizes  her. 

Ann's  preference  is  light  green.  In  other 
wonts,  she  requires  a  sedative  rather  than  a 
stimulant. 

Constance  Bennett  and  Helen  Twelvetrees 
share  an  antipathy  for  red.  Connie  thought 
this  was  because  she  was  surfeited  with  red  in 
her  younger  days.  The  numerous  hotels  in 
which  she  stayed  while  traveling  with  her 
father,  Dick  Bennett,  were  always  decorated 
in  red  plush.  The  hotels  may  have  accen- 
tuated the  dislike,  but  was  it  not  instinctive? 
Connie,  like  Joan  Crawford,  must  be  cooled, 
not  further  excited!  And  her  favorite  is  blue — 
as  Joan's  is. 

Helen  Twelvetrees  frequently  wears  touches 
of  red  but  if  she  is  forced  to  sit  in  a  room 
decorated  with  it.  she  becomes  so  nervous  she 
can  scarcely  remain.  Undoubtedly,  this  is  be- 
cause Helen  does  not  radiate  so  strongly  to 
what  is  upon  her  as  to  that  which  is  around  her. 
Some  people  radiate,  you  know,  more  subtly 
to  their  surroundings  than  to  themselves. 
Helen  can  never  wear  all  red,  however.  And 
her  favorite  is  blue! 

IREXE  DUXXE  runs  from  pastels.     Espe- 
cially lavender.    White  is  her  favorite;  green 
a  close  second. 

Pastels,  particularly  lavender,  suggest  gen- 
tleness; old-fashioned  politeness;  a  wall-flower 
personality.  Irene  is  modern,  with  a  deter- 
mined belief  in  feminine  independence.  To  wit: 
her  insistence  upon  a  career  when  she  has  a 
doctor-husband  in  Xew  York  to  support  her. 


If  she  had  preferred  just  white,  we  would 
have  been  inclined  to  believe  her  cold,  dispas- 
sionate; but  since  green  is  her  second  choice 
we  must  add  ambitious. 

Claudette  Colbert's  pet  is  gray;  her  aversion 
purple.  She  also  heartily  dislikes  all  bright 
colors.  Xow,  this  may  mean  one  of  two  things. 
Either  Claudette  is  a  colorless,  in-between  per- 
son or  she  is  so  highly-strung,  tempestuous  and 
radical  that  bright  colors  jar  upon  her  because 
they,  too,  are  tempestuous.  They  aggravate 
her  natural  tendencies.  Of  course,  the  latter 
analysis  must  be  the  real  one. 

r^AROLE  LOMBARD'S  preference  is  black; 
^-*she  shuns  violet  or  purple.  She  feels  that 
the  ban  her  mother  pjt  upon  black  in  her  youth- 
ful days  created  a  longing  to  wear  it.  She  swore 
she  would  always  use  it  when  she  "grew  up.'' 
The  majority  of  her  street  clothes  are  black; 
many  of  her  evening  things  are  of  whiteor  black. 

Carole  is  vivacious  and  lively.  It  would  take 
a  hurricane  of  bad  luck  to  uproot  her  efferves- 
cent spirit.  She  has  a  quick  temper,  of  course; 
but  her  anger  is  over  in  a  second.  She's  ac- 
tually so  full  of  optimist^  energy  that  even 
dreary  black  or  dead  white  cannot  retard  it. 
Undoubtedly,  it  soothes  her;  keeps  her  in  tune 
with  other  people. 

Vet  a  seeming  contradiction,  she  dislikes  vio- 
let and  purple.  She  says  that  as  a  child  she  re- 
members a  particularly  crotchety  and  despic- 
able neighbor  who  wore  a  turban  of  purple 
violets.  In  Carole's  case,  this  undoubtedly  had 
much  to  do  with  her  antipathy.  She  hates 
with  the  same  energy  that  she  enjoys!  And, 
also,  all  half-measures  annoy  her.  Purple  is  a 
half-measure.  It  is  akin  to  black  in  its  effect, 
but  not  black. 

Don't  overlook  the  men.  They  have  their 
pet  shades,  also.  Color  is  as  vital  to  their  hap- 
piness and  success  as  it  is  to  women. 

Wallace  Beery  would  rather  see  his  wife  in 
bright  yellow  than  any  shade  of  the  rainbow. 
He  believes  it  is  because  his  Fourth  Grade 
teacher,  a  colorful  brunette  whom  he  adored, 
usually  wore  it.  To  the  big,  round  Wally — 
called  '"Jumbo"  by  the  other  boys — she  was 
the  epitome  of  daintiness  and  fragileness.  She 
was  undoubtedly  the  reason  for  his  remaining 
in  the  Fourth  Grade  so  long.  It  was  his  last. 
He  left  school  when  he  could  no  longer  have 
this  teacher. 

But  we  would  have  expected  big,  jovial,  slow- 


moving  Wally  to  radiate  to  the  most  stimulat- 
ing color  of  them  all.    A  yellow  necktie  gives 
him  the  same  sensation,  to  a  lesser  degn  i 
airplaning  does.     He  soars  out  of  his  heavy, 
ponderous,  physical  self. 

Hob  Montgomery  radiates  to  yellow  from 
the  reverse  angle.  His  yellow  scarfs,  you  know, 
are  typical  of  him.  Bob  is  the  type  that  radi- 
ates to  a  color  which  casts  the  same  wave 
lengths  as  his  own  personality.  Yellow  jon- 
quils are  his  favorite  flower.  He  is  crazy  about 
yellow  sweaters.  The  first  girl  he  kissed — he 
was  sixteen  and  escorted  her  from  a  tea-dance 
in  a  taxi — was  in  yellow.  Yellow — gaiety;  joy; 
glory;  power.  Wally  seeks  yellow  to  get  those 
qualities;  Bob  loves  yellow  because  he  already 
has  them. 

Jade  green  for  Clark  Gable!  The  wife  of  his 
first  theatrical  manager  always  wore  green ; 
there  was  a  large,  carved  jade  ring  on  her  finger: 
a  carved  jade  handle  to  her  parasol.  Her  hats 
had  jade  pins.  To  the  small  town  boy,  she 
was  the  last  word  in  sophistication  and  big 
city  smartness.  And  she  was  kind  to  him 
day,  he  always  selects  gifts  of  this  color.  He 
dislikes  red  and  orange. 

Jade  green  is  more  of  a  stimulant  than  a 
sedative.  It  is  employed  by  physicians,  for 
example,  who  are  more  and  more  using  color 
as  a  therapeutic  measure,  to  stop  headaches. 
The  jade  green  ray  stimulates  the  blood  current 
through  the  head.  But  it  is  a  more  subtle 
stimulant  than  red  or  orange. 

"|\TOW,  you  can  analyze  your  other  favorites. 
•^-^  Dorothy  Jordan  prefers  pink;  greens  and 
blues  depress  her.  Cfive  Brook  likes  red;  dislikes 
purple.  Sylvia  Sidney  hates  red;  prefers  green ; 
Frances  Dee  loves  any  shade  of  blue  and  de- 
tests chartreuse.  Fredric  March  chooses  green 
and  avoids  yellow.  Charlie  Farrell  selects  blue 
and  runs  from  black  and  yellow.  Ramon  Xo- 
varro  finds  comfort  from  deep,  warm  reds  and 
browns;  dislikes  blues,  pinks  and  other  delicate 
colors. 

Joan  Bennett's  favorites  are  green  and  blue; 
her  aversion  purple.  Dolores  Del  Rio  likes 
bright  colors;  loathes  purple. 

Picture  stars  as  a  whole  avoid  reds  and 
purples.  Reason?  They  are  too  emotional  to 
withstand  further  energetic  vibrations.  They 
are  also  too  sensitive  to  seek  anything  as  de- 
pressing as  purple. 

Xow  try  this  on  yourself  and  your  friends. 


The  Love-Life  of  Jimmy  Durante 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  60 


phase  of  our  courtship  was  ended.  Then,  to 
my  great  delight,  I  discovered  that  she  knew 
a  few  words  of  English,  most  of  which  un- 
fortunately are   not  reproduceable  in  print." 

"That's  too  bad,"  I  admitted. 

"Yes  and  no,"  he  agreed,  "but  after  a  few 
days  I  taught  her  the  fundamentals  of  English 
pronunciation  and  in  no  time  at  all  she  was 
talking  as  good  as  me." 

"Marvelous,"  I  exclaimed,  "and  then  what?" 

Mr.     Durante    yawned.       "Oh — the    usual 
thing,"  he  said,  "I  met  someone  else." 
•Whom?"  I  asked. 

"Does  it  matter?"  he  replied  with  an 
enigmatic  smile.  "Possibly,  Hedda  Hopper — 
possibly  Jean  Harlow." 

"Oh!"  I  exclaimed.  "Tell  me  what  Jean 
Harlow  is  like." 

"You  mean  what  she  was  like,"  he  cor- 
rected. 

"Has  anything  happened  to  her?"  I  asked. 


"I  suppose  so,"  he  replied.  "When  I  left 
her  for  Lily  Damita,  she  said  she  was  going  to 
commit  suicide.  Do  you  mean  to  say  she 
didn't?" 

"I  don't  believe  so,"  I  replied. 

"Why,  the  dirty  little  liar,"  was  Iris  dis- 
dainful comment. 

"Poor  girl,"  I  murmured. 

The  Great  Lover  shrugged  his  shoulders. 
"Is  it  my  fault,"  he  asked,  "that  God  has 
given  me  this  power  over  women?" 

I  was  forced  to  admit  that  it  wasn't  his 
fault. 

"And  yet,"  I  argued,  "hasn't  there,  some 
time  in  your  life,  been  one  woman — one  whom 
you  really  loved  and  wanted  to  marry?" 

His  face  grew  serious  and  he  hesitated  a 
long  time  before  replying.  I  could  see  that 
he  was  troubled  and  I  almost  regretted  asking 
the  question.  Finally  he  spoke,  "Benchley, 
old  man,"  he  said. 


"The  name  is  Stewart,"  I  corrected. 

"Stewart,  old  man,"  he  said,  "I  am  going 
to  tell  you  something  I've  never  told  anyone 
before." 

"Don't,  unless  you  want  to,"  I  urged. 

"I  want  to,"  he  replied.  "I  want  to  tell 
you  about  this  girl  because  I  want  the  world 
to  know  that  Durante  has  at  last  found  the 
perfect  woman.  A  woman  who  makes  all  the 
others  seem  like  shifting  sands  in  the  well  of 
time.  Oh,  I  know  I've  played  fast  and  loose 
with  feminine  hearts — I  know  I've  been  a 
butterfly  flitting  from  flower  to  flower.  And 
now  I  must  pay." 

"Pay?"  I  questioned. 

His  eyes  filled  with  tears  and  his  voice 
shook  as  he  spoke  the  following  unbelievable 
words,  "She  doesn't  love  me." 

I  sprang  up  aghast.  "Impossible."  I 
cried.  "A  woman  doesn't  love  you — you, 
whose  every  glance  causes  maidens'  hearts  to

palpitate — you,  whose  picture  is  in  every 
high-school  girl's  room  in  this  country — you, 
for  whom  princesses  would  give  kingdoms  just 
to  feel  your  lips  brush  their  necks.  Tell  me— 
who  is   this  girl?" 

"She's  a  girl,"  he  replied,  "who  combines 
everything  that  is  marvelous  with  all  that  is 
superb.     She  is  a  girl  who — " 

HE  couldn't  go  on.  His  sobbing  increased  in 
intensity  and  after  a  few  minutes,  I  arose 
and  prepared  to  take  my  adieu.  I  tiptoed,  as 
quietly  as  possible,  across  the  thick  carpets 
of  the  den  with  the  intention  of  leaving  the 
Great  Lover  alone  with  his  grief.  At  the  door, 
I  paused  and  looked  back.  There  he  sat,  his 
body  shaken  with  sobbing. 

I  put  my  hand  on  the  knob  of  the  door  and 
at  the  noise  of  its  opening,  he  slowly  turned 
and  faced  me. 

With  tears  streaming  down  his  cheeks  and 
his  lips  trembling,  he  bravely  tried  to  smile 
and  my  heart  went  out  to  him. 

"Wait,"  he  whispered. 

"And  I  waited  as  he  struggled  with  his 
emotions.  Finally,  he  got  control  of  himself 
and  with  trembling  lips  he  spoke. 

"Tell  my  public,"  he  said,  "tell  my  public 
that  the  only  girl  that  Jimmy  Durante  ever 
loved—" 

"Yes?"  I  asked,  for  he  had  once  more  given 
away  to  his  emotion. 

"The  only  girl  that  the  Great  Lover  of  the 
Audible  Screen  ever  loved  is — " 

I  waited  and  at  last  his  lips  formed  the  words. 

"Marie  Dressier." 

He  sank  back  once  more  into  his  chair  and 
I  closed  the  door  softly  behind  me,  leaving 
him  alone  with  his  grief.

STRANGER  IN  TOWN— Warners 

TOO  bad  there's  only  one  characterization 
for  Chic  Sale.  When  you've  seen  him  in 
one,  you've  seen  all.  If  you  liked  the  others, 
you'll  like  this.  He's  the  antiquated  and  only 
gmceryman  in  a  small  town  until  a  chain  store 
busts  in.  His  business  slumps,  his  grand- 
daughter marries  his  competitor,  his  friends 
forget — until  the  end.  Then  good  little  fairies 
fix  everything!     Kids  will  love  it. 


THE  TEXAS  BAD  MAN— Universal 

•"POM  MIX  can  shoot,  ride  and  act  himself 
■*-  into  everyone's  interest.  As  an  officer  of  the 
law  he  impersonates  a  desperado  in  order  to 
trap  a  band  of  outlaws.  Tom,  interested  in  the 
sister  of  the  gang  leader,  outshoots  the  mob 
during  a  bank  robbery  and  wins  the  girl. 
Tony,  his  horse,  is  featured,  and  everyone  is 
sure  of  a  thrilling  evening. 

THE  JEWEL  ROBBERY— Warners 

A  SMART  little  trick  that  tries  too  desper- 
•**■  ately  to  be  cleverer  than  it  is.  The  picture 
strains  for  smartness  and  a  bit  of  naughtiness. 
Just  the  same,  a  gay  job,  with  Kay  Francis 
excellent  as  a  lovely  baroness  and  William 
Powell  fine  as  a  handsome  and  amorous  bur- 
glar. The  banter  is  bright  and  some  of  the  situa- 
tions fascinating  but,  somehow,  the  picture 
just  fails  to  click  as  a  truly  clever  film. 

WHILE  PARIS  SLEEPS— Fox 

"DIG  Victor  McLaglen  is  head  man  of  this 
■^rip-snorting  mellerdrammer  of  Parisian  life 
through  a  Hollywood  spy-glass.  Lots  of  ac- 
tion, with  fights  galore,  and  enough  romance 
to  please  the  sentimentally  inclined.  You 
don't  believe  it,  but  you  don't  want  to,  any- 
how. Vic  is  good,  in  his  swashbuckling  way, 
and  Billy  Bakewell  and  Helen  Mack  take  care 
of  the  love  situation  nicely. 

THE  BIG  PARADE— 
M-G-M — Reissued  with  Sound 

•"THE  youthful  Jack  Gilbert  of  seven  years 
■*■  ago  still  initiates  the  little  French  peasant 
girl  (Renee  Adoree)  into  the  mysteries  of 
American  gum-chewing.  And  the  grim  lines  of 
American  doughboys  advancing  through  a 
forest  infested  with  German  snipers  hold  the 
same  thrill  as  when  "The  Big  Parade"  won 
the  Photoplay  Gold  Medal  for  1925.  Sound 
effects  have  been  skilfully  introduced.  Well 
worth  seeing  again. 

BIG  CITY  BLUES— Warners 

JUST  another  version  of  the  innocent  youth 
who  goes  to  New  York,  is  taken  in  by  the 
wrong  crowd,  loses  his  heart  and  his  money 
and  is  back  home  in  three  days.  Joan  Blondell 
and  Eric  Linden  make  an  interesting  couple, 
by  sheer  contrast,  in  this  drama  of  New  York 
.  .  .  gayety  that  turns  to  ashes  when  a  mem- 
ber of  a  wild  party  is  accidentally  killed. 

A  MAN'S  LAND— 
First  Division-Allied 

RATTLE  rustling,  nasty  villains,  Hoot  Gib- 
^-'son's  riding  and  we  have  another  Western. 
Hoot  becomes  part  owner  of  a  ranch  in  this 
one  with  Marion  Shilling  owning  the  other 
half.  The  local  banker  attempts  to  steal 
Hoot's  cattle  and  plenty  of  excitement  follows. 
Beautiful  shots,  fine  riding,  a  dandy  story  and 
a  good  time  for  all. 


PASSPORT  TO  PARADISE— 
May  fair  Pictures 

^"*\NE  of  those  made-in-a-week  "quickies" 
^-^meant  for  people  who  enjoy  their  adven- 
ture by  proxy.  Jack  Mulhall  is  left  two  cents 
and  a  pair  of  pants.     If  he  gets  around  the 


Acme 


See  here,  young  woman,  is  that  any 
way  to  dress  in  a  courtroom?  And 
standing  right  on  the  judge's  desk, 
too.  Tut,  tut!  But  three-year-old 
Jackie  Lyn  got  her  contract  to  appear 
in  "Our  Gang"  comedies  approved 
by  law  just  the  same.  She  will  make 
$100  a  week  the  first  year  and  $175 
the  second — which  ought  to  keep  her 
in  lollipops  for  quite  some  little  while 


world  in  three  months  his  reward  will  be 
S4.000,000.  He  meets  Princess  Blanche  Me- 
haffey,  whose  loveliness  inspires  hope  for  fur- 
ther reward.  Not  even  a  cheap  production  can 
spoil  that  will-he-make-it  interest. 

FLAMES — First  Division-Monogram 

TF  you  do  not  thrill  at  the  sound  of  a  fire- 
-'-engine  siren  you  had  better  stay  home  when 
this  is  shown.     But  if  you  like  the  fire-boys, 


you  have  a  treat  in  store  for  you.  This  is  no 
fake  fire.  Likeable  Johnny  Mack  Brown  is 
the  hero. 

MONTE  CARLO  MADNESS— 
UFA-First  Division 

T_TERE'S  the  picture  that  Sari  Maritza,  now 
*■  -"-being  ballyhooed  in  this  country  as  one  of 
the  coming  glamour  girls,  made  abroad.  Al- 
though the  music  is  tuneful,  the  dialogue  in 
English  and  the  atmosphere  charming,  it's  not 
a  knock-out.  Sari  plays  the  role  of  a  petulant 
queen.  She  looks  beautiful,  but  you'd  better 
wait  awhile  to  see  whether  she  can  act  or  not. 


TWO  FISTED  LAW— Columbia 

A  X OTHER  villain  forecloses  the  mortgage 
■**-on  the  old  ranch  by  hook  or  crook.  Mostly 
crook.  And  Tim  McCoy  finds  himself  home- 
less and  accused  of  murder.  Xothing  new  or 
exciting  in  this  one.  A  beautiful,  well-trained 
horse  is  the  highlight. 


FORGOTTEN  COMMANDMENTS— 
Paramount 

CARI  MARITZA  is  new.  The  flash-backs 
'-'are  old.  The  story  is  tripe.  They  took  a  lot 
of  stuff  from  C.  B.  De  Mule's  "Ten  Com- 
mandments" (and  is  it  funny  now!)  and  stuck 
it  into  a  yarn  about  modern  Russia,  or  rather, 
Hollywood's  conception  of  modern  Russia. 
You  can't  tell  whether  Sari  is  a  comer  or  not 
when  even  such  good  actors  as  Gene  Raymond 
and  Irving  Pichel  fail  to  come  through  with 
such  material. 

THE   MAN  FROM  HELL'S  EDGES— 
World  Wide 

"Y"OU  won't  guess  the  identity  of  Bob  Steele 
■*■  until  the  end  of  this  Western.  As  an  es- 
caped convict  he  goes  back  to  a  small  mining 
town  where  he  becomes  a  deputy  to  the  sheriff. 
Things  pop  from  then  on.  Lots  of  gun  play, 
fast  horsemanship  and  flying  fists.  Pretty 
Nancy  Drexel  provides  the  feminine  interest. 

THE  MIDNIGHT  LADY— 

Chesterfield 

STILL  another  mother  makes  the  supreme 
sacrifice  for  her  child.  The  old  Madame  X 
story,  but  with  enough  interest  to  make  a  fair 
evening's  entertainment.  Sarah  Padden  gives 
a  sincere  performance  as  a  child-deserter  and 
Johnny  Darrow,  Claudia  Dell  and  Theodore 
Yon  Eltz  add  new  strength  to  an  old  story. 

THE  SILVER  LINING— 
Patrician  Pictures 

NOT  quite  just  another  picture,  but  near  it. 
Betty  Compson  saves  it  from  being  that. 
Maureen  O'Sullivan.  as  the  self-centered  girl 
of  wealth,  learns  how  the  lower  class  live  after 
serving  a  term  in  jail.  John  Warburton  is  the 
poor  young  lawyer  Maureen  finally  marries. 
If  you  must  see  a  picture,  this  will  do. 

THEY  NEVER  COME  BACK— 
First  Division- Artclass 

A  MILDLY  dull  little  picture  about  a  prize 
lighter,  a  sweet  night  club  entertainer  and 
a  wayward  brother.  Regis  Toomey's  smile  and 
Dorothy  Sebastian's  hula  dance  are  its  two 
redeeming  features. 


THE  RINGER— 
First  Division-Gainsborough 

A  JOLLY  little  mystery  story  from  jolly  old 
England  in  which  a  murderer  with  an  un- 
canny rlaie  for  disguising  himself  in  differ- 
ent ways  gives  Scotland  Yard  several  bad 
moments.  From  the  pen  of  the  late  Edgar 
Wallace,  the  yarn  is  well  worked  out  and  will 
please  mystery  addicts. 

RIDERS  OF  THE  DESERT— 
World  Wide 

BOB  STEELE  rides  at  a  fast  pace  through 
this  tale  of  rangers  who  keep  desert  outlaws 
at  the  point  of  a  gun.  The  story  opens  with  the 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  August,  1932 

rangers  disbanding  by  order  of  the  governor, 
but  when  a  member  is  shot  in  the  back,  they 
ride  forth  to  avenge  his  death.  Plenty  of  gun- 
fire and  action.  Gertie  Messinger  is  the  fair 
object  of  Steele's  softer  moods! 

THE  LAST  OF  THE  MOHICANS— 
Mascot  Pictures  Corp. 

THE  war-whoop  of  the  warring  Hurons  sends 
this  serialization  of  the  great  Cooper  classic 
off  to  a  thrilling  start.  You  who  trembled  over 
the  daring  exploits  of  Hawkeye,  Uncas  and 
The  Sagamore,  must  follow  this  from  the  first 
episode  to  the  last.  The  first  chapter  leaves 
Hobart  Bosworth,  Harry  Carey  and  Edwina 
Booth  facing  imminent  death!    Ah-ha!

Photoplay  Magazine  for  August,  1932 

Screen    Memories    From    Photoplay 


10  Years  Ago 

1  I  'rilS  was  a  busy  month  for  Photoplay  re- 
■*•  porters  and  Cal  York  recorded  a  number  of 
vital  statistics  which  are  interesting  to  look 
back  upon  now.  Marilyn  Miller  and  Jack 
Pickford  had  just  confirmed  the  rumor  of  their 
engagement;  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Buster  Keaton 
were  the  proud  parents  of  a  son;  Rudolph 
Valentino  had  just  been  freed  of  bigamy 
charges  (remember  about  his  Mexican  mar- 
riage to  Natacha  Rambova  before  his  divorce 
was  final?);  Mary  Pickford's  divorce  from 
Owen  Moore  was  at  last  upheld  and  Mabel 
Normand  had  sailed  for  England,  telling  her 
friends  that  she  was  tired  and  needed  a  rest. 
Poor  Mabel — she  knew  that  she  was  more  than 
just  tired. 

Our  cameraman  caught  Eric  Von  Stroheim 
at  a  mountain  retreat  where  he  was  preparing 
his  script  for  some  new  big  picture.  At  that 
time  Von  was  at  his  directorial  height — Holly- 
wood's most  vivid  personality,  known,  loved 
and  feared.  Strange  that  he  should  be  only 
acting  now  (you  can  see  him  in  Garbo's  "As 
You  Desire  Me")  when  he  can  tell  most 
directors  tricks  they  never  knew  before.  Poor 
Von!  His  life  has  been  one  of  the  stormiest 
upon  the  Hollywood  sea. 

Madge  Bellamy  was  the  girl  on  the  cover  and 
the  gallery  stars  were  Mary  Pickford,  Alice 
Terry,  Bert  Lytell,  Jackie  Coogan  (looking  for 
all  the  world  like  Robert  does  now),  Constance 
and  Norma  Talmadge,  Tony  Moreno  and  Nita 
Naldi. 

The  best  pictures — although  we  admitted  it 
was  a  slim  month — were  "Nanook  of  the 
North,"  "Nero,"  "Sonny,"  "Our  Leading 
Citizen,"  "Salome"  and  "Her  Back  Against 
the  Wall."

Here's  the  Corinne  Griffith  of  fif- 
teen years  ago  in  "Miss  Ambi- 
tion." Sure,  that's  a  funny  hat, 
but  Corinne's  beauty  can't  be 
hidden.  Too  long  away  from  the 
screen,  she  will  soon  be  seen  in  an 
English  film,  "Lily  Christine." 
Sorry  we're  unable  to  remember 
the  name  of  the  elegant  dandy 
who  acted  with  her  in  this  old  still

Ago 


'"THE  United  States  was  at  war  and  we  re- 
*■  ported  that  all  the  stars  were  doing  their 
"bit,"  and  proved  it  by  pictures  of  Enid 
Bennett,  Sylvia  B reamer  and  Olive  Thomas  tak- 
ing instruction  in  a  nurses'  class.  How  were  we 
to  know  that  when  chauvinistic  hysteria  had 
died  down  the  greatest  preachments  against 
war  were  to  come  from  the  screen  in  pictures 
like  "All  Quiet  on  the  Western  Front." 

But,  in  spite  of  the  dark  shadows  cast  by  the 
war  clouds,  we  found  time  to  hail  the  newest 
screen  idol.  Antonio  Moreno  was  the  lad  that 
caused  all  those  long  sighs  from  the  girls  of 
fifteen  years  ago.  Now  Tony,  having  finished 
directing  a  picture  in  Mexico,  sits  back  and 
listens  to  the  folk  sing  pasans  of  praise  to  Clark 
Gable,  Johnny  Weissmuller  and  George  Raft. 
But  Tony  was  as  big  in  his  day  as  these. 

Another  new  discovery  was  a  girl  who  had 
just  played  a  bit  in  William  Farnum's  "A  Tale 
of  Two  Cities,"  and  we  tossed  off  the  prophecy 
that  Florence  Vidor  would  be  a  star  some  day. 
She  lived  up  to  expectations  but  now  she  is 
content  with  being  a  wife  and  mother.  Jascha 
Heifetz,  the  famous  violinist,  is  her  husband, 
you  know. 

Lionel  Barrymore  was  the  first  big  stage  per- 
sonality to  enter  pictures,  but  what  neither  we 
nor  Lionel  knew  was  that  this  great  actor  was 
to  wait  almost  fifteen  years  for  his  greatness  to 
be  recognized  by  Hollywood. 

Jackie  Saunders  was  the  girl  on  the  cover  and 
our  leading  gallery  picture  was  of  Corinne 
Griffith,  whom  we  called,  even  then,  the  most 
beautiful  girl  on  the  screen.  Others  in  the 
gallery  were  Harry  Hilliard,  Julia  Sanderson, 
George  Webb  (Esther  Ralston's  husband  now), 
Mrs.  Vernon  Castle,  William  Davidson,  Sylvia 
Breamer  and  Mary  Pickford. 

Films  reviewed  included  Norma  Talmadge 
in  "Poppy,"  Sessue  Hayakawa  in  "The 
Jaguar's  Claws,"  Mary  Pickford  in  "A  Ro- 
mance of  the  Redwoods,"  Gail  Kane  (remem- 
ber her?)  in  "The  Upper  Crust,"  and  Wallace 
Reid  in  "The  Squaw  Man's  Son." 

Cal  York  item:  Taylor  Holmes  has  quit  the 
stage  for  the  movies  (and  now  Taylor's  son 
Phillips  is  a  swell  actor  like  his  dad). 


5  Years  Ago 


JUST  above,  in  the  ten  years  ago  section, 
you'll  see  that  Marilyn  Miller  and  Jack  Pick- 
ford were  soon  to  be  married.  Five  years  ago 
Marilyn  was  in  Paris  to  get  a  divorce.  In  fact, 
there  was  an  epidemic  of  divorces  in  Hollywood 
just  then.  Marie  Prevost  and  Kenneth 
Harlan;  Miriam  Cooper  and  Raoul  Walsh; 
Agnes  Ayres  and  Manuel  Reachi — all  had 
come  to  the  parting  of  the  ways.  And  the 
erstwhile  matinee  idol,  Maurice  Costello,  was 
separated  from  his  wife.  That  separation  was 
the  cause  of  a  rift  in  the  Costello  family  that 
only  the  last  few  months  have  patched  up,  for 
Dolores  and  Helene  sided  with  their  mother 
and  did  not  see  their  father  for  years. 

We  were  thrilled  and  excited — as  was  the 
rest  of  the  world — by  Gloria  Swanson's  pur- 
chase of  Jeanne  Eagels'  stage  success,  "Rain," 
and  we  wondered  if  she  dared  make  it,  as  Will 
Hays  banned  it.  The  picture  was  finally  called 
"Sadie  Thompson"  and  now,  just  five  years 
later,  with  Gloria  in  London,  Joan  Crawford 
is  playing  Sadie  Thompson  for  the  talkies. 

A  strange  and  tragic  death  was  that  of  Einar 
Hansen,  a  young  Swedish  lad  signed  about  the 
same  time  Garbo  was,  and  an  intimate  friend 
of  Garbo.  He  was  killed  in  an  automobile 
accident  and  there  are  folks  who  will  tell  you 
that  the  occurrence  cast  a  cloud  over  Garbo's 
happiness  and  partly  accounts  for  her  mystery. 

The  girl  on  the  cover  was  Olive  Borden  and 
the  gallery  included  Clara  Bow,  Eleanor  Board- 
man,  Thomas  Meighan,  Buddy  Rogers,  Gilda 
Gray  and  Anna  May  Wong. 

The  six  best  pictures  were  "The  Way  of  All 
Flesh,"  "The  Unknown,"  "Cradle  Snatchers," 
"The  World  at  Her  Feet,"  "The  Woman  on 
Trial"  and  "Man  Power." 

Cal  York  items:  Douglas  Fairbanks  Jr.  and 
Helene  Costello  are  going  together.  .  .  .  Bebe 
Daniels  and  Charlie  Paddock  are  no  longer 
engaged  to  be  married.  .  .  .  Jack  Gilbert  and 
Greta  Garbo  are  going  to  play  opposite  each 
other  in  "Love."

Sh-h-h ! 

(a  secret!) 

Not  a  soul  will  know  just  what  you  have 
done  to  make  your  hair  so  lovely!  Certainly 
nobody  would  dream  that  a  single  shampoo- 
ing could  add  such  beauty — such  delightful 
lustre — such  exquisite  soft  tones! 

A  secret  indeed  —  a  beauty  specialist's  se- 
cret! But  you  may  share  it,  too!  Just  one 
Golden  Glint  Shampoo*  will  show  you  the 
way!  At  your  dealers',  25c,  or  send  for  free 
sample! 

*(Note:  Do  not  confuse  this  with  other  shampoos 
that  merely  cleanse.  Golden  Glint  Shampoo  in 
addition  to  cleansing,  gives  your  hair  a  "tiny-tint" 
—a  -wee  little  hit—not  much—hardly  perceptible. 
But  how  it  does  bring  out  the  true  beauty  of 
your  own  individual  shade  of  hair!)

ward  skid.  Billy  rented  his  big  house  to 
Tallulah  Bankhead,  stopped  giving  parties 
which  included  bouquets  of  orchids  for  every 
lady  present,  moved  into  a  little  apartment  and 
immediately  began  doing  some  good  serious 
work  again. 

Bill  was  great,  in  an  entirely  different  type 
of  role,  in  "Are  You  Listening?" 

Many  stars  waste  their  energies  amusing 
Hollywood  when  they  really  should  be  amusing 
you. 

Personality  is  a  strange  thing — that  some- 
thing that  seems  to  reach  out  from  the  screen 
and  take  an  audience  by  storm.  It  very  often 
hasn't  a  thing  to  do  with  great  acting  for,  as  a 
rule,  if  a  star  has  the  sort  of  personality  an 
audience  likes  it  doesn't  matter  what  she  does 
on  the  screen. 

If  she  hasn't  got  it — well,  it  matters  even 
less. 

HpAKE  the  case  of  Sylvia  Sidney,  for  instance. 
■*-  That  girl  has  had  the  biggest  picture  breaks 
Hollywood  had  to  offer — "Street  Scene," 
"Ladies  of  the  Big  House,"  "An  American 
Tragedy." 

Everybody  admits  that  she's  a  great  actress, 
but  so  far  she  has  failed  to  be  a  tremendous 
personal  favorite  with  you  fans. 

Some  warm,  vital  quality  is  lacking  within 
her.  For  all  her  smoldering  eyes  and  her  alluring 
mouth,  there  is  something  cold  about  Sylvia 
that  can't  be  hidden. 

Vet,  Tallulah  Bankhead  has  had  a  series  of 
bad  pictures  and  her  personality  has  clicked  in 
spite  of  it. 

If  ever  the  Bankhead  girl  gets  the  right  film 
stories  she'll  skyrocket,  for  her  personality  gets 
through  that  silver  screen. 

Now  if  Tallulah  just  had  Sylvia's  chance 
in  grand  screen  material — what  a  star  she 
would  be. 

Besides  those  already  mentioned,  here  are 
the  stars  you've  made — Clara  Bow  (producers 
laughed  at  her  when  she  applied  for,  her  first 
jobs);  Barbara  Stanwyck  (Hollywood  said  she 
was  a  complete  flop  in  her  first  picture) ;  Una 
Merkel  (they  didn't  see  her  as  a  comedienne, 
wanted  to  play  her  as  a  second  Gish,  then  by 
good  luck  she  got  a  comedy  role  and  you  said 
she  was  swell);  Joan  Crawford  (just  another 
chorus  girl  given  a  small  contract — you  dis- 
covered Joan  and  don't  forget  it) ;  Wynne 
Gibson  (played  small  parts  until  you  started 
yelling  for  her  and  they  had  to  star  her  in  "The 
Strange  Case  of  Clara  Deane");  Minna  Gom- 
bell  (they  thought  all  she  was  good  for  was  to 
teach  other  actresses  how  to  speak  and  walk 
correctly.  She  begged  for  the  role  of  Edna  in 
"Bad  Girl,"  got  it,  and  you  said  "Okay, 
Minna"). 

YOU  don't  enjoy  being  told  whom  you  should 
like  and  whom  you  shouldn't. 

■\Yith  much  ballyhoo  Ina  Claire  was  brought 
to  Hollywood. 

She  was  a  great  stage  star,  she  had  a  tremen- 
dous following  on  Broadway,  and  while  she  has 
done  some  highly  creditable  movie  jobs  she  has 
not  made  a  sensation. 

Yet  Helen  Hayes  is  also  a  great  stage  star, 
and  in  "The  Sin  of  Madelon  Claudet"  and 
"Arrow-smith"  she  clicked  with  you  one  hun- 
dred per  cent. 

Marlene  Dietrich  is  an  exception.  She  was  a 
Hollywood-made,  publicity-made  star.  But 
you  liked  her. 

She  was  dished  out  to  you  on  a  silver  platter. 

She's  the  only  one  I  can  think  of  who  was 
handed  to  you  that  you  took! 

So  don't  let  the  producers  tell  you  different. 
That  little  theater  in  your  own  home  town  is 
the  real  talent  testing  and  casting  office  of  the 
cinema  world!

Winners  of  Photoplay's 
Big  Treasure  Hunt 


WHEN  Photoplay  Magazine  an- 
nounced, in  the  April  issue,  its  first 
Treasure  Hunt  Prize  Contest,  we  had  not 
anticipated  so  tremendous  a  response  from 
our  readers.  But  as  the  volume  of  entries 
began  to  roll  in  we  awoke  to  the  fact  that 
we  had  started  something.  The  Treasure 
Hunt,  a  new  kind  of  contest  invented  by 
Photoplay  Magazine,  obviously  gave  ev- 
eryone that  tried  it  a  lot  of  fun,  for  a  good 
many  thousands  were  trying  it. 

When  the  contest  closed  at  the  stipu- 
lated hour,  midnight  of  May  5th,  so 
enormous  a  volume  of  entries  had  been 
received  that  it  was  impossible  to  go 
through  all  of  them  carefully  in  time  for 
announcement  in  the  July  issue.     Every 
state  in  the  Union  was  many  times  repre- 
sented and  nineteen  foreign  countries  be-

sides.  If  a  large  map  of  the  United  States 
were  stuck  with  pins,  each  one  represent- 
ing a  contest  entrant,  the  map  would  re- 
semble a  bristling  forest.  And  for  many 
large  centers  of  population  pins  of  another 
color,  representing  fifty  or  a  hundred  en- 
trants each,  would  have  to  be  used  to  find 
room  for  them  in  the  right  place. 

Because  of  the  great  success  of  this  con- 
test and  because  of  the  tremendous  in- 
terest shown  in  it  by  our  readers,  Photo- 
play Magazine  is  offering  you  another 
Treasure  Hunt  with  thirty-three  prizes. 
Announcement  and  conditions  of  the  new 
contest  will  be  found  on  page  121,  this  issue

^7~OUTSTG  woman,  you  can  help  him  get  one!     Strange  as  it  may 
-*•  seem  in  these  times,  there  is  a  group  of  500  manufacturers 
seeking  bright  young  men — and  women,  too. 

They  can  work  right  in  their  own  home  towns,  and  are  offered 
an  amazing  variety  of  quick-selling  novelties  and  high  grade, 
merchandise  which  every  home  must  have. 

Go  right  out  today  and  invest  ten  cents  in  a  copy  of  Opportunity 
Magazine.  It's  on  all  newsstands.  Give  it  to  him  and  say,  "Boy, 
there's  your  chance.  Don't  say  I  never  gave  you  a  start  in  life. 
Some  day  you  may  come  to  me  and  thank  me  for  starting  you  in 
a  real  business  career." 

Even  if  he  has  never  sold  anything — if  he  has  the  gumption  and 
any  personality  at  all,  he  can  make  a  success  of  direct  selling. 
Opportunity  tells  him  how  to  do  it.  The  positions  are  there. 
It's  up  to  him.

Cal  York's  Monthly  Broadcast  from  Hollywood 


ISTKD  FROM  PACE    1  1  1 


Hollywood's  funniest  gag  of  the  month!  Conrad  Nagel  had  been  away 
from  Hollywood  for  so  long  on  a  personal  appearance  tour  that  his  friends 
and  family  were  afraid  he  wouldn't  recognize  them,  so  they  trouped  down 
to  the  train  to  meet  him  like  this.  Rod  LaRocque,  Leatrice  Joy's  husband 
and  director  Sidney  Franklin  swore  they  had  grown  these  muffs  during 
his  absence.  Look  sharp  and  you'll  identify  Leatrice  Joy,  Vilma  Banky, 
Mrs.  Conrad  Nagel  and  their  little  girl,  Ruthie 


"\\7ALTER  HUSTON  has  to  have  his  nat- 
urally    straight    hair    marcelled    on    the 
average  of  three  times  a  day  for  his  role  of 
Rn.  Davidson  in  ''Rain." 

He  no  sooner  appears  on  the  set  with  a  new 
marcel,  than  they  turn  on  the  rain  pipes,  and 
his  curls  are  gone.  And  is  he  disgusted?  One 
marcel  is  bad  enough,  to  Huston's  type! 

JIMMY  DURANTE  walked  into  the  outer  re- 
•*  ception  room  at  Metro.  A  woman,  sitting  on 
one  of  the  cold,  wooden  chairs  which  usually 
held  extras,  said,  "Hello,  Mr.  Durante.  Don't 
you  remember  me?'' 

Jimmy,  who  never  remembers  anybody, 
nodded.    "Of  course.    Hello." 

"I  don't  think  you  do.  I'm  Ethel  Barry- 
more." 

"And  I'm  Lillian  Russell,"  said  Jimmy, 
wondering  how  he  could  avoid  what  he  thought 
was  surely  going  to  be  a  touch. 

"But  Mr. Durante, don't  you  remember  how 
you  played  for  a  party  I  gave  in  New  York?"' 

"Sure.  Sure.  Glad  to  have  seen  you.*' 
Jimmy  sauntered  over  to  the  desk.  The  infor- 
mation boy  was  all  agog.  He  whispered  to 
Jimmy.  "Gee,  I  didn't  know  you  were  ac- 
quainted with  Ethel  Barrymore!  She  just 
came  down  from  Mr.  Thalberg's  office  and  is 
waiting  for  her  chauffeur.    She — "

But  Jimmy  was  gone.  He  was  in  front  of 
Miss  Barrymore.  "Sure.  I  remember  that 
party.  Gee,  it's  swell  you're  out  here.  When 
do  you  start — " 

A  fast  one  on  Jimmy! 

OEEN  on  the  set  of  "Skyscraper 
^ Souls,"  the  other  morning.  John 
Ince,  formerly  one  of  our  headline 
directors  and  brother  of  the  famous 
Tom  Ince,  running  the  elevator! 

V"  NOW  who  are  moviedom's  greatest  wan- 
-'-Xlerers?  The  Richard  Barthelmesses!  Dick 
and  his  wife  have  the  itching  foot,  and  probably 
do  more  traveling  and  sight-seeing  than  any- 
other  two  people  in  Holly-wood. 

From  the  Canadian  woods  to  Honolulu  and 
on  to  war-torn  China  is  just  a  little  side  trip 
for  them. 

Now  as  soon  as  his  new  picture,  "The  Cabin 
in  the  Cotton,"  is  finished,  the  Barthelmesses 
will  take  themselves  and  their  two  children  for 
a  long  voyage  to  Denmark,  Norway  and 
Sweden.  Just  back  from  the  Orient,  they're 
ott  for  another  spot  on  the  map. 

■"THE  city  of  Troy,  N.  Y.,  is  in  a  medium- 
sized  dither. 

Now  fame  has  come  to  the  Collar  Town. 
Leila  Hyams,  it  has  been  alleged,  made  her 
first  stage  appearance  there.  Her  dad,  John 
Hyams,  was  a  Troy  boy,  or  Trojan,  and  when 
he  and  his  partner-wife,  Leila  Mclntyre,  were 
toting  baby  Leila  around  in  vaudeville,  they 
played  the  home  town.  Naturally,  John  got  a 
great  reception  from  the  home  folks,  and  for  an 
encore,  carried  the  baby  on  the  stage.  That 
was  lovely  Leila's  debut. 

Now  a  strong  demand  for  Leila's  pictures  is 
noted,  Who  was  this  dame  Helen  of  Troy, 
anyway?    Must  have  meant  Leila! 


Here's  the  most  critical  audience  in  the  world— the  folks  who  sit  in  studio 
projection  rooms  looking  at  the  daily  scenes  before  they  are  cut  or  the 
best  "takes"  chosen.  How  would  you  feel  if  you  were  Marian  Nixon,  who 
watches  herself  act  before  this  group  of  these  picture-wise  people? 
"Rebecca  of  Sunnybrook  Farm"  is  the  film  they're  seeing.  That's  leading 
man  Ralph  Bellamy  and  director  Al  Santell  at  Marian's  right  and  left

When  the  audience  speaks  the  stars  and  producers  listen.  We  offer  three  prizes  for  the 
best  letters  of  the  month — $25,  $10  and  $5.  Literary  ability  doesn't  count.  But  candid 
opinions  and  constructive  suggestions  do.  We  must  reserve  the  right  to  cut  letters  to 
suit  space  limitations.    Address  The  Editor,  PHOTOPLAY,  221  W.  57th  St.,  New  York  City. 


"Rebecca  of  Sunnybrook  Farm"  was  the  month's  favorite.  "Louise  Closser  Hale 
stole  the  film,"  one  movie-goer  wrote.  "Even  Janet  Gaynor  couldn't  have  been  better 
than  Marian  Nixon,"  said  another.    Here  are  Louise,  Mae  Marsh  and  Marian 


THE  $25  LETTER 

It  surprises  me  that  of  the  many  articles  on 
"How  to  Be  Happy  Though  Married,"  not 
one  I  have  seen  has  mentioned  motion  pictures. 
My  husband  and  I  have  found  that  they  act 
very  nicely  as  a  peace-maker. 

Our  system  is  simple  and  effective.  If,  or 
when,  one  of  our  arguments  shows  signs  of 
running  a  temperature,  one  of  us — whichever 
is  most  in  command  of  his  faculties — rushes  to 
the  telephone  and  calls  all  the  nearest  motion 
picture  theaters.  We  declare  a  truce  long 
enough  to  decide  which  feature  is  likely  to 
prove  most  diverting.  Then  we  maintain 
absolute  silence  all  the  way  to  the  theater.  At 
least,  such  is  our  intention.  Of  course,  there 
are  times  .  .  . 

At  any  rate,  when  we  emerge  from  the 
theater  a  couple  of  hours  later,  all  is  changed. 
Hither  we  have  forgotten  what  the  fuss  was 
about  or  we  are  prepared  to  discuss  it  amicably. 
It  works  like  a  charm  and  I  recommend  it  to 
all  wives  and  husbands. 

Mrs.  H.  L.  Holt,  Bloomfield,  N.  J. 

THE  $10  LETTER 

Yesterday  I  met  a  friend  on  the  street,  hold- 
ing her  small  daughter  by  the  hand  and  bewail- 
ing the  fact  that,  "There  isn't  a  movie  in  town 
suitable  for  Dorothy  to  see." 

"Well,  if  there  were,  would  you  want  to  sit 
through  it?"  I  asked. 

And  that,  to  me,  is  the  answer  to  all  this 
ridiculous  discussion  about  showing  only  films 
planned  for  the  "home  circle."  There  are 
plenty  of  amusements  suitable  for  small 
children  and,  incidentally,  plenty  of  suitable 
pictures  for  an  occasional  treat. 

Personally,  I  don't  want  all  my  plays,  books 
and  movies  graded  to  the  intelligence  and  ex- 
perience of  a  six-year-old  child. 

FLORENCE  W.  Long,  Indianapolis,  Ind. 


THE  $5  LETTER 

Why  this  complaint  about  the  lack  of  variety 
in  pictures?  Not  long  ago  our  city  enjoyed  a 
real  premiere.  "Scarfacc"  was  shown  for  the 
first  time  in  any  theater,  here  in  Minneapolis. 
Two  weeks  later  that  most  perfect  picture  up  to 
now,  "Grand  Hotel,"  then  "Letty  Lynton," 


WHEW!  What  a  lot  of  Crawford 
controversy.  There's  no  doubt 
who  got  the  load  of  mail  this  month.  It 
was  that  girl  Joan.  PHOTOPLAY'S 
story  "The  Girl  With  the  Haunted  Face," 
in  which  Joan  expressed  her  opinions 
about  life  and  happiness  started  pens 
and  typewriters  going  all  over  the  world. 

The  battle  of  realism  versus  romance 
is  at  its  height.  And  the  audience  can't 
seem  to  get  together,  for  there  are  those 
who  believe  the  movie  theater  is  a  place 
for  glamorous  forgetfulness,  while  some 
say,  "Give  us  the  problems  of  everyday 
people."  The  final  judge  will  be  that 
all-seeing,  all-knowing  box-office. 

Warren  William's  popularity  builds 
like  a  Dietrich  closeup.  (Incidentally, 
his  last  name  is  William,  not  Williams.) 
But  Johnny  Weissmuller  continues  to  be 
among  the  head  men,  and  not  a  slam  in 
a  bag  full  of  mail.  Even  the  boys  like 
Johnny.  Clark  Gable  got  a  few  knocks 
this  month,  but  he's  still  getting  plenty 
of  boosts. 

"What  Price  Hollywood,"  "Rebecca 
of  Sunnybrook  Farm,"  "Bring  'Em  Back 
Alive,"  and  "Red-Headed  Woman" 
were  the  favorite  films.  The  folks  think 
that  Janet  Gaynor  made  a  mistake  in 
turning  down  "Rebecca,"  but  they  all 
agree  that  Marian  Nixon  was  perfectly 
suited  to  the  role. 


"As  You  Desire  Me,"  and  "Bring  'Em  Back 
Alive,"  the  great  animal  film.  This  week  we 
have  that  charming  little  actress.  Marian 
XLxon,  in  "Rebecca  of  Sunnybrook  Farm." 
There's  variety  for  you! 

We  had  just  as  great  a  variety  of  players — 
Paul  Muni,  Greta  Garbo  and  Marian  Xixon. 
So  why  kick? 

Let's  just  thrill  to  them  all  and  be  thankful 
we  can  see  such  great  players  in  such  great 
pictures.

"RED-HEADED  WOMAN" 

Jean  Harlow  has  gotten  a  real  break  at  last 

and  come  out  ahead  in  "  Red-Headed  Woman." 

I  like  those  flaming  locks  of  Miss  Harlow's  and 

really  believe  they  give  her  a  new  personality. 

Mrs.  Percy  Johnson,  Beaumont,  Texas 

Hollywood  breaks  a  precedent!  Chester 
Morris  is  cast  in  a  role  in  which  he  is  neither  a 
"bad  man"  nor  a  story-book  villain.  In  his 
new  garb  he's  the  same  old  Chester,  but  more 
likable  and  personable.  And  in  my  opinion  he 
steals  "Red-Headed  Woman"  from  Jean 
Harlow. 

Jasper  Sinclair,  San  Francisco,  Calif. 

WARREN  WILLIAM 

"Ultra-finesse" — that's  a  two- word  descrip- 
tion of  the  professional  qualities  of  Warren 
William. 

His  "Mouthpiece"  was  excellent.  "Dark 
Horse"  brought  forth  the  human  quality  this 
actor  can  put  into  his  work.  His  kind  are 
too  few  and  far  between — born  artists,  that 
neither  a  weak  story  nor  absurd  situations  can 
put  down.

AFTER    TOMORROW— Fox  —  You'll    like    this 
because  it  is  clean,  it  has  charm  and  is  sincerely  acted 
irlie  Farrell  and  Marian  Nixon.    (May) 

AIR  EAGLES — All-Star. — An  amusing  enough 
picture,  but  bigger  and  better  air  films  have  been 
made.     (April) 

•     ALIAS   THE    DOCTOR— First    National.— 
Now  it's  Richard  Barthelmess  who  glorifies  the 
medical  profession.    Rather  gruesome.    (April) 

AMATEUR  DADDY— Fox.— If  you  can  imagine 
Warner  Baxter  mothering  a  brood  of  orphaned  chil- 
dren you'll  enjoy  this.    Great  for  the  kids.    (May) 

•  ARE  YOU  LISTENING?— M-G-M.— Grand 
stuff  behind  the  scenes  of  a  broadcasting  com- 
pany with  Billy  Haines  doing  a  straight  dramatic

all  means.     (March)

sound). — Sound  effects  skilfully  added  to  an  old

BIG  TIMER.  THE— Columbia.— A  prize-fight 
yarn  with  lots  of  laughs.  Ben  Lyon  plays  a  "ham"

clean  fun.      (June)

BROKEN  WING,  THE— Paramount— Love  and 
adventure  below  the  Rio  Grande  with  Lupe  Velez, 
Leo  Carrillo  and  Melvyn  Douglas  playing  the  old 
hokum  exceptionally  well.    (May)

phisticated situations.  Bob  Montgomery  wisecracks 
and  you'll  remember  Heather  Thatcher,  Hollywood's 
only  woman  monocle  wearer.     (May) 

CAIN — Talking  Picture  Epics. — Although  not  as 
idyllic  as  "Tabu,"  this  modern  Robinson  Crusoe  story 
is  both  entertaining  and  beautiful.     (March)

charming  comedy  with  good  situations  and  John

CARNIVAL  BOAT— RKO-Pathe.  — Runaway

camp  melodrama  above  the  mediocre.     (May)

pace.     (March)

COUNTY  FAIR,  THE— Monogram.— Action  and

Jimmy  Dunn  hit  the  bull's-eye  once  more.  The

•  DARK  HORSE,  THE— First  National.— One 
of  the  funniest  films  in  years — a  political  satire

see  this.   (A  ug.) 

•     DESTRY   RIDES  AGAIN— Universal.— The

cutta Sweepstakes  find  themselves  together  under

len.     (May)

direction.      (June)

•  IMPATIENT  MAIDEN,  THE— Universal.— 
Lew  Ayree  thinks  he  should  make  a  "good 
woman"  of  Mae  Clarke  but  she  has  other  ideas.  So

the  last  chapter.      (A  ug.) 

LAW  AND  ORDER— Universal.— Entertaining

in  the  cast.      (May)

The  same  old  gun  play  and  hard  riding.  Bob  Steele.

tions in  old  Kentucky,  suh !  But  this  race  horse  story 
is  too  old-fashioned.     (July) 

•  LETTY  LYNTON— M-G-M.— A  gripping  tale 
with  Joan  Crawford  at  her  best,  as  Leily.  Nils 
Asther  is  a  fascinating  villain  and  Robert  Montgom-

ous picture.  It  becomes  so  involved  that  the  outcome

LOVE  IS  A  RACKET— First  National.— Doug 
Fairbanks,  Jr.,  as  a  chatter  columnist.  Good  work  by 
Doug,  Frances  Dee  and  Ann  Dvorak,  but  the  story  is 
weak.    (July)

ing songs  and  waltz  rhythms.  You  can  follow  the 
plot  whether  or  not  you  know  German.     (July)

old  story  done  beautifully  by  Bob  Montgomery

picture.     Decidedly  worth  your  while.     (March) 

MAN  WANTED— Warners.— A  new  twist  to  the 
"office  wife"  theme.  Lovely  Kay  Francis  is  boss  and 
David  Manners,  her  secretary.  Una  Merkel  and 
Andy  Devine  are  very  funny.     (June) 

MENACE,  THE— Columbia.— Recommended  for 
ardent  mystery  fans  only.     (April) 

•     MERRILY  WE  GO  TO  HELL— Paramount.

drunkard,  and  you'll  like  Sylvia  Sidney.     (Aug.)

than  this  slow  moving  English  film.  Wife  Edna  Best 
plays  opposite  him.     (March) 

MIDNIGHT  LADY,  THE— Chesterfield.— The

What  the  Audience  Thinks 


"Give  that  Bankhead  girl  a 
good  picture,"  wail  hundreds 
of  her  admirers.  All  say  they 
know  that  Tallulah  has  acting 
ability  and  glamour,  but  that 
films  like  "Thunder  Below" 
don't  do  the  Alabama  girl  jus- 
tice. That's  PaulLukas' profile 
in  this    still   from    the    film 


"WHAT  PRICE  HOLLYWOOD" 

For  the  first  time  in  her  life  Connie  Bennett 
really  acted  in  "What  Price  Hollywood." 
What  a  performance,  say  I.  She  forgot  her 
cultured  accent,  even  forgot  her  poise,  in  order 
to  play  the  role  of  that  cheap  but  good-hearted 
little  picture  star.  It  was  a  magnificent  job. 
Rose  Colfax,  St.  Paul,  Minn. 

Where  have  they  been  hiding  Lowell  Sher- 
man? To  my  notion  he  is  just  swell.  When  I 
saw  the  new  Bennett  film,  "What  Price  Holly- 
wood." Sherman  at  once  became  my  favorite. 
We  need  more  actors  like  him. 

Hazel  Fisher,  Houston,  Texas 

I've  seen  a  good  many  pictures  in  which 
Lowell  Sherman  appeared,  but  I  never  had  a 
good  word  for  him.    Since  seeing  him  in  "What 
Price  Hollywood,"  he  is  one  of  my  favorites. 
Miss  F.  Lewis,  Denver,  Colo. 

CL\RK  GABLE 

Every  time  I  sec  one  of  Clark  Gable's 
pictures  I  am  more  and  more  disappointed. 
The  women  fell  in  love  with  Gable  because  he 
was  the  big  he-man.  The  men  liked  him  be- 
lie did  things  they  would  like  to  do  but 
didn't  dare.  Then 'why  do  they  make  Clark 
Gable  a  gentle  lover  now?  Keep  hirr  a  cave- 
man. 

Norma  Larson,  Minneapolis,  Minn. 

Anyone  who  doesn't  realize  that  Clark  Gable 
is  wonderful  cannot  be  considered  capable  of 
having  good  judgment.  His  features  are  per- 
fect; his  smile  the  nicest  in  all  Hollywood;  his 
acting  is  superb. 

Kay  Wiialen,  Chicago,  111.

One  of  the  best  pictures  ever  produced  is 
"Rebecca  of  Sunnybrook  Farm."  The  story 
was  delightful,  but  it  was  improved  one 
hundred  per  cent  by  beautiful  scenery,  life-like 
characters  and  splendid  sound  reproduction. 
I  wish  we  might  have  more  pictures  like  this 
one.    .Marian  Nixon  was  a  vivid  Rebecca. 

R.  Whitney,  Plainfield,  N.  J. 

"Rebecca  of  Sunnybrook  Farm"  was  the 
favorite  book  of  my  childhood.  You  would 
never  have  recognized  the  book  from  the 
picture.  The  continuity  was  terrible.  A'' 
grew  up  faster  than  Jack's  proverbial  bean- 
stalk.   And  that  unrealistic  storm! 

But  I'm  going  to  see  the  picture  again  just 
for  the  acting  of  Louise  Closser  Hale.  There's 
an  actress. 

Mabel  Van  Tassell,  Newark,  Ohio. 

I'm  all  "het  up"  over  Marian  Nixon  and 
Ralph  Bellamy  in  "Rebecca  of  Sunnybrook 
Farm."  What  a  team!  You  can  have  your 
Gaynor-Farrell  and  Dressier-Beery  teams,  but 
give  me  Nixon  and  Bellamy. 

Marie  Ore,  Wichita  Falls,  Texas 

HE'S  A  HONEY! 

A  new  and  different  actor  has  captured  my 
heart.  It  is  the  honey-bear  in  Frank  Buck's 
"  Bring  'Em  Back  Alive."  There  was  more 
rebellion  in  the  way  he  left  the  camp  to  seek  ad- 
venture in  the  jungle  than  any  modern  youth 
depicted  on  the  screen  could  understand.  He 
learned  his  lesson,  too,  and  went  scurrying 
home. 

The  world  is  a  wonderful  place  to  live  in 
when  men  like  Frank  Buck  bring  back  true 
romance  and  drama  from  lands  we  stay-at- 
homes  cannot  visit. 

Mrs.  G.  S.  Petrik,  Pittsburgh,  Penna. 

REALISM  VERSUS  GLAMOUR 

I  want  movie  stories  about  the  kind  of  people 
I  know,  who  work  hard  trying  to  realize  decent 
ambitions.  I  want  to  see  their  struggles,  until 
at  last  they  win  or  lose.  If  they  lose,  I  am  in- 
terested in  seeing  how  they  take  it.  This  to  me 
is  what  life  is  all  about. 

But  instead  the  screen  lures  me  away  to  the 
South  Seas,  or  the  African  desert  or  the  under- 
world— all  of  which  has  as  much  to  do  with  me 
and  mine  as  the  valleys  of  the  moon. 

Virginia  Heathman,  St.  Louis,  Mo. 

I  get  a  great  kick  out  of  the  fans  who  beg  for 
"more  realistic  pictures."  I  take  it  that  they 
mean  a  picture  isn't  true  to  life  unless  it 
reflects  the  wickedness  of  humanity.  But 
aren't  there  people  who  live  perfectly  frivolous 
lives?  After  all,  it's  the  unusual  in  which  we 
are  interested. 

Samela  Parkhurst,  Seattle,  Wash. 

What  is  it  that  makes  the  outstanding  stars 
fascinating?  It  isn't  only  beauty.  That 
abounds  behind  department  store  counters. 
Charm?  Have  you  ever  seen  the  girls  on  a 
college  campus?  It  is  the  odd,  the  unusual 
that  attracts. 

Does  Garbo  look  like  the  girl  behind  the 
counter?  Is  Dietrich  like  the  pretty  telephone 
girl?  Mere  natural  prettiness  is  what  makes 
the  Mary  Brians  and  Dorothy  Jordans  color- 
less after  a  few  pictures.  They  have  no  unusual 
features,  no  exciting  glamour  to  refresh  our 
weary  eyes.  May  the  unusual  and  glamorous 
stars  continue  to  make  the  movies  the  glorious 
escape  they  are,  for  those  of  us  who  live  in  a 
less  colorful  world. 

D.  P.  Mitchell,  Vancouver,  B.  C. 


Why  do  all  the  stars  go  in  for  glamour?  The 
youth  of  America  has  been  fed  on  the  bottle  of 
sophistication — Hicktown  or  Hollywood,  it's 
all  the  same.  I'm  for  the  stars,  but  I  do  not 
like  affectation  and  neither  does  anyone  else, 
for  ncstar  can  do  earnest  work  when  hampered 
by  it. 

Mil-.  Vale  R.  Butler,  Franklin,  Ind. 

ATT  A  BOY,  BILL! 

I  just  arrived  from  Liverpool,  England. 
Until  then  I  had  considered  my  years  entitled 
me  to  sit  in  a  comfortable  arm  chair  while  my 
family  tucked  pillows  behind  my  back.  But, 
by  Jove,  what  do  my  little  Yankee  grand- 
children do  but  grab  me  by  the  arm,  bustle  me 
off  to  the  talkies  and  call  me  Bill! 

On  the  way  home  I  had  to  buy  a  copy  of 
Photoplay  so  I  could  find  out  for  myself  about 
these  screen  stars  the  youngsters  speak  of  as 
old  friends. 

A-  I  read  that  book  I  felt  as  if  I  had  entered 
an  enchanted  world  where  everyone  was 
beautiful  and  happy.  It  has  put  life  in  the  old 
boy. 

When  I  go  back  home,  instead  of  spending 
my  last  days  in  my  old  arm  chair,  I'll  be  sitting 
in  a  movie  theater,  thanks  to  a  couple  of  little 
Yankees  and  Photoplay. 

William  Slim,  Palmyra,  N.  J. 

OH,  DRY  THOSE  TEARS 

Why,  oh  why,  must  producers  give  us  close- 
ups  of  our  stars  weeping?  Such  scenes  look 
silly  and  sound  worse.  It  is  much  better  to  let 
them  cry  at  long  distance.  Movie  makers 
should  remember  that  the  American  people 
have  some  imagination. 

Robert  Keating,  Indianapolis,  Ind.

What  the  Audience  Thinks 


|  CONTINUED  PROM  PACE   12  , 


Wow!  What  a  storm  of  comment  "Red-Headed  Woman"  brought 
forth!  Some  thought  the  picture  was  too  frank,  others  said  it  was 
great  stuff,  but  everybody  agreed  that  Jean  Harlow,  red  hair  and  all, 
gave  the  performance  of  her  life.  Folks  were  surprised  that  Chester 
Morris  could  play  a  straightforward  business  man  without  a  single  leer 


TRUE  PERSONALITIES 

I  have  great  respect  and  admiration  for  the 
stars  who  have  adapted  or  changed  their  per- 
sonalities to  suit  the  blase  and  sophisticated 
roles  that  seem  to  be  demanded  at  present, 
thus  being  able  to  keep  in  the  swim  amidst  the 
keen  competition  of  the  younger  players.  How- 
ever, I  always  will  have  a  warm  spot  in  my 
heart  for  the  stars  who,  despite  the  trend  to- 
ward sophistication,  have  had  the  courage  to 
retain  their  true  personalities.  I  refer  to  such 
players  as  Ramon  Novarro,  Richard  Barthel- 
mess,  Harold  Lloyd,  Jean  Hersholt,  Marian 
Xixon,  Charles  Chaplin,  Tom  Mix  and  ZaSu 
Pitts. 

Ida  Raech,  New  Glarus,  Wis. 

JOAN  CRAWFORD 

I  think  Joan  Crawford  is  a  wonderful  actress 
and  never  miss  one  of  her  pictures,  but  after 
reading  "The  Girl  With  the  Haunted  Face"  in 
the  July  Photoplay,  I  can't  help  wondering 
what  it  takes  to  make  a  movie  star  happy. 
Joan  makes  more  money  per  week  than  most 
people  make  in  a  year.  She  has  come  up  from 
obscurity  to  one  of  the  top  places  in  the  picture 
industry.  But  she  is  still  searching.  She  is 
taking  herself  much  too  seriously. 

Mrs.  W.  B.  Edman,  Stratford,  Calif. 

Joan  Crawford  should  stop  thinking  so  much 
of  Joan  Crawford  and  take  more  of  the  "be 
yourself"  medicine  prescribed  by  Lupe  Velez. 
Lupe  has  not  a  fourth  of  Joan's  acting  ability, 
but  she  is  liked  by  almost  everybody  for  her 
naturalness. 

I  am  in  hopes  something  can  be  done  about 
Joan's  unhappy  mental  attitude. 

Mrs.  Marion  McClaix,  Chicago,  1U. 

Joan  Crawford  has  shown  me  that  where 
there's  a  will,  there's  a  way.  She  is  my  in- 
spiration. 

Xola  Champion,  Wichita,  Kan. 

u 


We  never  attend  a  Joan  Crawford  picture, 
although  we  admire  her  ability,  because  we  do 
not  care  to  place  before  the  children  the  idea 
that  the  only  way  society  people  can  amuse 
themselves  is  by  drinking  and  smoking.  Janet 
Gaynor  gives  them  much  lovelier  surround- 
ings. 

Vivian  Farley,  Valley  Ford,  Calif. 

HERE'S  YOUR  ANSWER,  JANET 

What's  this  I  hear  about  our  darling  Janet 
Gaynor  wanting  to  go  sophisticated?  It  can't 
be  true.  If  she  only  knew  how  much  we  ap- 
preciate and  enjoy  her  adorable,  unaffected 
acting  and  the  simple  but  sweet  happy-ending 
pictures  she  plays  in,  perhaps  she  would  change 
her  mind.  We  do  get  so  tired  of  this  heavy 
acting  and  tragedy  stuff.  We  want  our  Janet 
just  as  she  is. 

Betty  Edwards,  San  Francisco,  Calif. 


HOW  YOU  "GONNA"  FEND  'EM? 

Jackie  Cooper  and  his  pals  may  be  all  very 
well  as  a  type,  but  why  can't  we  also  have  op 
the  screen  some  clever,  well-bred  boys  and  girls 
with  cultivated  voices  and  pleasant  refined 
manners?  Instead,  our  ears  are  pierced  with 
strident  tones  and  ungrammatical  crudities  of 
speech  such  as  "gotta"  and  "gonna"  and  our 
eyes  disgusted  with  unkempt  locks  and  a 
slovenly,  unmannerly  appearance  generally. 

A  certain  class  of  Americans  seem  to  think 
that  one  must  be  as  crude  and  ungrammatical 
as  Will  Rogers  to  be  considered  a  typical 
American.  Heaven  help  them!  If  they  only 
knew  what  people  outside  of  the  U.  S.  A.  think 
of  such  specimens. 

There  is,  I  am  thankful  to  say,  a  large  class 
of  Americans  of  another  type  who  would  be 
more  glad  to  hear  cultivated  children  in  bright, 
cultured  plays.    All  children  are  not  brought 


up   on    rubbish   heaps.      Will    film   producers 
please  take  notki ■! 

K.  DOUGLAS,  Theresa,  X.  Y. 

""WESTWARD  PASSAGE" 

The  worst  picture  I  have  seen  this  year  is 
"Westward  Passage."  What  a  shock  to  see 
our  Ann  Harding  taking  the  part  of  a  flighty, 
irresponsible  blonde — our  Ann  who  is  all 
beauty,  charm  and  dignity.  Any  more  pictures 
like  that  and  Ann  Harding  won't  be  a  head- 
liner. 

Gertrude  Blasch,  Philadelphia,  Penna. 

"  Westward  Passage"  with  Ann  Harding  was 
a  bitter  disappointment.  Margaret  Ayet 
Barnes'  story  is  absolutely  perfect  in  its  original 
form  for  talkie  fare,  having  a  logical  ending 
that  is  a  knock-out  for  suspense  and  origi- 
nality. But  the  movie-makers  must  butcher  it, 
making  it  silly  and  unbelievable. 

Xeither  was  I  satisfied  with  Ann  Harding  in 
the  role  of  the  modern,  sophisticated  0 
Never  once  in  the  picture  did  she  look  smart  or 
up-to-date. 

Dorothy  Edmondson,  East  Mauch  Chunk, 

Penna. 

HOW  ABOUT  IT,  SYLVIA? 

I  understand  that  Clara  Bow's  successful 
comeback  depends  upon  whether  she  can 
reduce  sufficiently  or  not.  Why  must  she.  like 
so  many  actresses,  have  to  possess  that  very 
slim  Crawford  figure?  Personally  I  would 
enjoy  seeing  a  plump,  snappy,  healthy  looking 
little  actress  once  again  on  the  screen.  I  am 
sure  that  a  plump  Clara  Bow  would  be  a  very 
pleasant  contrast  to  those  thin,  snaky  women 
now  so  plentiful  in  the  movies. 

Eleanor  Dahl,  Columbia  Lake,  Conn. 


"What  Price  Hollywood" 
gave  the  fans  something  to 
write  to  Photoplay  about. 
People  who  had  never  liked 
Connie  Bennett's  work  be- 
fore threw  their  hats  into  the 
air  and  cheered  when  this 
picture  came  to  town.  And 
as  for  Lowell  Sherman  — 
well,  he  was  a  real  sensation

Help   keep   youthful    energy 
with  these  "better  bran  flakes" 


MANY  a  time,  today,  you'll  see  a  mother 
teaching  her  daughter  the  first  strokes  of 
golf,  tennis,  and  swimming. 

Modern  women  stay  active.  That's  why 
they  retain  their  youth  and  charm.  And 
they've  learned  an  important  lesson  —  to 
eat  wisely  and  healthfully. 

Whole  wheat  is  the  natural  food  for  ac- 
tive people.  Nature  has  made  it  a  store- 
house of  iron  and  other  minerals,  of  vita- 
mins and  proteins.  All  the  food  value  of 
whole  wheat  is  waiting  for  you  in  Kellogg's 
PEP  Bran  Flakes.  Plus  a  wonderful  flavor. 
And  healthful  regulating  bran. 

Have  them  often — for  breakfast, 
luncheon,  a  bedtime  snack.  Let  the  whole 
family  enjoy  their  matchless  taste. 

Made  by  Kellogg  in  Battle  Creek.  Sold 
at  all  grocers  in  the  red-and-green  package. 
Quality  guaranteed.

Chafing  Dish  Recipes 


Genevieve  Stirs 

Up  Some  Tasty 

Morsels 


Genevieve  Tobin  believes 
that  the  chafing  dish  is  a 
great  boon  to  entertain- 
ing. You  can  indulge  your 
own  particular  flair  for 
mixing  up  interesting  con- 
coctions, and  dishes  are 
kept  hot  so  that  none  of 
the  flavor  is  lost  at  second 
helpings.  There  are  al- 
ways second  helpings  at 
the  Tobin  home!  Try 
these  new  ideas  and  see 


IF  you  have  ever  dined  at  a  Japanese  restaurant,  you  probably 
have  yearned  to  stir  around  with  a  spoon  in  some  of  those 
savory  dishes  that  cook  right  there  in  front  of  you.  Gene- 
vieve Tobin  contends  that  half  the  fun  of  chafing  dish 
recipes  is  the  fact  that  you  can  put  a  spoon  in  the  proceedings 
whenever  you  like  it.  When  she  was  on  the  stage,  she  liked 
to  eat  late  at  night — thus  her  chafing  dish  habit. 

Genevieve  is  generous  about  her  pet  recipes.  Several  old 
Tobin  favorites,  therefore,  are  about  to  be  given  to  you  for 
personal  experimentation. 

There's  Savory  Lobster — a  dish  tempting  beyond  description. 
You  do  not  need  to  have  fresh  lobster  at  hand  to  make  this. 
Merely  take  the  lobster  meat  Jrom  two  small  cans.  Heat  your 
chafing  dish  and  melt  three  tablespoons  of  butter  in  it.  When 
melted,  add  the  lobster  and  saute  for  several  minutes.  Add 
salt  and  pepper,  a  dash  of  cayenne,  a  teaspoon  of  dry  mustard 
and  a  small  cup  of  Sherry  flavoring.  Let  this  whole  concoction 
simmer  in  the  dish  until  the  juices  are  just  sufficient  to  cover 
the  pan. 

This  dish  is  then  served  on  pieces  of  toast.  Genevieve  de- 
clares that  it  seems  like  a  very  complicated  dish  to  guests,  but 
actually  it  requires  little  fuss. 

Spaghetti  Creole  is  another  rich  but  delicious  chafing  dish  recipe 
from  the  Tobin  cook  book.  It 
requires  a  little  preparation  be- 
forehand in  the  kitchen,  but  the 
last  steps  can  be  dramatically 
done  in  a  chafing  dish.  The 
spaghetti  is  cooked  thoroughly 
in  the  kitchen  and  brought  onto 
the  table  in  a  deep  covered  dish 
to  keep  it  warm.  Then  a  Creole 
sauce,  also  started  in  the  kitchen, 
is  placed  close  at  hand.  The 
spaghetti  is  placed  in  the  heated 
chafing  dish,  butter  having 
already  been  melted  therein. 
When  this  is  thoroughly  heated, 
the  sauce  is  poured  over  it  and 
the  whole  is  allowed  to  simmer 
for  several  minutes. 


SAUCE  CREOLE 


2  tablespoons  of  butter 
]/2  green  chopped  pepper 
2  tablespoons  chopped  onion 
1  tablespoon  flour 
Yl  cup  chopped  celery 


2  cups  canned  tomatoes 

4  tablespoons  chopped  cooked 

ham 
Chopped  parsley 
Salt  Pepper 


Cook  the  onion  in  the  butter  and  then  sprinkle  flour  over  it. 
Quickly  stir  in  the  tomatoes,  pepper  and  celery.  Let  this 
simmer  for  about  twenty  minutes.  Then  add  the  ham,  parsley 
and  seasoning.  Keep  this  hot  until  you  pour  it  over  the 
spaghetti  in  the  chafing  dish. 

Have  you  ever  tasted  tomato  rarebit?  It  is  a  marvelous 
mixture  done  in  the  best  Tobin  manner.

cheese,  sliced  in  thin  pieces,  also 
the  salt.  Cook  this  until  it

REALSILK 
*        *        * 

Adela  Rogers  St.  Johns  was  right  and  we 
are  printing  some  of  the  interesting  points 
of  her  letter  to  form  this  advertisement. 


./ 


"There  are  many  women  in  Hollywood," 
she  writes,  "who  invest  thousands  a  year  in 
their  wardrobes  as  part  of  their  business. 
They  want  the  best  at  any  price.  Realsilk 
stockings  are  brought  to  them  right  in  their 
homes  and  studios. 

"One  of  the  best  dressed  actresses  on  the 
screen  buys  most  everything  she  wears  in 
Paris,  except  her  stockings.  She  told  me  she 
sees  no  reason  to  go  to  Paris  for  her  hosiery 
when  Realsilk  brings  such  exquisite  stock- 
ings right  to  her. 

"There  are  many  other  girls  who  must  look 
well,  but  haven't  a  lot  of  money  to  spend  on 
it.  I  find  most  of  them  wear  Realsilk  stock- 
ings, too. 

"A  certain  very  temperamental  star  was  al- 
ways flying  into  tantrums  about  runs  in  her 
stockings.  When  she  complained  to  me  one 
day  I  told  her  the  way  to  cure  those  runs  was 
to  try  the  fresh  silk  kind  —  the  ones  that 
haven't  lain  around  shelves  getting  older  and 
older  and  weaker  and  weaker.  That's  why 
she  switched  to  Fresh  Realsilk. 
"One  day  I  called  at  the  beautiful  home  of 
one  of  our  favorite  actresses  to  interview  her 
for  a  screen  magazine.  What  do  you  think  I 
found  her  doing?  Washing  stockings  in  the 
bathroom  and  hanging  them  up  on  the 
shower  rod,  even  as  you  and  I ! 
"One  actress  when  she  first  entered  themovies, 
absolutely  refused  to  wear  stockings.  The 
directors  insisted  and  she  got  her  hosiery 
baptism  with  Realsilk. 


Stars  of  Hollywood!  Who  knows  more  about  them  than  Adela  Rogers  St.  Johns?  In  books,  magazines 
and  newspapers  she  has  reported  Hollywood  People  and  Hollywood  Happenings  since  the  movies 
were  young.  She  is  also  a  prominent  fiction  writer,  scenarist,  and  the  mother  of  three  children! 
Her    most    recent    film    story    is    RKO's     "What     Price     Hollywood,"    starring     Constance     Bennett. 


"Another  famous  star  making  a  triumphant 
personal  appearance  tour  found  she  was  run- 
ning low  on  stockings  and  ordered  them  from 
Realsilk  to  be  delivered  in  another  city  1000 
miles  away.  They  were  waiting  for  her  when 
she  arrived. 

"Getting  down  to  my  own  case,  I  seemed  to 
be  haunted  by  hosiery  bad  luck  until  a  couple 
of  years  ago,  when  an  exuberant  young  man 
came  bursting  into  my  office.  I  didn't  believe  a 
word  he  said.  What  difference  did  it  make  if 
the  stockings  were  fresh  because  they  were  'di- 
rect from  the  mills.'  As  for  the  idea  that  they 
would  actually  wear — that  they'd  keep  their 
shape  and  a  straight  seam  up  the  back — I  sim- 
ply pooh-poohed  the  suggestion. 

"Because  I  was  desperate  about  stockings — be- 
cause 1  know  you  can't  climb  the  ladder  of  suc- 
cess with  runs  in  your  hosiery — because  it  was 
a  timesaver  not  to  have  to  go  down-town — 
because  he  showed  me  many  orders  of  motion 
picture  friends  of  mine  who  had  both  good 
taste  and  sound  business  sense — I  ordered  some. 

"Everything  that  salesman  told  me  was  true.  I 
like  fresh  silk  stockings  and  I  like  those  seven 
Realsilk  features.  Realsilk  put  elegance  and 
comfotton  my  feet  and  took  a  load  off  my  mind. 


They  make  the  going  a  lot  smoother — which  is 
mighty  important  in  our  busy  lives  out  here." 

Of  course  we've  been  asleep 

It  took  Adela  Rogers  St.  Johns  to  open  our  eyes  to  our 

own  stockings! 

But  we  sense  a  great  advertising  campaign  in  the  bits 

of  gossip  she's  given  us.  So  ue're  going  to  tell  you  of 

the  adventures  of  Realsilk 's  Fresh  Silk  stockings  in 

Hollywood. 

Fresh  Silk  stockings  are  made  possible  only  because 

Realsilk,  by  sending  hosiery  direct-from-the-mills, 

saves  so  much  time  over  the  ordinary  method.  And 

Fresh  Silk  is  only  one  of  Realsilk 's  seven  exclusive 

features  of  extra  beauty  and  extra  uear.

YOU  must  have  glamour  to  be  a  big  star,"  a  producer  said  recently. 
Oh,  yeah?  Well,  look  at  Helen  Hayes,  a  simple,  natural,  charming 
little  actress  who,  even  without  great  beauty,  became  one  of  the  out' 
standing  screen  sensations.  She  has  just  plucked  a  prise  film  plum — the 
role  of  the  nurse  in  "Farewell  to  Arms."    Gary  Cooper  plays  the  soldier

WHEN  Bette  Davis  first  came  to 
Hollywood,  they  looked  at  her 
demure,  pale  face  and  said,  "Uh-huh, 
she'll  be  okay  for  colorless  supporting 
roles,  but  that's  all."  Now,  the  same 
lads  who  said  that  are  lying  awake 
nights  wondering  why  they  didn't  see 
all  that  sophistication  she  let  loose  in 
"The  Rich  Are  Always  With  Us." 
And  our  Answer  Man  has  just  rushed 
in  to  announce  that  Bette  had  drawn 
more  letters  asking  about  her  than 
any   other    three    stars    this    month 


PRESENTING  Hollywood's  ftief 
topic  of  conversation — big  George 
Brent !  And  the  question  was,  "If  he's 
supposed  to  be  in  love  with  Ruth 
Chatterton,  why  has  he  been  casting 
those  tender  glances  at  Loretta  Young?" 
Here's  the  lowdown.  George  and 
Loretta  were  rehearsing  for  a  vaudeville 
skit.  But  Ruth  is  still  his  first  lady  and 
we're  taking  small  bets — just  as  small 
as  possible — that  when  her  divorce 
from  Ralph  Forbes  is  an  actuality, 
it's  wedding  bells  for  her  and  George

YES,  sir,  we  had  to  look  twice  to  make  sure — but  it's  really  Colleen 
Moore.  Didn't  we  tell  you  that  the  pert  little  minx  had  pushed 
back  her  straight  bangs,  beaded  her  eyelashes  and  gone  glamorous? 
Not  so  long  ago  Colleen  felt  that  films  didn't  want  her.  Now  she  is 
sitting  pretty — as  this  picture  testifies — with  an  M'G-M  contract

LISTEN  to  the  sad  story  of  Kay  Francis.  With  grips  packed  and 
passage  booked  on  an  ocean  liner,  she  and  her  director-husband, 
Kenneth  MacKenna,  were  Europe  bound  when — just  like  a  movie — 
came  a  wire  from  Hollywood.  "Return  at  once.  You're  scheduled  for 
three  pictures."     But  Kay  thinks  that  it's  good  to  be  wanted,  anyhow

OVERHEARD  at  the  Para-

I 


HAVE  just  seen  "Scarface" 
for  the  second  time — thegang- 
ster  film  to  end  all  gangster  films  and  I've  been  walk- 
ing out  in  the  middle  of  the  street  ever  since.  I'm 
afraid  this  guy  Paul  Muni  might  be  lurking  in  the 
shadows. 

What's  more,  I've  been  going  around  mumbling  to 
anybody  who'd  listen  to  me,  "What's  to  be  done  about 
it?  Are  we,  the  American  public,  going  to  stand  by 
and  witness  scenes  like  this  enacted  before  our  very 
eyes? 

"S?arface"  made  me  go  civic  with  a  bang — the 
bang  of  a  machine  gun. 


FOR  producer  Howard  Hughes,  director  Lewis  Mile- 
stone and  actor  Paul  Muni  have  done  something 
that  has  never  been  done  in  any  other  gangster  film. 
They  have,  I  believe,  ensnared  the  elusive  and  gory 
spirit  of  the  monster. 

Paul  Muni  gets  into  the  mind  of  the  gangster.  He 
sees  him — not  as  a  glamorous,  shrewd,  exciting  per- 
sonality— but  as  a  half-mad  killer,  a  man  set  apart 
from  other  men. 

He  sees  him  also  as  the  criminal  moron  he  is.  And, 
again,  he  makes  him  a  coward — which  most  pictures 
have  neglected  to  do. 

He  dies  yellow. 

The  rigid  code  of  the  underworld,  which  has  been 
glorified  and  romanticized  by  other  pictures,  falls 
apart  in  this  one.  There  is,  here,  no  code  but  the 
code  of  brutality. 

I  do  not  know  whether  or  not  Paul  Muni  has  a 
wide  acquaintance  in  gangster  circles,  but  I'd  be 
willing  to  bet  all  my  winnings  at  backgammon  that 
he  has  done  some  very  clever  inside  research  and  that 
the  character  of  Tony  is  as  true  as  Lily  Pons'  high  C. 

There's  a  picture  that  won't  undermine  the  youth 
of  the  country.  This  is  the  truth — and  truth  never 
hurt  anybody.

A  MAJOR  studio  has  gone  in  for  salary  slashing 
in  a  big  way.  Or  maybe  you'd  call  it  a  small 
way.  There  is  no  record  of  any  executive  getting 
teas  on  his  four  figured  salary  each  week,  but  the  boys 
in  the  mail  rooms  have  been  slashed  from  their 
eighteen  dollars  weekly  to  thirteen  dollars  weekly. 
And  some  with  mothers  to  support.  The  stenog- 
raphers wear  a  brave  little  smile  that  doesn't  fool 
anybody — what  with  white  scared  faces  and  red  eyes. 
From  twenty-five  dollars  a  week  to  eighteen  dollars 
is  quite  a  cut.  And  from  their  windows  they  can  lift 
weary  eyes  from  their  typing  and  watch  thousands 
of  dollars  wasted  each  and  every  day.  Even  the 
actors  are  incensed  about  it ,  but  nobody  seems  to  be 
able  to  do  anything  about  it.  It's  the  way  of  the 
movies.  Always  has  been,  and  probably  always  will 
be.  Or  maybe  it's  the  way  of  the  New  York  bankers 
in  Hollywood. 

THE  statisticians,  after  sharpening  their  pencils 
and  calling  on  the  office  boys  to  carry  in  a  good 
load  of  nice,  white  paper,  have  been  doing  a  lot  of 
figuring. 

Cuts  in  the  costs  of  operating  the  picture  industry 
are  estimated  to  run  to  eighteen  million  dollars  a  year. 
This  covers  all  departments,  and  the  branches  abroad, 
too.  And  in  response  to  the  cry  of  some  financial 
backers,  "Economize  till  it  hurts"  (somebody  else), 
salaries  of  players  have  also  been  knocked  down. 

But  some  salaries,  like  a  good  man,  won't  stay  down 
long.  In  many  instances  they  are  said  to  have  bounced 
right  back  again,  because  you  can't  make  a  man  radiate 
histrionic  enthusiasm  by  curtailing  his  pay  check. 

That's  just  plain  human  nature,  with  no  blame  at- 
tached. 


THIS  holds,  of  course,  only  for  those  players  who 
bring  in  the  customers.     There's  another  side  to 
the  situation. 

The  most  pathetic  sight  in  Hollywood  are  the 
former  well  known  players  who  are  forced,  by  reason 
of  hard  times  and  waning  popularity,  to  play  bits  and 
atmosphere.  The  other  day  one  of  them  turned 
gratefully  to  the  director  and  thanked  him  for  letting 
him  stand  with  his  back  close  to  the  camera. 


AGAIN,  we  repeat  that  making  pictures  is  not  all 
jL\.a.  bed  of  gold  coins.  Take  Barbara  Stanwyck 
and  that  burning  wheat  field  in  "The  Purchase  Price." 

They  had  her  covered  with  sunburn  lotion  and  they 
had  men,  hidden  from  the  eye  of  the  camera,  keeping 
the  flames  down  with  wet  blankets.  But  still  she  got 
burned.     Arms  and  legs. 

But  she  kept  right  on  running.  And  she  made  the 
scene  several  times.  Finished  the  day.  It  would 
have  cost  many  thousands  of  extra  dollars  had  she 
stopped. 

But  she  spent  the  next  three  days  in  bed — covered 
with  baking-soda.

DOX'T  get  a  divorce  until  you  see  'The  Wet 
Parade.'" 

"Don't  get  married  until  you  see  'The  Wet  Parade.' " 

These  are  just  two  advertisements  quoted  directly 
from  sign-boards  in  Los  Angeles  while  "The  Wet 
Parade"  is  running  at  a  Hollywood  theater. 

And  they  are  moaning  about  the  poor  business  the 
picture  is  doing. 

Ho,  hum,  "The  Wet  Parade"  has  nothing  to  do 
with  divorce  or  marriage.  It  is  an  exciting  story 
wrapped  around  the  drink  problem. 

Might  we  modestly  suggest  that  honesty  in  adver- 
tising might  help  that  picture  a  little? 

"Do  you  believe  in  prohibition  or  don't  you?"  is  a 
review  in  one  line.  Perhaps  the  public  likes  to  know 
what  they  are  seeing.     Maybe  not. 


CLEVER  little  people,  those  English !  Variety  says 
that  the  London  censors  have  figured  out  a  way 
to  revise  the  title  of  the  Fredric  March-Sylvia  Sidney 
picture,  "Merrily  We  Go  to  Hell,"  which  is  strictly 

forbidden  as  it  stands.     "Merrily  We  Go  to "  is 

the  suggested  substitution. 


IX  Wales  a  visitor  found  that  miners  out  of  work 
and  dependent  upon  the  dole  were  patronizing  the 
"cinemas"  whenever  they  could,  and  at  an  admit- 
tance price  of  a  shilling.  That's  about  twenty  cents 
a  head. 

Sounds  like  a  lot  of  money  for  men  who  are  drawing 
but  four  to  five  dollars  a  week  and  supporting  families, 
too.  But  that  fact  shows  how  vital  this  recreation  is 
to  them. 

They  used  to  say  that  Henry  Ford's  low-priced  car 
had  probably  shunted  revolution  away  from  this  rest- 
less world.  If  not  that  it  did  replace  unhealthy  intro- 
spection with  contentment  and  happiness. 

Similarly,  the  cinemas  are  stabilizing  British  minds 
in  the  trying  economic  period  they  are  going  through. 


UP  pops  a  new  business  in  the  film  colony.  As 
we  told  you  a  few  months  ago  in  Photoplay. 
Hollywood  children  who  have  famous  actor  fathers 
or  mothers  are  zealously  guarded  at  all  times. 

Xow  ex-Federal  investigators  propose  a  system  that 
will  aid  in  recovering  the  child  if  by  some  unforeseen 
chance  a  kidnapper  should  slip  through  the  intricate 
protective  net  and  make  a  get  away. 

Parents  are  asked  to  have  the  finger  prints  of  their 
children  registered,  together  with  other  identifying 
data.  Then  in  case  of  a  kidnapping,  police  every- 
where will  be  able  to  check  back  if  they  arrest  a  sus- 
pect with  a  child  that  resembles  the  description  that 
has  been  broadcast. 

It  seems  to  be  a  good  idea,  but  let's  hope,  for  the 
peace  of  mind  of  parents,  that  its  efficacy  will  never 
have  to  be  put  to  the  test.

procured  from  trappings  once  worn  by  his  cannibalistic

thought  him  a  good  Friday.  When  he  learned  the  fellow 
was  a  cannibal,  Doug  decided  he  was  probably  Friday

wore,  but  what  at  some  time  or  another  he  had  eaten  a

A  WOMAN  past  sixty 
years  old  is  the  most 
beloved  figure  before 
the  world  today. 

Why? 

Beauty  is  not  hers,  and  per- 
haps never  was,  as  the  world 
judges  beauty. 

Youth  has  gone  from  her,  if 
you  look  upon  youth  as  a  thing 
of  the  flesh. 

Yet  this  woman  holds  hearts,  stirs  audiences,  thrills  millions 
as  no  gorgeous  beauty  of  the  screen  has  ever  done. 

We  grant  you  that  she  is  a  great  artist.  But  there  have  been 
other  great  artists  from  time  to  time.  They  have  been  applaud- 
ed but  never  loved  as  this  woman  is  loved. 

What  is  the  reason  that  men  and  women  and  children 
everywhere  feel  a  deep  warmth,  a  tear  and  a  chuckle,  a  hot 
loyalty,  at  the  sight  of  Marie  Dressler's  face  and  the  sound  of 
her  name? 

It  is  very  simple. 

Through  that  art  of  hers,  through  the  age  which  she  carries 
so  proudly,  through  the  rugged  face,  shines  a  great  soul.  And 
as  the  surface  of  a  lake  mirrors  the  glory  of  the  sun,  we  mirror 
back  to  her  the  love  that  she  has  for  humanity. 

Next  month  it  is  my  privilege  to  tell  you  the  life  philosophy 
of  the  woman  who  at  sixty  reached  her  greatest  heights  and 
achieved  a  fame  unsurpassed  in  all  motion  picture  history. 
To  tell  you  what  she  thinks.  To  look  into  that  mellow,  tender 
heart  and  that  shrewd,  dynamic  brain  and  find  what  sixty 
years  of  living  have  meant. 

When  I  first  went  to  Marie  Dressier  and  asked  her  to  do 
this  story,  the  story  of  her  life  philosophy,  she  said  "no."   And

she  said  it  in  no  mean  fashion. 
She  glared  at  me.  She  started 
talking  to  herself,  which  is  a 
habit  she  has. 

"Got  so  much  to  do  now  I 
never  get  to  sit  down  from 
morning  till  night,"  she  mut- 
tered. "Think  I  didn't  have 
anything  to  do.  Philosophy! 
Go  away.  I'm  too  busy." 
She  didn't  mention  the  fact — 
she  never  mentions  it — -that  she  has  been  desperately  ill.  Oh, 
she's  better.  She's  really  almost  well  again.  But  she  gave  us 
a  few  very  anxious  hours  not  long  ago,  when  we  wondered  if 
we  should  ever  see  that  smile  and  hear  that  chuckle  on  the 
screen  again. 


don't  think   I'm 
or  anything  like 

Marie   squirmed. 


WELL,   I   decided   not  to  go  away.    I 
particularly  eloquent  and  persuasive 
that.     But  I  knew  I  had  Marie  on  the  spot. 

Casually,   I   mentioned   the   depression. 

It  was  not  so  very  long  ago  that  her  close  friend  and  secre- 
tary, Claire  duBrey,  found  Marie  sitting  at  her  desk,  weeping 
bitterly.  It  was  the  first  time  Claire  had  ever  seen  that  fine 
head  bowed  and  she  rushed  to  her.  Upon  the  desk  were 
letters  by  the  thousands.  Before  Marie  was  an  open  check- 
book. "I  can't  do  it,"  she  said.  "They  want  so  much.  So 
many  of  them — and  it's  breaking  my  heart." 

That  was  quite  true.  Marie,  like  an  idiot,  was  taking  upon 
herself  the  burden  of  all  her  thousands  of  fan  letters.  Every 
mother  that  wrote  her  a  plea  for  her  kids,  every  little  girl  with 
a  broken  romance,  every  family  that  needed  help.  And  Marie 
received  thousands  of  fan  letters  everv  daw 


"I'm  an  old  fool, 
Adela.  I  haven't 
the  time,  but  I'll  do 
it.  I'll  help  you 
write  my  story  if 
you  think  it  will 
help  others.  I  don't 
know  much  about 
philosophy,  honey, 
but  I  do  know  life"

As  Told  By 

Adela  Rogers 
St.  Johns 


At  last  she  had  to  give  it  up.  It  was  one  of  the  causes  of  her 
breakdown.  No  one  in  the  world  could  have  met  the  demand, 
spiritually  or  financially.  And  to  Marie  it  was  a  constantly 
increasing   agony. 

I  mentioned,  too,  the  thing  I  have  seen  so  much  of  late — 
the  hurt  and  confusion  and  bewilderment  of  young  people 
going  through  their  first  hard  times.  And  I  told  her  how  on 
every  hand  I  saw  men  and  women  who  had  lost  their  moorings 
and  loosened  their  grasp  on  hope.  How,  having  sailed  so 
easily  and  gaily  the  high  seas  of  prosperity  with  a  philosophy, 
often  without  a  God,  they  had  no  pilot  to  steer  them,  no  course 
to  follow,  through  the  heavy  seas  of  these  latter  days. 

I  told  her  of  the  pitiful  lack  of  courage  I  had  seen  and  the 
bitterness  and  rebellion  that  burned  in  many  hearts. 

""\y~0\J  can  help  them,"  I  said.     "You've  lived  a  full  and 

J-  wonderful  life.  You've  been  up — and  you've  been  down. 
You've  had  everything  and  you've  had  nothing.  You  have 
conquered  age,  broken  down  tradition.  You  have  lived  and 
loved  and  suffered.  You  have  found  happiness.  You  ought 
to  tell  other  people  how  you  have  done  these  things.  They 
love  you  and  they  will  listen." 

She  sat  for  a  long  time,  looking  out  over  her  garden.  Her 
face  was  grave.     There  was  grandeur  in  it. 

I  thought — gee,  she's  a  swell  person.  There  are  not  many 
like  her.  She  makes  you  feel  good.  Troubles  don't  look  very 
big.  Get  your  confidence  back,  while  you're  talking  to  her. 
Life  warms  up.  It's  good  to  be  with  her.  Her  eyes  are  so 
bright.  Why,  she's  younger  and  more  beautiful  than  any 
woman  I  know.  I  love  to  look  at  her.  That's  because  beauty 
is  a  thing  of  the  spirit.  And  youth  is  a  thing  of  the  heart, 
superior  to  all  the  stupid  ills  of  the  flesh. 

I  had  an  uplifted  feeling,  as  though  I  could  run  miles. 


When  she  looked  up,  she  was  smiling.  No  one  I  know  can 
be  as  gay  as  Marie. 

"I'm  an  old  fool,"  she  said.  "I  haven't  the  time — but  I'll 
do  it.  Why,  you've  got  to  be  a  fighter,  honey.  Don't  folks 
know  that?  Everybody  gets  socked.  Why,  I've  been — all 
right,  all  right,  I'll  do  it.  If  I'd  tend  to  my  own  business  I 
wouldn't  be  so  tired  all  the  time." 

"You  love  it,"  I  said,  "you  know  perfectly  well  that  you 
love  it.  You'd  be  furious  if  you  found  yourself  living  a  placid, 
sane,  easy  existence  somewhere  in  the  backwater." 

The  twinkle  deepened.  She  winked  at  me.  And  we  both 
howled  with  laughter. 

"  I  know,"  she  said.  Then  she  hesitated  and  a  look  almost  of 
humility  came  across  her  face.  "Do  you  think  I  can  really 
help?  I  am  not  a  philosopher.  I.am  just — a  woman.  I'm  not 
a  student.  I  don't  know  any  big  words.  I  haven't  any  grand 
phrases.  I  have  never  deliberately  thought  it  all  out — we  must 
put  it  down  just  as  it  comes." 

And  do  you  know,  for  just  a  minute,  I  was  blind  with  tears. 
I  do  not  see  very  much  of  that  exquisite  virtue — humility — in 
my  daily  travels.  So  she  promised.  For  the  first  time,  to  set 
down  with  me  all  that  life  has  meant  to  her,  all  that  it  has 
taught  her,  what  she  has  learned  in  sixty  years  of  life  and  love 
and  laughter — for  she  has  spent  forty-seven  years  in  the  cause 
of  laughter.  But  to  gain  the  uplift,  the  practical  wisdom, 
the  renewed  hope,  the  happiness  of  that  philosophy,  you 
must  know  the  woman  who  speaks. 

What  manner  of  woman  is  this,  who  has  in  her  own  life 
achieved  that  magnificent  poetry  of  Browning's — ■ 
Grow  old  along  with  me, 
The  best  is  yet  to  be, 
The  last  of  life,  for  which  the  first  was  planned.

Hollywood's  Greatest  First  Night

Jt  was  undoubtedly  Hollywood's  greatest  first  night  and 
'our  indefatigable  photographer,  Stagg,  caught  the  real

Connie  Bennett  in  the  foreground  talking  with  George  Fitz-

between  Paul  Bern,  her  new  hubby  (left),  and  Harry  Cohn 
whom  she  also  embraces.  Directly  behind  this  group  you  see 
Mary  Pickford,  but  the  chap  reading  the  paper  seems  to  be

ILLUSTRATED    BY 
VAN   ARSDALE 


PARIS  has  always  been  called  "a  woman's  town."  New 
York  has  sometimes  been  thus  described.  And  now  one 
begins  to  hear  mutters  from  local  males — rather  bitter 
mutters,  they  are,  too — that  Hollywood  is  rapidly  turning 
into  the  same  sort  of  place. 

A  woman's  town,  I  take  it,  is  a  city  in  which  women  decide 
how  men  shall  spend  their  money  and  their  leisure  hours.  A 
place  where  women  are  pampered  and  their  whims  are  laws  and 
men  must  struggle  for  their  favor;  where  women  rule,  as  it  were, 
the  collective  roost.  Where  life  is  formal  and  elaborate  and 
bc-ruflled.  Where  sellers  of  emeralds  and  dealers  in  orchids  wax 
fat  and  rosy.  Where,  as  one  wag  put  it,  even  the  garbage  smells 
faintly  of  subtle  feminine  perfumes. 

Do  you  suppose  that  any  man,  left  to  his  own  choice,  would

milling  throngs  of  onlookers,  face  spotlights,  cameras  and  micro- 
phones— to  go  to  look  at  a  motion  picture? 

If  it  weren't  for  women,  would  we  have  premieres? 

I  observe  that  unattached  gentlemen,  like  Ronald  Colman 
and  Gary  Cooper,  frequently  see  a  new  picture  on  the  second 
night  of  its  run,  wearing  comfortable  business  suits  or  even 
sweaters,  without  benefit  of  press-agents  or  autograph  hunters. 
Bill  Powell  used  to  do  that,  too,  before  he  and  Carole  Lombard 
were  married. 

Do  you  suppose  that  any  man  would  choose  to  have  the  living 
room  of  his  house  done  in  white,  with  just  a  touch  of  ashes  of 
roses?  Well,  three-fourths  of  the  living  rooms  in  Beverly  Hills 
these  days  look  as  if  there  had  just  been  a  heavy  frost.    The 


Did  you  think  any 
man  would  deliber- 
ately choose  to  sit 
around  for  a  whole 
evening  in  a  formal 
evening  coat  and  a 
white  tie,  working  a 
jig-saw  puzzle? 
Yet,  that's  what 
they  do — and  like  it 
— at  Connie  Ben- 
nett's  parties 


rage  for  white  has  even  invaded  the 
beach  houses  where  it  is,  to  say  the 
least,  impractical.  Men,  as  a  rule, 
prefer  splashing,  definite  colors — red 
and  green  and  orange — and  unspot- 
table  leather  and  monk's  cloth  for 
upholstery  and  drapes.  Imagine 
what  happens  if  you  sit  down  just 
once,  in  a  wet  bathing  suit,  upon  a 
chair  cushioned  in  white  and  pastel 
chintz! 

Doug  Fairbanks  took  a  friend  to 
the  attic  at  Pickfair  the  other  night  to  show  him  some  etchings 
and  prints  of  cowboys  and  bucking  horses. 

"Why,  Doug,  these  are  swell  things!  They  are  rare  and 
valuable — why  in  the  world  do  you  keep  them  up  here  where 
you  can't  see  them?" 

Doug  smiled.  "  I  had  them  on  the  wall  in  my  room,"  he  said, 
and  changed  the  subject. 

When  Ronald  Colman  first  took  a  house  at  Malibu,  he  was 
attracted  to  it  because  it  was  remote  and  almost  primitive.  No 
electric  lights  or  gas.  All  supplies,  including  ice,  milk  and  oil 
for  fuel,  had  to  be  brought  from  the  city  by  the  householders. 
The  only  convenience  available  was  running  water.  The  three 
or  four  houses  there  were  real  beach  shacks.  Simple,  easy  to 
care  for,  furnished  for  rather  stark  comfort.  A  place  where  a 
man  could  lounge  all  day  in  a  bathing  suit  or  a  sweater  and  duck 


Once  in  a  cobalt  moon,  a  woman-bossed  male  will  break 
away  for  a  good  camping  out  and  no  dressing  for  dinner 


pants.  Where  he  would  not  be  troubled  by  callers  at  the  cock- 
tail hours.  Where  the  telephone  could  not  ring  and  where, 
certainly,  no  one  dressed  for  dinner! 

There  were  no  built-in  bars  in  those  first  houses,  no  glass- 
enclosed  terraces  where  ladies  in  smart  beach  togs  could  play 
bridge.  No  white  coated  butlers.  No  one  ever  went  swimming 
in  those  days  in  an  ermine  coat,  as  did  one  actress  in  a  prankish 
mood  last  summer! 

A  MAN'S  resort,  it  was.  A  refuge  from  parties  and  formality 
and  evening  clothes.  Do  you  suppose  that  any  regular 
man's  man  would  choose  to  spend  his  leisure  summer  hours  in 
Malibu  now — unless  some  woman  urged,  "Everyone  goes  there"? 

Ronnie  says  that  Hollywood  is  becoming  more  and  more  a 
woman's  town — for  a  rather  special  type  of  woman. 

"  Most  of  the  women  here  make  just  as  much  money  as  the 
men,"  he  told  me.  "They  don't  have  to  try  to  get  along  with 
men  because  they  are  not  dependent  upon  them.  They  can 
afford  to  be  arbitrary! 

"It  is  always  a  woman  who  plans  a  big  party — a  really 
formal,  smart  affair,  I  mean.  Men  usually  dread  those  func- 
tions. But  after  we  get  there,  urged  or  coaxed  or  dragged  by 
some  woman — we  have  a  grand  time!  I  know  I  do.  Yet  I 
should  never  think  of  giving  a  party  like  that  and  I  never  con- 
sent to  go  to  one  if  I  can  avoid  it.    It's  the  way  men  are! 

"The  woman  who  has  a  job  and  who  likes  out-of-door  things 
—  tennis,  swimming,  riding,  golf,  has  things  all  her  own  way 
here.  She  receives  more  attention  than  she  can  use.  It's  no

The 

Garbo 
Jinx 

On  Her 
Leading 

Men 


Charles  Bickf ord  stands  alone !  He  was  the  only  chap  able  to  remain 
strong,  dominant  and  natural  as  Garbo's  leading  man.  In  "Anna 
Christie"  his  performance  equalled  hers.  Charlie  thought  Greta  a 
fine  workman,  but  he  was  not  swept  off  his  feet  by  the  Garbo  mania

Ruth    Bi  e  ry 


GARBO,  the  greatest  actress  of  them  all,  is  a  deadly 
menace  to  her  leading  men. 
While  other  splendid  actresses,  like  Norma  Shearer, 
Joan  Crawford  and  Marlene  Dietrich  develop  those 
who  play  opposite  them,  Garbo  overshadows  them. 

Garbo  has  proved  to  be  an  absolute  jinx  to  eleven  of  the 
twelve  men  who  have  been  her  screen  lovers  in  the  sixteen 
single  starring  pictures  she  has  made  since  she  came  to  this 
country. 

Look  down  the  list  of  Garbo's  leading  men.  Recall  what  has 
happened! 

Ricardo  Cortez  in  "  The  Torrent."  It  took  Riccy  six  years  to 
come  back  after  those  fatal  days  spent  emoting  opposite  Garbo 
in  her  first  American  production. 

Antonio  Moreno  is  still  fighting  for  his  return — now,  via 
Mexican  pictures. 

John  Gilbert!  He  was  the  greatest  star  when  the  Swedish 
newcomer  became  his  leading  lady.  Today,  she  holds  that 
position.    He  has  never  stood  alone  in  vivid,  individual  splendor 


since  the  completion  of  the  three  pictures  they  made  together. 

Lars  Hanson  returned  to  Sweden. 

Conrad  Nagel  was  a  capable,  popular  leading  man  in  the 
days-before-Garbo.  But  since  he  completed  his  second  film 
with  her,  he  has  not  had  a  real  chance. 

Nils  Asther,  at  first  a  sensation,  left  the  screen.  He  is  just 
now  fighting  for  a  come-back. 

Gavin  Gordon  had  a  good  record  on  Broadway.  He  came  to 
Hollywood  with  one  definite  hope — to  play  in  a  picture  with 
the  woman  who  had  appealed  to  his  imagination  as  no  woman 
had  before,  on  or  off  screen.  Garbo!  He  realized  his  ambition 
in  "Romance."    He  has  done  nothing  of  importance  since. 

Robert  Montgomery!  The  colorful,  light-hearted  Mont- 
gomery of  Norma's  and  Joan's  pictures  became  a  colorless 
shadow  of  his  former  self  in  "Inspiration."  Thousands  of 
Montgomery  fans  wrote  letters  demanding  that  he  never  again 
be  subjected  to  the  Garbo-jinx. 

And  Clark  Gable.  You  saw  him  at  his  worst  in  "Susan 
Lenox."    Only  his  splendid  work  in  "A  Free  Soul"  with  Norma

Shearer,  and  "Possessed"  with  Joan  Crawford,  saved  him  from 
in  ignominious  retreat  from  the  screen  after  his  single  experi- 
■nce  with  Garbo. 

Ramon  Novarro.  If  Bob  Montgomery  was  a  shadow  of  his 
ormer  self  in  "Inspiration,"  Ramon  was  merely  a  ghost  in 
'Mata  Hari."  Only  eleven  years  of  stardom  and  memories  of 
'Ben  Hur,"  "Scaramouche"  and  "The  Pagan"  saved  him. 

Did  you  see  Melvyn  Douglas,  a  Broadway  newcomer,  with 
Gloria  Swanson  in  "Tonight  or  Never"?  He  was  alert,  lively 
ind  emotional.  Compare  him  with  the  stiff,  awkward,  lethargic 
ictor  opposite  Garbo  in  "As  You  Desire  Me."  Melvyn 
mastered  Gloria.    Greta  mastered  him. 

YOU  notice  that  we  skipped  Charles  Bickford.  He  is  the 
exception  that  proves  the  rule.  In  "Anna  Christie,"  he  was 
brilliant  arid  dominant.  Charles  Bickford  kept  his  personality. 
But  even  Charlie  has  not  had  a  really  big  screen  opportunity 
since!  Of  all  the  curious  phenomena  surrounding  this  curious 
woman,  this  is  the  most  singular. 

It  is  the  most  amazing  angle  of  her  unparalleled  career. 

Nothing  about  Garbo  is  com- 
parable to  the  histories  of  other 
internationally  famous  women. 
She,  indeed,  stands  alone.  An 
anomaly;  a  phantom  woman, 
who  defies  description. 

But  the  fact  remains  that  over 
a  period  of  seven  years,  through 
seventeen  pictures,  she  has  been 
consistently  the  greatest  money- 
maker of  the  Hollywood  stars. 
There  is  nothing  weird,  phantom 
or  unexplainable  about  those 
cold,  metallic,  box-office  figures! 

She  snatched  glory;  she  has 
held  onto  it.  But  as  she  held  it 
with  a  grasp  which  grew  stronger 
and  stronger,  she  weakened  the 
hold  which  others  already  had 
upon  it. 

Even  Lionel  Barrymore  gave 
the  weakest  performance  of  his 
illustrious  career  in  "Mata  Hari." 
It  is  one  role  which  both  Lionel 
and  his  admirers  wish  to  forget! 

Is  Garbo  to  blame  for  this  jinx 
which  she  has  brought  to  the 
men  who  have  played  with  her? 

I  think  not.  No  single  brain 
could  have  created,  either  de- 
liberately or  intuitively,  the  per-

sonality  or  career  of  Garbo.    She  was  born  an  unusual  woman; 
fate  has  developed  her  exceptional  qualities. 

Garbo  could  not  have  designed  her  life  as  an  architect  does  a 
building.  She  could  not  foretell  that,  as  she  was  to  add  to  her 
glory,  she  would  detract  from  the  glory  of  others.  If  she  could 
have  foreseen — she  would  have  plotted  differently.  She  is, 
by  nature,  the  kindliest  of  women.  The  mechanics,  elec- 
tricians, cameramen  and  prop  boys  will  furnish  you  with  proof 
of  this. 

There  was  the  day  when  fifteen  additional  minutes  of  work 
would  have  completed  her  picture.  That  meant  she  could 
remain  at  home  the  next  day.  She  needed  rest.  But  if  she  left 
at  five  sharp,  as  is  her  invariable  habit  and  her  contract  right, 
it  would  mean  another  day  of  much  needed  work  for  the 
laborers.  She  knew  that  they  depended  upon  her  to  close  shop 
at  five;  that  they  felt  safe  in  making  definite  engagements  while 
employed  on  a  Garbo  picture.  She  did  not  hesitate  but  smiled 
that  slow,  wistful,  slightly  amused  smile  which  is  so  typical  of 
her.     "  I  tank  I  go  home.     We  will  finish  tomorrow." 

When  she  completed  her  latest  picture  at  M-G-M,  "As  You 

Desire  Me,"  there  was  a  diamond 
watch  for  one  of  them;  a  gor- 
geous traveling  case  for  another. 
No  member  of  that  crew  of 
thirty  was  forgotten.  She  had 
chosen  each  gift  herself. 

No,  the  Garbo  jinx  is  not  in- 
tentional. It  is,  like  the  rest  of 
her,  something  that  she,  herself, 
cannot  interpret  or  control. 

There  are  two  classes  of  men 
who  have  played  opposite  her:

THERE  was  a  real  heartbreak  in  Gloria 
Swanson's  recent  sale  of  her  favorite 
screen  story,  "Rockabye."  For  that  yarn 
was  the  apple  of  Gloria's  eye  and  the  joy  of 
her  heart! 

Little  did  she  know,  when  the  dicker  was 
made,  that  the  great  role  would  be  played  by 
Constance  Bennett — her  matrimonial,  pro- 
fessional and  social  rival! 

Old  Cal's  tears  spoiled  his  morning  coffee 
when  he  first  heard  the  tale.  For  I  know  how 
near  and  dear  to  the  heart  of  the  star  was  this 
same  "Rockabye."  She  ached  to  play  it.  she 
toiled  over  the  script — she  had  consummate 
faith  in  the  story  as  a  means  to  a  magnificent 
comeback  to  her  heights  as  an  emotional  star. 
Hut  she  couldn't  make  Samuel  Goldwyn  see  it 
her  way,  and  the  story  was  shelved  to  make 
way  for  another. 

Then  Michael  Farmer  came  along.  Marriage 
and  motherhood  interrupted  the  Swanson 
career.  Soon,  from  London,  will  come  an 
English-made  picture  as  her  screen  return. 

Perhaps  finances  forced  her  to  peddle  her 
beloved  "•Rockabye."  Something  else  may 
have  caused  the  loss.  At  any  rate,  what 
tragic  irony!  To  have  her  favorite  tale  in  the 
hands  of  Connie,  who  married  her  Marquis 
and  took  her  vacant  place  on  the  screen — 
what  a  bitter  pill  for  Gloria  to  swallow!

LIKE  most  brides,  Jean  Harlow 
needed  a  dress  to  be  married  in. 
So  the  day  before  the  ceremony  she 
rushed  into  a  smart  shop,  tried  on  a 
white  beauty  just  in  from  Paris,  said 
"I'll  take  it"  without  looking  further.

gifts.  Over  a  hundred  dozen  glasses  alone — 
cocktail,  water  and  wine.  Mostly  solid  rock

The  gift  that  touched  Jean  most  was  a  set 
of  sterling  spoons  that  had  been  in  her 
secretary's  family  for  generations.  This  sec- 
retary, Nancy  Barbara  Brown,  was  a  chum  of 
Jean's  in  finishing  school.  She  wanted  to  be

men a  wild-goose  chase.  Finally  cornered,  she 
did  say  a  few  words,  but  revealed  little. 

A  few  days  later  she  quietly  boarded  a  ship 
and  lit  out  for  her  holiday. 

"DEFORE  Greta  sailed  away,  these  were  the

That  her  vacation  would  last  three  months. 

That  she  will  re-sign  with  M-G-M  for  three 
years,  her  pay-check  to  begin  at  $12, 500a  week. 

That  her  health,  at  present,  is  not  too  good. 

These,  as  I  say,  are  rumors.  But  don't  sue. 
Who  can  collect  these  days?

■*-*  Garbo  had  been  especially  nice  to  the 
crew  during  the  shooting  of  her  last  picture, 
and  the  boys  decided  to  return  the  kindness. 
They  had  a  swell  scroll  made  up,  and  all  signed 
it  and,  one  was  deputized  to  deliver  the  dingus 
to  the  star.  All  shined  up,  the  lad  went  to 
Garbo's  home  and  found  the  gate  locked. 
Nothing  daunted,  he  climbed  over  the  wall  into 
the  grounds — and  was  chased  right  back  over 
the  fence  by  Greta's  man-eating  hound!  All 
the  poor  fellow  could  do  was  toss  the  fancy 
scroll  over  the  fence  into  the  yard  and  trust 
to  luck  that  the  star  got  it!

Buster  took  their  two  sons  and  lit  out  for  Mex-

from  Xatalie.    And  there  were  other  times.

Wesley  ("Cimarron")  Ruggles,  the  prospective 
papa,  looks  excited  and  happy. 

It's  a  girl  at  the  Spencer  Tracy's,  and

for  the  two-year-old  girl  of  the  family. 

T3UT  Hollywood  is  furthest  agog  about 
■"■^Connie  Bennett! 

Is  she  going  to  be  one  of  the  next  Hollywood 
mamas  of  the  royal  line?  That's  the  red-hot 
rumor  of  the  moment. 


For  the  Hollywood  Parade 


Irving  Lippman 

Although  they  say  it  isn't  a  ro- 
mance anymore,  when  Mary  Brian 
was  in  New  York  in  vaudeville 
she  spent  a  lot  of  time  at  the  Penn- 
sylvania Roof  Garden  where 
Buddy  Rogers  is  orchestra-leading 


Irving  Lippman 

Three  famous  Hollywood  grins,  but  alas — this  picture  was  snapped  just  before 
Ann  Dvorak  (left)  ran  away  to  Europe  because  she  wasn't  making  as  much  money 
as  a  baby  that  played  in  one  of  her  pictures;  Joan  Blondell  went  for  a  yachting 
trip  with  her  mother  and  her  best  beau  "somewhere  in  the  Pacific,"  and  Bette 
Davis  set  out  for  an  Eastern  vaudeville  tour.  Ah,  Hollywood — here  today  and 
gone    tomorrow.      We    are    wondering    when    will    these    three    meet    again? 


Connie  is  to  sail  for  the  south  of  France  in 
September.  If  the  little  stranger  (if  there  is  to 
be  one)  is  born  over  there,  a  nice  international 
problem  is  posed.  A  French  father,  and  born 
on  French  soil.  Probably  a  little  French 
Bennett,  is  the  answer. 

T  HATE  a  fellow  who  says  "I  told  you  so" 
but  it  was  no  surprise  when  Ruth  Chatter- 
ton  and  Ralph  Forbes  came  to  a  parting  of  the 
ways.  Ralph  is  now  in  Reno  seeing  about  the 
little  thing  one  goes  to  Reno  to  see  about. 

Ruth  and  Ralph  have  continued  to  go  places 
together  and  while  they  have  remained 
friends,  the  old  spark  was  undoubtedly  gone. 
Theirs  is  as  friendly  a  divorce  as  the  one  Ann 
Harding  and  Harry  Bannister  enjoyed,  but 
without  any  apparent  heartaches  on  either 
side.  George  Brent  is  quoted  assaying  that  Ruth 
and  he  will  be  married  upon  her  return  from 
Europe.  They  have  seen  a  good  deal  of  each 
other  since  he  was  her  leading  man  in  "The 
Rich  Are  Always  With  Us."  And,  of  course, 
there  has  been  gossip — the  nicer  sort  of  gossip, 
for  they  are  three  nice  people. 

TLTOLLYWOOD'S     myriad     tongues    have 

been  on  the  wag  concerning  the  Countess 

Dentice  di  Frasso  and  Gary  Cooper.    It's  an 


old  Hollywood — nay,  world-wide — custom. 
She's  a  house-guest  of  Mary  and  Doug,  by 
the  by. 

But  an  angle  to  the  Frasso-Cooper  friend- 
ship that  the  town  doesn't  know  is  that  the 
tall  boy  is  paying  back,  in  a  friendly  way,  the 
many  kindnesses  the  lady  and  her  husband 
showed  Cooper  during  his  stay  in  Rome. 

Gary  was  very  ill  with  jaundice  in  the 
Eternal  City,  and  the  Count  and  Countess 
brought  him  the  best  medical  attention 
available.  Then  they  went  to  Africa  with 
him  on  his  hunting  trip.  The  titled  lady  says 
Gary  is  a  crack  shot — he  always  gets  his  lion. 
And  in  return  for  the  Frassos'  kindness,  Cooper 
has  been  doing  the  gentlemanly  act  during 
the  Countess'  Hollywood  sojourn. 

"pvIRECTOR  Josef  Von  Sternberg, 
■'-^discoverer  of  Marlene  Dietrich, 
is  putting  on  a  better  act  than  ever, 
these  days,  reporters  say.  "Psycho- 
analytically  speaking,"  is  his  pet 
phrase.  Joe's  big  moment  comes 
when  he  is  sitting  in  his  modernistic 
office,  pointing  to  the  modern  art  on 
the  walls  and  saying,  "Pictures  are 
only  a  secondary  interest  to  me !  My 
real  passions  are  art  and  music!" 


T\  THAT  will  Chevalier  do  now,  romantically 
^^  speaking? 

That's  the  question  that  overshadows  war 
debts  in  the  public  mind  today! 

"I  have  no  other  love,"  says  Maurice,  in- 
dignantly casting  aside  all  references  to  himself 
and  Marlene  Dietrich. 

"We  are  divorcing  to  keep  our  friendship," 
was  the  word  from  Yvonne  Vallee,  Maurice's 
charming  little  French  spouse  to  whom  he  has 
been  wed  since  1927. 

"Incompatibility"  was  a  reason  both  agreed 
on. 

A/[RS.  CHEVALIER  spent  considerable  time 
in  this  country  since  Maurice  clicked  in 
American  pictures.  Some  talk  was  caused  when 
she  suddenly  left  Hollywood  and  trekked  back 
to  France  not  long  ago.  Chevalier's  surprise 
action  followed  as  soon  as  he  reached  his  home- 
land. The  tongues  of  gossip  are  already  awag. 
New  York  newspapers  casually  mentioned  that 
Genevieve  Tobin  sailed  on  the  same  ship  as 
Maurice.  They  appeared  together,  you  remem- 
ber, in  "One  Hour  With  You." 

In  the  meantime,  a  few  million  American 
girls  are  going  to  be  wondering  in  which  direc- 
tion maddening  Maurice's  heart  will  veer!

the 

Script  and 

"Stole"  the 
Picture 


SIX  weeks  before  the  assembled  mo- 
tion   picture    critics   of   Hollywood 
proclaimed  her  one  of  the  real  dis- 
coveries of  the  year  at  a  studio  pre- 
view of  "The  Age  of  Consent,"  Dorothy 
Wilson  was  contentedly  copying  the  script 
of  that  very  picture  in  the  stenographic 
department  of  the  Radio  Pictures  studios. 
No   great   beauty   in   real   life,   she   is 
utterly  lovely  on  the  screen.     But  most 
remarkable  of  all  is  her  amazing  talent. 
'"She  is  just  a  natural  actress,"  said 
Gregory  La  Cava,  the  director.     "It  was  hard  to  believe  that 
she  had  never  faced  the  camera  before.     I  told  her  what  I 
wanted  and  she  gave  it  to  me.     That  girl  is  going  to  be  one  of 
the  great  emotional  actresses  of  the  screen  and  it  won't  be 
long,  either." 

A  few  weeks  before  she  was  selected  for  the  part,  the  ex- 
ecutives had  given  screen  tests  to  several  stenographers, 
hoping  to  find  new  personalities,  and  Gregory  La  Cava  saw 
something  in  Dorothy  Wilson's  test  that  made  him  know  she 
was  the  girl  he  wanted. 

Four  years  ago  she  was  a  Minneapolis  high  school  girl.  She 
took  a  six  months'  course  in  stenography,  worked  three  years

Richard  Cromwell  has  been  con- 
sidered one  of  Hollywood's  best 
juveniles  ever  since  he  played  the 
title  role  in  "Tol'able  David"  about 
two  years  ago.  Capable  and  at- 
tractive young  actor  that  he  is, 
Dorothy  Wilson,  who  moved  from 
the  stenographic  department  of 
the  studio  to  leading  lady  in 
"The  Age  of  Consent,"  stole  the 
honors  right  from  under  his  eyes 


in  Minneapolis  and  then  she  came  to 
Hollywood.  Dorothy  had  no  high-flown 
ambition;  she  wanted  and  got  a  steno- 
graphic job  at  the  studio.  That  was  a 
year  ago. 

And  while  Dorothy  bent  over  her  type- 
writer, the  dramatic  coach  from  the 
studio  was  searching  through  the  colleges 
of  the  country  for  new  screen  bets.  It's 
very  doubtful  that  in  this  nation-wide 
search  he  will  find  a  girl  who  can  act  as 
Dorothy  Wilson  can. 
Yet.  there  she  was  right  on  the  home  lot!  One  of  those 
strange  set-ups  only  to  be  found  in  Hollywood. 

HERE'S  another  amusing  sidelight  on  this  Cinderella  story. 
When  they  engaged  her  for  the  picture,  they  told  her  that 
the  day  she  finished  the  film  she  was  to  go  back  to  her  typewriter 
until  they  had  discovered  whether  the  public  liked  her  or  not. 
But  Dorothy  wasn't  kept  on  the  anxious  seat  very  long. 
There  came  another  fast  break  for  her. 

They  didn't  have  to  wait  for  the  public.  The  reviewers 
settled  the  matter  right  then  and  there  in  that  projection 
room. 


Gaston  Longet 


HERE'S  the  most  annoying  picture  of  the  month.  Look  at  these 
three  Radio  Pictures  mermaids — and  who  wouldn't? — playing 
around  in  a  Hollywood  pool  while  the  rest  of  us  slave.  Phyllis  Fraser, 
wearing  one  of  the  new  bathing  caps  that  look  like  hair,  Rochelle 
Hudson  and  Mary  Mason  show  how  difficult  it  is  to  be  a  film  actress

THEY  were  talking  about  this  Robert  Young  the  other  day  in  Holly 
wood.  "That  boy  has  everything — pep,  poise  and  real  screen 
warmth,"  was  the  consensus  of  opinion.  And  lots  of  movie-goers  wrote 
to  Photoplay  protesting  because  his  name  wasn't  in  electric  lights  over 
"The  Wet  Parade."     It'll  be  there  soon  or  we  don't  know  star  stuff! 


THEY'VE  taken  Joel  McCrea  out  of  the  drawing-room  and  given 
him  a  couple  of  desert  islands  to  roam  around  in  a  la  Tarzan.  In 
both  "Bird  of  Paradise"  and  "The  Most  Dangerous  Game,"  he  gives 
Johnny  Weissmuller  competition.  But  this  cinematic  change  hasn't 
affected  Joel's  private  life.  He  is  still  Hollywood's  favorite  Beau  Brummel 


Cecil  Beaton 


IT'S  funny  about  Evelyn  Brent — Betty  to  her  pals.  Directors  say 
that  she's  an  A-numberone  actress,  yet  months  go  by  and  Betty's 
lovely,  brooding  face  is  not  before  the  cameras.  So  clap  hands  while  you 
have  the  chance.  She  now  has  a  role  with  Marlene  Dietrich  in  "The 
Blonde  Venus."    (Aside  to  Marlene :  You're  up  against  competition,  girl) 


Harold    Offers  $1000™  To 

\     Photoplay  Readers  for  Gags 


These  stills  from  Harold  Lloyd's  new  comedy,  "Movie  Crazy,"  illustrate  what  Harold  considers  a 
perfect  gag.  In  fact,  it  is  one  of  a  series  of  gags,  or,  as  is  known  in  picture  parlance,  a  "running  gag." 
When  you  see  "Movie  Crazy"  you'll  find  out  how  the  gag  ends.  We  can't  spoil  your  fun  by  explaining 
it  here.  But  we  can  give  you  these  tips.  The  gag  is  simple.  It  involves  the  crushing  of  a  straw  hat. 
Just  to  break  a  straw  hat  comes  under  the  heading  of  slapstick.  But  here,  because  of  the  situation 
that  has  been  worked  out,  it  is  elevated  to  high  comedy.     Now  read  about  Harold's  Gag  Contest 


HOW  many  times  have  you  thought  of  some  hilarious 
joke,  stunt  or  situation  which,  if  enacted  upon  the 
screen,  would  send  movie  audiences  into  convulsions 
of  laughter? 

Probably  every  time  you  see  a  motion  picture  comedy  you 
say,  "  I  know  one  as  funny  as  that.  " 

Well,  here  is  your  chance  to  write  one  as  funny  as  that — and 
cash  in  on  it! 

What  everybody  needs  and  wants  right  now  is  a  great  big 
laugh — and  the  more  the  merrier. 

Harold  Lloyd  has  done  his  share  to  make  the  world  laugh  by 
producing  and  acting  in  "Movie  Crazy,"  and  dozens  of  other 
comedies.  Now  he  is  going  to  give  every  reader  of  Photoplay 
an  opportunity  to  demonstrate  his  or  her  wit  and,  at  the  same 
time,  make  money  out  of  it.  He  is  offering,  through  Photo- 
play Magazine,  SI, 000  in  cash  prizes  for  the  best  107  jokes, 
stunts  or  situations  selected  by  a  judging  committee  composed 
of  Harold  Lloyd,  James  R.  Quirk  and  selected  members  of 
Photoplay's  editorial  staff. 

All  you  have  to  do  is  think  up  a  "gag."  In  Hollywood  the 
lads  who  get  weekly  salaries  for  doing  this  call  themselves  by 
the  high-fallutin'  name  of  "comedy  constructionists."  But 
around  the  studios  they  are  known  as  "gag  men." 

A  gag  is  simply  a  funny  situation — the  sort  you  see  on  the 
street  or  in  your  homes  every  day.  It  may  involve  one  person 
or  a  group  of  people.    The  main  point  is  that  it  must  be  funny. 

Perhaps  you  may  remember  a  gag  that  you  have  seen  or 
experienced  in  real  life.  Maybe  it  will  be  just  a  bit  of  fanciful 
fun  that  seems  to  you  to  have  photographic  possibilities.  If 
you  think  it  is  funny,  put  it  on  paper.    You  can  use  up  to  500 


words,  but  if  you  can  say  it  in  less,  so  much  the  better.  Send 
your  gag  or  gags  to  the  Movie  Crazy  Contest  Editor,  Photo- 
play Magazine,  221  West  57th  Street,  New  York  City.  Your 
situation,  joke  or  gag  may  win  one  of  the  prizes. 

The  prize  money  will  be  divided  as  follows:  First  prize, 
$250;  second  prize,  $100;  third  prize,  $50;  four  prizes  of  $25 
each;  one  hundred  prizes  of  $5  each,  making  a  total  of  107 
prizes. 

There  is  nothing  complicated  about  entering  this  contest. 
All  you  have  to  do  is  to  describe  the  joke,  stunt,  scene,  situa- 
tion— in  other  words,  the  gag — in  simple,  everyday  words  and 
send  it  in. 

BUT  before  you  do  this,  be  sure  to  turn  to  page  125  of  this 
magazine  and  read  the  rules  of  the  contest  very  carefully. 
Don't  fail  to  do  this,  for  by  neglecting  to  follow  the  rules,  a 
very  fine  gag  of  yours  might  be  disqualified. 

A  later  issue  of  Photoplay  Magazine  will  tell  you  when  the 
winners  will  be  announced.  The  judges  assure  you  that  it  will 
be  as  early  as  possible. 

Remember  that  this  doesn't  take  any  literary  genius.  Just 
sit  down  and  write  the  gag  as  you  would  tell  it  to  a  friend. 
Think  back  and  remember  all  those  situations  that  have  caused 
you  to  say,  "Why,  that  ought  to  be  in  a  movie — it  would  be 
a  scream." 

You  can  send  in  as  many  gags  as  you  like,  but  keep  them 
short,  snappy  and  to  the  point!  It's  easy  and  will  give  you  a 
laugh  while  you're  thinking  them  up.  This  is  Harold  Lloyd's 
and  Photoplay  Magazine's  invitation  to  you  to  join  the  con- 
test and  have  some  fun.

A  row  of  houses  on  a  sandy  shore.    Bound  by  Con-

Hi  there,  Malibu. 

A  half  mile  stretch  of  delirium  tremens  architecture  along  an 
astounded  Pacific  Ocean. 

Even  the  fish  can't  get  over  it.  And  the  sea-gulls  fly  dizzily 
around.  Squawking  for  help  and  a  bit  more  imported 
caviar. 

Where  people  build  seventy-five  thousand  dollar  houses  on  a 
thirty  foot  lot  they  can  never  own.  And  pay  a  dollar  a  day  for 
the  privilege. 

The  freak  property  of  the  world. 

"What,  sell  my  land,"  cries  the  owner,  "when  people, 
hundreds  of  people,  pay  me  one  dollar  every  day  just  for  the 
privilegeoflivingonit?  For  just  ten  years?  Beyourladylikeself." 

Malibu.    Where  everything  is  dated  from  the  fires.

Where  the  white  stone  mansion  of  Miss  Ringe,  the  owner  of 
Malibu's  golden  sand,  sets  high  above  the  movie  colony  on  a 
nearby  hill  and  looks  down.  Wondering,  wondering,  won- 
dering. 

A  good  half  mile  strip  of  houses.  With  a  tiny  three  feet  be- 
tween. A  Swiss  chalet  next  to  a  Southern  manse.  With  bell 
ringers  and  yodeling  in  one  house  and  banjo  strumming  in  the 

i  other. 

A  Spanish  fandango  with  a  tamale  front  next  door  to  an  up

The  red  and  white  mansion  of  Lil  Tashman.    And  a  Mexican

By  Sara   Hamilton 


A  suburban  type  home  with  green 
grass  in  Ike  front  yard,  geraniums,  palm 
trees  and  shrubs.  On  a  sandy  shore.  I 
ask  you,  ladies  and  gentlemen  of  the  jury,  I  ask  you. 

And  all  this  next  door  to  a  sand-drifted  front  yard,  with  the 
sand  sweeping  across  a  completely  hidden  fence  into  the  jellied 
consomme. 

Chiffon  curtains  to  an  ocean-sprayed  window.  Cretonne, 
next  door.    Oriental  rugs.     With  grass  ones  on  the  other  side. 

Every  house  screaming  out  the  personality  of  the  owner.  A 
dead  giveaway. 

"Here  am  I.  A  Spanish  complex  with  a  slight  leaning  to 
Bank  of  Italy  architecture.    Look." 

We  look. 

But  no  matter  the  style  or  period  of  any  house  they  all  have 
that  triangular  glass  windbreaker  on  the  northwest  corner  of 
the  fence.    There  is  such  a  thing  as  an  ocean  breeze  overdoing  it. 

It  began,  this  Malibu,  with  Anna  Q.  Nilsson,  a  desire  to  rest, 
and  a  tiny  board  hut.  And,  year  by  year,  it  has  grown  bigger 
and  bigger,  and  madder  and  madder,  and  gayer  and  gayer. 

hi 


In  this  little  red  and  white  nest,  buffet  supper  may  start  at 
7  P.  M.  Friday  and  finish  around  10  Tuesday  morning.  It 
belongs  to  Eddie  Lowe  and  Lil  Tashman.  And  there  are 
mine  host  and  mine  hostess,  themselves,  snatching  a  short, 
quiet  sun  bath.  Lil's  bathing  suit  and  Eddie's  robe  are  red 
and  white  to  match  the  house.  And,  you  ask,  who  are 
those  folks  at  the  back  door?     Oh,  just  a  few  droppers-in 


People  once  paraded  in  old  sweaters  and  corduroy.  And  now 
look.    If  you  have  a  strong  constitution,  that  is. 

A  3  by  6,  red  and  white  awning  on  a  front  porch  on  Monday, 
means  three  new  red,  white  and  blue  6  by  9  awnings  on  Tuesday, 
four  red,  white,  blue  and  orange  9  by  12  awnings  by  Wednesday 
and  on  and.  on,  until  the  next  Monday  the  original  awning- 
putter-out  thinks  up  another  one  to  slap  the  neighbors  silly. 
It's  grand. 

And  styles.  At  the  beginning  of  each  season  all  the  Malibu- 
ites  gather  up  last  season's  clothes  and  swear  this  year  they'll 
wear  out  their  old  things  at  the  beach.  What's  a  beach  for  but 
to  wear  out  old  clothes,  they  demand? 

Then,  the  first  warm  Sunday,  Lil  Tashman  or  Connie  Bennett 
strolls,  oh  so  nonchalantly,  up  the  beach,  and  the  riot  is  on.  A 
bright  green  bathing  suit,  backless  on  Monday,  means  four 
brighter  green  backless  suits  on  Tuesday.  On  Wednesday, 
there  are  seventeen  of  the  brightest  green  suits  full  of  wide  open 
spaces  ever  viewed  by  mankind.  And  are  they  viewed?  Until 
the  next  Sunday  someone  thinks  up  something  else. 

GOOD  old  Malibu.  Where  everything  is  different  from  an 
everyday  world.  Elsewhere  rents  go  down.  In  Malibu, 
they  go  up.    Like  a  fevered  temperature. 

Seven  hundred  and  fifty  dollars  a  month  for  a  yellow  frame 
cottage.  Including  dog  kennels,  of  course.  Seventeen  hundred

Here's  the  lad  who 
stands  guard  over 
Malibu,  at  the  main 
road.  A  kidnapper  or 
a  casual  whoopee- 
maker  with  seven  or 
eight  too  many  under 
his  belt  wouldn't  have 
a  chance  against  hard- 
boiled  Bill  Barber,  who 
shoots  a  mean  forty- 
five,  if  the  occasion 
rises.  Bill  knows 
who  has  and  who 
hasn't  the  right  to  ca- 
vort on  Malibu  sands 


Welcome — if  you're 
invited — to  the 
brand  new  home  of 
Marie  Prevost. 
Right  on  the  sandy 
front  yard  there's  a 
small  strip  of  gar- 
den. And  what  a 
grand  sun  porch  for 
bridge  playing.  But 
does  Marie  have 
any  privacy?  Just 
see  how  close  her 
next-door  neigh- 
bor's house  is. 
That's   Malibu! 


The  general  store  at  Malibu  looks  just  like  the  one  at 
Hicktown,  except  that  R.  L.  Bills,  the  proprietor,  sells 
more  caviar  and  pare  de  fois  gras  than  pecks  of  potatoes 
and  turnips.  John  Boles,  in  typical  Malibu  costume  — 
white  cap,  white  sweater  and  open  shirt  —  does  the 
family  marketing  for  his  missus  just  like  you  and  I  do 


on  those  stepins?  Ridiculous.  Simply  ridiculous,  if  you  ask 
me." 

A  stone  wall  along  the  coast  highway  protects  Malibu  from 
the  outside  world.  At  the  gateway  stands  a  small  white  hut. 
The  post  office.  With  old-time  open  boxes  and  names  printed 
beneath.  And  what  names!  Connie  Bennett,  Chico  Marx, 
Warner  Baxter,  Estelle  Taylor,  Leila  Hyams,  George  O'Brien, 
Eddie  Lowe,  Louise  Fazenda  and  dozens  of  others  as  famous. 

"My  dear,  there's  that  same  bill  for  Susan  Bigname  again. 
See,  sticking  out  of  her  box.  Well,  the  way  some  people  don't 
pay  their  bills  has  me  under." 

Just  a  village  post  office  where  world-famous  people  gather 
every  day  for  mail  and  gossip.  Just  as  thousands  of  others  do, 
the  world  over. 


A  gateman  is  posted  here  who 
halts  every  incoming  car  of 
strangers.  "All  right,  where  are 
you  going?  You  expected?  Just 
a  minute."  As  we  now  have  tele- 
phones in  some  houses,  the  gate- 
man  phones.  "You  expecting 
visitors  from  Sedalia,  today? 
Two  women,  one  man,  four  chil- 
dren, one  with  the  whooping 
cough,  and  four  guinea  pigs?  No? 
Okay. 

"Out    please,     and    make    it 
snappy.    You're  not  expected." 
And   the  informal  visitors  are 
on  their  way.    Out. 

A  kidnapper  wouldn't  have  a  chance  to  ply  his  trade  here. 
A  straight  road  leads  down  from  the  main  highway  to  the 
settlement.  From  the  back  road  all  that  can  be  seen  is  a  row  of 
garages  and  a  low  black  fence  marked,  "Visitors  for  number 
fifty-three  park  here.  Visitors  for  sixty-eight  park  here,  etc." 
The  owners'  Chevrolets,  Rolls  Royces,  Packards,  Fords  are  all 
tucked  away  in  the  small  garages. 

Seven  patrolmen  are  on  duty  night  and  day.  Protecting  the 
homes  from  gate  crashers  that  may  have  gotten  past  the  gate- 
man,  souvenir  seekers,  over-eager  fans  and  yes,  gangsters. 
Then  too,  there's  the  ever-present  danger  of  fire. 

After  the  first  fire,  when  fourteen  houses  burned  to  the 
ground,  a  new  fire  engine  was     [  please  turn  to  page  108  ] 


HERE  he  is — idol  of  the  New  York  Stage,  now  called

Blonde  Venus. "  If  you  want  to  know  just  how  fine  mar-

Folks— that's  Romance/ 

Neither  Herbert  nor  Edna  will  allow  their 
careers  to  separate  them.  While  he  is  acting 
in  Hollywood,  she  plays  housewife  for  him 


Do  you  remember  the  tender  love  scenes  played  by  Herbert  Marshall  and 
Edna  Best  in  the  English-made  film,  "Michael  and  Mary"?  That  wasn't  act- 
ing— that  was  just  the  way  Herbert  really  feels  toward  his  wife,  and  the  way 
Edna  loves  him.     Maybe  some  Hollywood  producer  will  co-star  these  two 


T>

fHE  biggest  and  finest  true  love  story  in  Hollywood  is 
an  imported  one,  right  off  the  ship,  labeled  "Made  in 
England. " 

It's  the  story  of  Mr.  and  Mrs.  (Edna  Best)  Herbert 
Marshall. 

Playing  throughout  the  country  today  is  a  British-made  pic- 
ture. It's  as  simple  and  unpretentious  as  its  title,  "Michael 
and  Mary. "  If  you  see  it,  you  will  capture  something  of  the 
rare  sweetness  which  belongs  to  this  couple  in  real  life. 

In  a  few  weeks,  you  will  see  Marshall  in  an  American  picture 
opposite  Marlene  Dietrich.  It's  "  The  Blonde  Venus. "  Mean- 
while, Edna  is  playing  housewife  for  the  first  time  in  her  busy 
career. 

You  really  cannot  appreciate  this  couple  unless  you  see 
"Michael  and  Mary."  Although  it  is  merely  a  play,  it  will 
make  you  love  them.  This  may  seem  like  free  advertising,  but 
it's  okay  with  the  editor  because  he  raved  about  the  picture 
to  me. 

Hollywood  picture  companies  are  always  trying  to  separate 
those  love  birds.  Remember  when  Edna  came  to  Hollywood 
with  a  six-months  contract  with  M-G-M?  She  had  her  cos- 
tumes ready  and  her  tests  made  for  the  lead  with  Jack  Gilbert 
in  "The  Phantom  of  Paris."  Then  came  the  day  to  start  the 
picture.  And  with  it  arrived  a  telegram  from  Mrs.  Herbert 
Marshall  saying  she  was  on  the  train  en  route  to  New  York. 
She  could  not  stand  being  anywhere — not  even  Hollywood, 
without  her  husband! 

They  are  as  reticent  as  a  pair  of  high-bred  Persian  cats. 
They  refuse  to  talk  about  themselves.  You  can't  interview 
them. 

Marshall  won't  talk  about  his  ghastly  war  experience,  which 
left  him  with  a  bad  leg.    Look  sharply  when 
you  see  him  on  the  screen  and  you  can  de-         J>  ..      D  Jf  f 
tect  a  slight  limp,  which  only  adds  to  his       **  J      **■  u  * 


charm.  His  nice  English  face  gives  no  evidence  that  he  still 
suffers  and  that  every  once  in  a  while  another  operation  is 
necessary. 

But  if  physical  suffering  can  bring  to  a  man  the  love  and  ten- 
derness that  Edna  has  for  him,  perhaps  he  thanks  God  for  that 
shrapnel-shell. 

There  is  more  than  just  physical  beauty  in  Edna's  face.  The 
physical  perfection  is  there  but  with  it — something  beyond. 
Spiritual  loveliness  is  the  most  difficult  quality  to  describe.  It 
has  a  way  of  defying  the  adjectives  of  a  human  language,  be- 
cause it  reaches  beneath  the  everyday  understanding  of  human 
beings.  But  when  you  see  Edna  on  the  screen  you  will  catch 
something  of  that  idyllic  love  that  does  not  allow  her  to  leave 
Herbert  even  for  the  length  of  time  it  takes  to  make  a  single 
picture.  In  "Michael  and  Mary,"  her  characterization 
stretches  from  girlhood  to  middle-age.  I  really  do  not  know  in 
which  part  she  is  the  more  lovely. 

THIS  love  which  grows  so  straight  and  strong  was  not  a  mad 
first-sight  affair.    They  met  on  the  English  stage  and  played 
several  roles  together.     In  1926,  they  co-starred  in  their  first 
American  success,  Michael  Arlen's  "These  Charming  People." 
They  thought  that  they  loved  then,  but  they  waited  to  make 
certain.    Love,  to  them,  must  supersede  everything  else.    If  it 
were  a  perfect  love,  it  must  help  careers;  not  interfere.    They 
have  given  their  romance  some  pretty  severe  tests  and  it  has 
come  through  them  all  valiantly.     In  1928,  while  they  were 
playing  "The  High  Road"  in  New  York,  they  were  married. 
Their  histories  are  simple.     His  shows  us  a  young  man  who 
did  not  particularly  want  to  be  an  actor  and  had  no  illusions 
about  a  trouper's  life.     His  father  had  conducted  stock  com- 
panies in  the  Colonies,  so  he  knew  about 
I,       Ti  i  c>  f  y       tne  hardships.     But  when  he  had  lost  one

BACK  STREET— Universal 


THE  story  and  spirit  of  Fannie  Hurst's  book  are  here  ex- 
quisitely translated  to  the  screen — and  we  can  hear  state 
censor  boards  groaning  with  rage  as  they  do  not  dare  to 
ruin,  with  their  clumsy  shears,  this  lovely  story  of  uncon- 
ventional love.  This  is  the  tale  of  a  seemingly  ordinary  girl 
forced  by  fate  to  tread  the  lonely  back  streets  of  life,  sac- 
rificing everything  for  her  man  and  becoming  a  character  of 
rare  beauty.  In  this  role  Irene  Dunne  rises  to  new  heights. 
She  can  make  the  hardest-boiled  shed  a  tear.  John  Boles 
does  his  best  work  as  the  young  banker  for  whom  the  girl 
stays  in  the  background,  content  to  see  him  rise  to  fame. 
The  motion  picture  in  one  of  its  finest  forms — a  story 
that  will  follow  you  from  the  theater,  tugging  at  your  heart- 
strings.   Do  not  cheat  yourself  by  missing  "Back  Street."

AMERICAN  MADNESS— Columbia 


HERE  is  the  first  picture  that  steps  up  and  seriously 
considers  that  little  situation  known  as  "The  Depres- 
sion. "  The  action  covers  twenty-four  hours.  Sounds  dull? 
Wait  until  you  see  it! 

Why,  the  run  on  the  bank  is  more  exciting  than  an  ad- 
vancing army!  And  the  scene  in  which  the  small  business 
men  rush  to  save  the  bank  by  depositing  their  profits  will 
bring  tears.  This  story  about  money  is  more  poignant  than 
most  of  the  sweetheart  hokum  of  the  day! 

Walter  Huston,  as  the  home-spun  banker  with  faith  in 
the  little  merchants,  gives  a  flawless,  delightful  performance. 

Pat  O'Brien  is  fine  as  the  chief  teller.  Kay  Johnson  and 
Constance  Cummings  turn  in  good  work — but  it's  the  pic- 
ture itself  that's  the  big  thing!    Don't  miss  it!

STRANGE  INTERLUDE— M-G-M 


NOT  as  rollicking  or  thrilling  film  entertainment  is  this 
picture  given  the  place  of  honor  among  the  month's 
productions.  But  Photoplay  goes  on  record  as  keenly  ap- 
preciating the  courage  and  ability  of  Louis  B.  Mayer  and 
Irving  Thalberg,  its  producers,  and  must  point  out  the 
significance  of  this  contribution  to  screen  art.  We  have  been 
reading  a  lot  of  criticism  from  screen  reviewers.  This  picture 
is  a  devastating  answer.  Get  behind  this  picture,  you  high- 
brow critics,  or  hold  your  peace.  See  this  picture,  fans,  and 
do  your  bit  to  encourage  men  who  dare  to  spend  a  fortune 
to  produce  such  a  radical  departure  from  screen  fare. 

Eugene  O'Neill  is  the  Pooh-Bah  of  theatrical  intellectuals. 
The  story  of  "Strange  Interlude"  is  a  morbid  one,  deficient 
in  the  action  of  the  medium  into  which  it  is  wonderfully 
translated.  It  is  a  tale  of  a  neurotic  woman  and  her  three 
lovers,  from  youth  to  old  age.  Its  pace  is  tedious  at  times. 
Its  adaptation,  direction  and  acting  are  superb.  Its  novelty 
is  the  utterance  of  unspoken  thoughts,  a  technical  and  at 
times  confusing  device,  but  intensely  interesting. 

Norma  Shearer  here  takes  her  place  among  the  great 
artists  of  her  day.  Clark  Gable  does  his  finest  technical  screen 
work  as  he  ages  over  a  period  of  forty  years.  Ralph  Morgan, 
Alexander  Kirkland  and  Robert  Young  share  honors.

*fo    MOVIE  CRAZY— Harold  Lloyd-Paramount 

HAROLD  LLOYD'S  first  in  two  years— and  the  best 
talkie  he's  made!  In  fact,  "Movie  Crazy,"  in  sheer 
movie  merit,  harks  back  to  the  spacious  days  of  "  Grand- 
ma's Boy"  and  "The  Freshman."  It's  a  ten-strike  for  the 
goggled  Harold  and  will  delight  his  fan  army,  which,  like 
the  elephants,  never  forgets.  Lloyd's  new  one  marks  a 
great  advance  in  the  use  of  comedy  dialogue.  It  never 
slows  down  the  action  nor  interferes  with  the  gags.  It  is,  as 
you  may  gather,  a  peach  of  a  picture. 

"  Movie  Crazy  "  tells  the  story  of  a  boy's  search  for  Holly- 
wood fame.  It  doesn't,  however,  satirize  pictures  and  pic- 
ture people.  Its  glamorous  background  helps  a  lot  in  build- 
ing up  the  romance  between  movie-mad  Harold  and  two 
actresses — one  excellently  played  by  Constance  Cummings; 
the  other  no  less  deftly  done  by  a  mysterious  Spanish  peach- 
erino.    Her  identity  isn't  disclosed  until  the  picture's  end. 

Harold,  himself,  turns  loose  a  burst  of  comedy  speed. 
The  film  has  six  brand-new  comic  sequences,  which  gives 
the  boy  the  world's  championship.  All  in  all,  a  red-hot 
credit  to  the  eternal  and  immortal  Lloyd. 

Also  in  the  cast  are  Kenneth  Thomson,  Louise  Closser 
Hale,  Spencer  Charters,  Mary  Doran  and  Robert  McWade 
— and  all  good.     Go  "  Movie  Crazy  " !

MR.  ROBINSON  CRUSOE— United  Artists 


HEY,  Rube  Goldberg,  this  Douglas  Fairbanks  is  stealing 
your  stuff!  He's  got  more  goofy  gadgets  on  that  South 
Sea  island  than  you've  got  in  a  month's  supply  of  your  car- 
toon inventions.  He's  got  a  turtle  that  pumps  water,  a 
monkey  that  milks  a  goat,  he's  got  hot  and  cold  running 
water  right  out  of  bamboo  faucets.  And  out  of  a  lot  of 
junk,  he  makes  a  radio  that  really  works! 

Take  the  little  woman  and  the  two  boys  to  see  it.  It 
is  Douglas  at  his  best.  Doug  makes  a  bet  that  if  they  put 
him  on  a  tropical  island  alone  he  can  have  a  penthouse  on 
Park  Avenue  with  all  the  modern  conveniences  within  two 
months.  And  what's  more,  he  does  it!  And  Rube,  not  a 
word  to  the  wife,  but  get  an  eyeful  of  that  hip-shaking 
Maria  Alba,  and  you  will  stow  away  on  a  ship  for  Tahiti!

THE  AGE  OF  CONSENT—  RKO-Radio 


ON  another  page  of  this  issue  is  a  short  story  about 
Dorothy  Wilson,  a  new  studio  heroine,  who  will  rank 
with  Olympic  winners  in  breaking  records.  She  shines  even 
in  contrast  with  two  grand  performances  by  Richard  Crom- 
well and  Eric  Linden,  and  for  looks  holds  her  own  with 
Arline  Judge.  Originally  called  "Fraternity  House,"  your 
reviewer  spoke  up  in  a  meeting  at  the  preview  and  de- 
nounced the  new  title  as  unworthy  of  the  film's  sincerity. 
The  action  takes  place  at  a  co-educational  college,  and 
Judge  Lindsey,  after  he  saw  the  film,  said  it  was  a  true 
diagnosis  of  our  educational  methods  —  long  on  text-book 
biology  but  short  on  the  problem  of  the  biological  urge  of  the 
students.  Splendid  entertainment, and  it  will  bring  about  the 
happy  culmination  of  more  than  one  prolonged  engagement.

A  GRAND  picture  for  everybody — mom  and  pop,  and  every

zestfully  through  famous  Culver  Military  Academy,  with  Tom 
Brown,  Richard  Cromwell  and  Ben  Alexander  fighting  nip  and 
tuck  for  acting  honors.  The  film  shows  men  in  the  making,  and

they  make  'em  good!

there's  a  nice  love  story,  too,  the  part  of  the  girl  being 
beautifully  done  by  Wynne  Gibson.  The  theme  isn't  new, 
but  you'll  like  this.

HERE'S  a  goofy  picture  that  stands  up  in  a  month  of  screen 
comedies.  Buster  Keaton  and  Jimmy  Durante  clown  their 
way  through  six  reels  of  hilarious  tomfoolery.  Buster  plays  a 
college  professor  in  charge  of  a  cheap  musical  show  and  Jimmy 
Durante  plays  a  marvelous  burlesque  of  himself.  And  oh,  is 
that  beautiful  Thelma  Todd  easy  to  look  at!  Save  enough  out

Monkey  Business/ 


(Editor's  note:  A  few  months  ago 
Leonard  Hall,  Photoplay's  ape  expert, 
or  expert  ape,  interviewed  one  Chita, 
dainty  chimp  belonging  to  Captain  Phi- 
fer.    The  lady  claimed  that  Johnny 

Weissmuller  stole  all  the  glory  from  her  in  "Tarzan,  the  Ape 
Man." 

Xow  appears  another  Chita,  a  chic  chimp  belonging  to  Major 
Bud  Barsky  of  Hollywood,  who  claims  that  only  she  or  he  was 
the  Simian  star  of  "Tarzan."  The  major's  Chita  has  the  law 
on  Cap's  Chita,  charging  plagiarism,  libel,  mayhem,  transport- 
ing narcotics,  breaking  glass  in  the  street  and  beating  Officer 
J.  McGinnis,  Shield  8080,  on  and  about  the  head  and  body 
with  some  blunt  instrument. 

The  case  was  threshed  out  in  court.    And  here  is  the'chaff.)

Carl  Laemmle  wants  me  for  "  The  Road 
Back  to  the  Poorhouse,"  and  Zukor — 
Attorney  for  Plaintiff — That's  all 
— swing  down  out  of  there.    Good  girl! 
Peanuts  I'll  give!    That's  my  case,  your 
honor. 

Justice  Doze — And  a  very  cute  case, 
too.  Send  one  around  to  my  place.  How 
about  this  other  Chita? 

Attorney  for  Defense — I  call  the 
other  Chita.

OLORES  DEL  RIO'S  contract  was  not  renewed  by 
|Radio  Pictures!" 

That  simple  news  item  appeared  in  a  Los  Angeles 
paper  recently.     Behind   the  brief  sentence  lies  a 
tragic  and  poignant  story. 

Dolores  is  the  epitome  of  natural  beauty  and  is  the  type  of 
woman  about  whom  poets  have  raved  for  generations. 

She  has  never  attempted  to  be  anything  but  what  nature 
intended  her  to  be;  has  imitated  no  one;  used  no  artifices  to 
enhance  her  native  charms. 

Her  raven  hair  has  never  known  curling-iron  or  finger-wave. 
She  has  always  (and  still  does!)  pulled  her  hair  back  from  her 
forehead  and  parted  it  in  the  middle,  in  the  straight,  severe 
lines  typical  of  the  high-class  Spanish  Senorita.  It  has  never 
been  cut. 

Her  eyebrows  are  natural,  too.  She  plucks  only  a  few  stray 
ones  near  the  eyelid.  She  has  never  arched  or  shaped  them, 
and  they  are  fully  one-half  inch  thick.  Her  long  lashes  are 
likewise  her  own.     No  stuck-on-with-glue   additions. 

She  uses  neither  powder  nor  rouge  on  the  screen  or  off. 
Once  in  a  while,  she  reddens  her  lips.  But  the  color  is  applied 
on  the  natural  curve  of  her  mouth.  Of  course,  only  a  woman 
as  radiantly  beautiful  as  Dolores  can  get  away  with  all  that. 
It's  all  right  for  Dolores,  but  not  for  girls  less  richly  endowed 
with  good  looks. 

In  other  words,  her  dark  beauty  is  one  hundred  per  cent 
her  own.  The  artificialities  of  our  new  "Shady  Dames"  (we 
told  you  about  them  last  month)  are  completely  foreign  to  her. 

Two  years  ago  Photoplay  conducted  a  search  for  the  most 
perfect  feminine  figure  in  Hollywood.  Our  judges  were  medical 
men,  artists,  designers.  Their  unanimous  choice  was  Dolores 
Del  Rio. 

Dolores  still  has  her  lovely  figure.     She  still  has  the 
beauty.    But  she  is  without  a  contract. 

DOLORES  is  the  outstanding  and  tragic  example  of  what 
happens  when  producers  take  an  unknown  girl  and  launch 
her  as  a  star  immediately.  She  is  the  living  proof  that  girls  must 
grow  to  stardom  through  shrewd,  careful  and  intelligent  train- 
ing. They  must  learn  to  crawl  before  they  walk;  walk  before 
they  run.  They  cannot  be  skyrocketed  to  lasting  fame,  even 
though  they  possess  the  greatest  beauty  and  talent. 

Her  case  is  also  an  example  of  what  happens  to  stars 
who  play  exclusively  in  million  dollar  productions. 
Million  dollar  spectacles  seldom  make  money.  Al- 
though the  star  is  not  to  blame  for  the  extravagances 
of  these  productions,  she  automatically  receives  the 
censure.  "Oh  yes,  Dolores  is  a  grand  actress;  she's  a 
great  beauty— but  her  pictures  never  make  money." 

Her  last  picture  for  Radio,  "Bird  of  Paradise,"  is  a 
perfect  example.  She  does  splendid  work  and 
reaches  the  same  heights  she  did  in  "Ramona."  The 
picture  is  good  entertainment.  But  it  cost  more  than 
a  million  dollars!  It  can't  possibly  make  that  money 
back. 

A  cast  of  forty-five  was  taken  to  Hawaii  on  location 
and  lodged  at  the  ultra-expensive  Royal  Hotel  for  a 
month  and  a  half.  When  the  company  returned  to 
the  United  States,  the  production  costs  were  already 
$450,000  and  not  one  scene  of  the  first  half  of  the 
picture   had  been   taken. 

Not  Dolores'  fault,  certainly,  but  it  was  her 
picture.  Another  Del  Rio  picture  would  not  make 
money,    they   said. 

If  Dolores  had  not  been  starred,  but  built  to  popu- 
larity little  by  little  instead,  she  would  not  have  been 
blamed.  [  please  turn  to  page  96  ] 


Dolores  Del  Rio  is  one  of  the  few 
absolutely  natural  beauties  in 
Hollywood.  She  is  also  a  fine 
actress,  yet  upon  the  recent 
completion  of  "Bird  of  Paradise," 
her  contract  was  not   renewed 


Being  stamped  as  "a  million 
dollar  baby"  has  almost  cost 
Dolores  Del  Rio  her  career

Here's  Harold  Lloyd's  nine-hole  private  golf 
course.  During  this  time  of  depression  and 
while  he  is  busy  putting  final  touches  on  his 
new  picture,  he  would  give  it  up — but  he 
doesn't,  since  it  would  throw  men  out  of  work 


MILDRED  and  Harold  Lloyd  live  in  a 
palace.  There  is  no  getting  around  that 
— and  who  would  want  to?  The  fairy- 
land twenty  acres  are  landscaped  and 
gardened  and  floralled  until  one  thinks  of  famed 
Versailles  and  velvet  swards  and  jewelled  foun- 
tains and  avenues  of  flowers  where  kings  have 
walked.  Within  the  mansion  is  such  luxury  and 
warmth  and  beauty  and  color  as  might  strike  awe 
to  the  costliest  heart. 
Yet  no  awe  is  struck. 

For  within  this  castle  two  bungalow-dwellers- 
at-heart  play  at  house.  Two  home-makers,  two 
simple  children-loving,  friend-loving  young  people 
keep  budgets,  practice  economies,  petty  and  enor- 
mous, plan  and  work  and  consider  "tomorrow" 
as  do  any  young  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Man-and-Wife  in 
any  bungalow  court  or  small  apartment  in  the  land. 

Harold  set  the  pace  the  very  first  night  they  dined  in  their 
new  home.  He  came  to  dinner  in  his  bathrobe.  And  not  a 
very  elegant  bathrobe  at  that.  The  kind  of  bathrobe  any 
young  husband's  mother-in-law  might  have  given  him,  with  a 
grunt,  the  Christmas  before  last.  And  if  you  could  see  that 
dining-room  with  its  sumptuous  gold  brocade  hangings,  its  deep- 
piled,  sea-green  carpet,  its  sheen  of  priceless  polished  wood  (the 
table  cost  $5,000),  Raymond,  the  Major-domo,  in  full  evening 
toggery  and  manner  to  match,  you  would  get  the  full  value  of 
Harold's  gesture. 

Harold  said  to  me,  "  This  is  our  home.  I'm  going  to  be  com- 
fortable in  it.  I'm  going  to  wear  what  I  please  when  I  please. 
When  I  come  home  from  the  studio  at  night,  or  from  golf  or 
wherever  I  happen  to  be,  I'm  tired.  I  want  to  relax.  I  want 
to  be  myself.  And  I  can't  relax  in  a  museum.  It's  got  to  be  a 
home.  And  a  heck  of  a  home  it  would  be  if  I  had  to  'live  up' 
to  my  surroundings.  I'll  make  my  surroundings  fit  mc.  Now 
and  then  Mid  dresses  for  dinner.  She  does  it  because  she  likes 
to  look  pretty  for  me.  She  would  do  the  same  in  a  log  cabin  or 
in  a  beach  shack.  Now  and  then  we  give  a  small  party.  I  tell 
the  boys  to  dress  if  they  feel  that  way  about  it,  but  to  wear 


Amid  all  the  grandeur  of  his  home,  Harold  spends  his  evenings 
in  a  comfortable  sweater,  reading  —  mostly  mystery  thrillers. 
And  he  doesn't  dress  for  dinner,  either.  Sometimes  Mildred 
does,  but  that's  just  because  she  likes  to  look  pretty  for  him 


soft-collared  shirts  and  be  comfy.  It's  swell  to  live  in  the  midst 
of  beauty,  but  you  don't  have  to  be  a  stuffed  shirt  to  do  it. " 
At  almost  any  hour  of  any  day  you  may  "  run  in  "  on  Mildred. 
You'll  find  her  sewing,  more  likely  than  not,  in  her  small  and 
exquisite  dressing  room.  She'll  be  clad  in  a  simple  gingham 
frock,  priced  S3. 95,  with  a  S5.95  coolie  coat  flung  over  it. 
Gloria  and  Peggy  will  be  tumbling  over  her,  begging  for  a  piece 
of  cake  or  a  piece  of  candy.  Harold,  Jr.,  will  be  parked  on  the 
floor  at  her  feet  playing  with  his  favorite  toy  telephone.  And 
you'll  forget  that  you  are  in  what  is  undoubtedly  the  most 
gorgeously  expensive  home  in  all  Hollywood  and  think  only  of 
the  home  it  is,  of  the  warm  and  homely  living  that  pervades. 

ON  last  Easter  eve,  for  instance,  we  dropped  in  to  see  the 
Lloyds.  The  Major-domo,  elegant  in  coat-tails,  said  that 
Madame  was  in  the  kitchen.  Mildred  giggles  and  says.  "  It's 
fun  to  be  called  'Madame'!"  We  trouped  into  the  kitchen  and 
there  were  Harold  and  Mildred  and  Mildred's  mother  and  dad 
and  aunt,  and  all  of  them  were  dyeing  Easter  eggs  with  the 
most  intense  absorption.  The  majority  of  Hollywoodians  were 
dancing  on  each  other's  feet  at  the  Mayfair  that  night.  The 
Lloyds  were  in  the  kitchen! 


By 

Gladys 
Hall 


The  Harold  Lloyds  al- 
low themselves  the 
luxury  of  a  magnificent 
home,  but  Harold 
knows  where  every 
cent  needed  to  manage 
it  goes.  He  checks 
over  the  bills  himself 
and  keeps  a  budget. 
Just  look  at  that 
beautiful  living-room 


And  how  does  Mama  Mildred  occupy  herself  in  their  palace? 
Skilful  herself,  she  teaches  the  children  to  make  hooked  rugs. 
That's  Peggy,  the  adopted  daughter,  with  bobbed  hair.  Gloria 
(right)  is  their  own  child.    And  the  love  given  them  is  equal 


Mildred  could  so  easily  have  had  the  maids  perform  this  task 
for  her.  But  not  Mid!  "Why,  it  wouldn't  be  any  fun!"  she 
said. 

Harold,  that  night,  was  perched  tailor  fashion  upon  the 
kitchen  sink,  a  large  apron  hung  about  his  neck,  very  pleased 
with  himself  because  he  was  dyeing  his  eggs  in  smart,  solid 
colors. 

And,  again,  you  forgot  your  surroundings.  The  huge  and 
serried  ranks  of  electrical  ice-boxes.  The  metal,  shining-topped 
tables.  The  uniformed  maids,  capped  and  gowned  and  smiling, 
in  the  background.  You  saw  only  people,  the  blonde  and  eager 
figure  of  Mid,  the  bent  and  eager  figure  of  Harold,  deep  in  a 
task  other  mothers  and  fathers  were  performing  in  the  same 
eager  fashion  the  country  over  wherever  mothers  and  fathers 
live  in  a  home. 

THIS  boy  Harold,  who  started  life  in  a  small  frame  cottage  in 
a  mid- Western  town,  who  sold  newspapers  and  was  usher  in 
a  theater,  whose  father  clerked  in  a  shoe  store  and  whose 
mother  worked  in  a  millinery  shop  to  make  the  lean  ends  meet, 
has  never  got  entirely  away  from  his  average-American  boy- 
hood.   He  still  remembers  the  days  when  he  wanted  a  bicycle 


with  every  beat  of  his  small  heart — and  couldn't 
have  one.  He  remembers  the  Christmases  when, 
under  a  stringy  tree,  two  or  three  cheap  toys  made 
brave  display. 

But  he  knows  what  money  is  worth.  He  knows 
that  nothing  it  can  buy  is  so  precious,  so  vital  as 
the  things  it  does  buy  for  himself  and  for  his 
family — Home.  The  simple  pleasures,  the  simple 
contentments.  If  you  can  have  the  other  things, 
too,  Harold  says,  the  luxuries,  the  beauties,  the 
softnesses  of  living — fine.  But  if  there  had  to  be 
a  choice,  Harold  Lloyd  would  give  up  the  luxu- 
ries and  the  softnesses  without  hesitation  for 
Mildred's  wholesome  zest,  for  the  laughter  of 
his  three  children,  for  the  unpretentiousness  of 
living  he  maintains  in  his  palace  of  a  home. 

His  one  and  only  extravagance  has  been  this 
house.    And  they  have  made  this  house — a  home. 

NO  small  house  in  any  suburb,  subsisting  on  a 
meagre  salary  per  week,  is  more  carefully 
budgeted,  more  carefully  run  than  is  the  home  cf 
the  young  Lloyds.  Mildred  and  Harold  know 
every  detail  of  the  housekeeping,  every  item  of  the  expendi- 
tures. The  servant  problem  has  been  estimated  and  worked 
out  down  to  the  last  gardener.  There  are  nine  in  help  in  the 
Lloyd  house  itself.  The  cook  and  her  assistant  are  two.  The 
Major-domo  and  the  man  under  him  make  four.  There  are  two 
nurses,  one  for  the  baby  and  one  for  the  little  girls,  making  six. 
Two  upstairs  girls  make  eight  and  one  house-boy  to  fill  wood 
boxes,  wash  windows  and  do  other  small  chores  makes  the  nine. 
Outside,  there  is  a  pool  boy  in  constant  attendance,  two 
chauffeurs  and  eighteen  gardeners.  The  indoor  help  are  the 
only  ones  who  eat  on  the  estate.  The  outside  help  eat  in  their 
own  homes. 

"  The  household  bills,"  Harold  told  me,  "are  taken  care  of  by 
my  studio  secretary.  Every  month  I  go  over  them  myself,  item 
for  item.  I  know  what  we  pay  for  butter  per  pound.  I  know 
the  price  of  eggs  and  when  these  prices  go  up  a  cent  or  two,  or 
go  down.  I  know  the  price  of  beef  per  pound,  and  the  prices  of 
lamb  and  veal  and  poultry.  If  the  bills  of  one  month  exceed  the 
bills  of  the  month  before  I  find  out  why.  I  question  the  extra 
amount  of  butter  used,  for  instance.  I  want  to  know  why  we 
have  used  four  dozen  more  eggs  this  month  than  we  used  last. 
If  the  bills  sky-rocket  too  high  I   [  please  turn  to  page  104  ]

They  came  to  see 
Crawford,  but 
they  remained  to 
rave  about  red- 
headed,blue-eyed 
William  Gargan 


He  plays  the  tough 
marine  opposite 
Joan's  Sadie 
Thompson  in 
"Rain."  He  comes 
from  the  New  York 
stage  but  when  you 
see  him  in  that  pic- 
ture, you'll  never 
let  Bill  Gargan  go 
back  to  Broadway 


He  Xjpset  Joan's  Larty 


HAVE  you  heard  of  William  Gargan?  Well,  don't  be 
discouraged.  You  will.  So  don't  say  you  haven't 
been  warned.  For  this  Gargan  man — 
Well,  first  let  me  tell  you.  You  see,  Joan  Crawford 
and  company  were  over  at  Catalina  putting  good  old  Sadie 
Thompson  through  her  paces  for  "Rain." 

And  as  Catalina  is  quite  a  watery  distance  out  in  the  Pacific 
from  Hollywood,  the  usual  newspaper  men,  magazine  writers 
and  so  on,  couldn't  get  round  to  get  much  news. 

So  United  Artists  decided  something  had  to  be  done  about  it. 

Practically  every  member  of  the  press,  with  wives  and  sweet- 
hearts, were  loaded  on  Joseph  Schenck's  well  nourished  yacht 
and  taken  for  a  boat  ride.  They  were  on  their  way  to  see  Joan. 
Half-way  there,  several  reporters  were  waving  bye-bye  to 
leaping  porpoises  and  confiding  to  flying  fish  they  were  going 
to  see  Joan.     Whoops-de-whoops. 

Joan,  with  her  grand  smile  and  ready  hand-clasp  was  waiting 
to  meet  us.     Wore  gorgeous  than  ever. 

Feminine  hearts  sank  ten  miles  in  two  seconds. 

Then  suddenly,  there  he  was.  On  the  top  step  of  Joe  Horn's 
old  general  store.  He  stood  there  in  that  marine  uniform,  look- 
ing down.  A  strapping  lad  of  six  feet,  blue  eyes,  his  marine 
hat  tilted  at  a  wicked  angle,  revealing  a  glimpse  of  reddish- 
brown  hair.  His  blue  eyes  twinkling  at  the  open  mouths  below. 
A  slap-him-down  slayer  with  a  bit  of  Irish  about  him.  Beat 
that  combination! 

There  stood  William.  And  the  feminine  press  of  Hollywood, 
as  one,  claimed  him  for  their  own.  Husbands,  sweethearts  and 
unattached  males  completely  forgotten.  They  bombarded  the 
publicity  man  with  questions.  Who  is  he?  Where  did  he  come 
from?  Why  have  we  never  seen  him  in  Hollywood?  And  what 
was  the  idea  of  holding  out  on  us  like  this? 

And  then  it  developed  that  William  Gargan  was  born  in 
Brooklyn,  and  was  taken  out  of  the  cast  of  "The  Animal  King- 
dom" with  Leslie  Howard  on  the  New  York  stage,  to  play  the 
part  of  the  hard-boiled  marine  who  loves  Sadie  in  "Rain.' 

He  had  been  there  seven  long  weeks 
and  had  never  yet  seen  Hollywood.    He       ft  <\r       T  o  n   n 
had  been  rushed  from  the  train  to  the      **  J      J  V  U,  II

Catalina  boat.  And  the  romantic  scar,  it  was  explained,  had 
been  added  after  he  arrived.  He  was  just  so  darned  handsome 
something  had  to  be  done  to  make  him  more  suitable  for  the  part. 
He  has  been  a  little  of  everything— including  private  detec- 
tive—and he  went  on  the  stage  when  the  detecting  business 
wasn't  so  good.  "Aloma  of  the  South  Seas"  was  the  first  thing 
he  did.  He  didn't  do  much  acting  in  that — just  put  on  a  brown 
make-up  from  head  to  foot  every  night.  Try  it  some  time  and 
see  how  you  like  it.  But  that  wasn't  all  he  had  to  do.  The 
stage  manager  needed  a  little  assisting.  Bill  assisted  by  work- 
ing a  complicated  storm  scene  that  kept  him  busier  than  a  shop 
girl  at  a  penny  sale.  For  all  this  labor — brown  make-up  and 
everything — he  got  thirty  dollars  a  week. 

BUT  that  gave  the  Broadway  folks  an  idea.  Whenever  there 
was  a  real  hard  job  to  be  done  they  thought  of  this  Gargan 
fellow.  It  was  in  a  Theater  Guild  production  that  a  member  of 
the  cast  lightly  tossed  him  off  a  ship  into  thirteen  inches  of 
water  every  night.  Outside  of  a  slight  limp  and  a  couple  of 
bruises  in  vital  spots,  Bill  faired  well  enough  in  that  job.  He 
doesn't  limp  any  more. 

There's  this  to  be  said.  At  least  he's  not  going  to  mind  the 
hard  work  in  Hollywood.  Bill  has  had  hard  work  and  he  isn't 
afraid  of  it.  But  what  he  wasn't  prepared  for  was  the  way  the 
press  fell  for  him — all  in  a  heap. 

The  feminine  writers  followed  him  about  in  a  pack.  He 
scarcely  seemed  aware  of  their  existence.  But  did  it  discourage 
them?'  It  did  not! 

Three  husbands  wandered  dejectedly  down  to  the  beach  and 
sat  idly  watching  the  sad,  sad  waves.  Darn  it  all,  they  liked 
him  themselves. 

So  what  started  out  to  be  a  serenade  to  Joan  turned  out  to  be 
a  hysterical  outburst  over  William  Gargan. 

You'll  see  him  soon  and  you'll  learn  why  feminine  Holly- 
wood   went    completely  Gar-gan.      He's  gone  over  to  Radio 
Pictures  on  a  seven-year  contract  and  will  make  "The  Animal 
Kingdom"  next.

Three  Youthful  Fashion  Pointers 


LONG  live  the  short  jacket  says  Holly- 
wood! And  Susan  Fleming  recom- 
mends this  one  she  wears  in  "Million 
Dollar  Legs"  for  college  wardrobes.  It 
is  one  of  those  abbreviated  ones  that  has 
earned  itself  the  name  of  a  "bellhop" 
jacket.  Susan's  is  yellow  chamoisette 
with  brass  buttons.  Blue  wool  fashions 
the  slightly  flared  skirt.  And  that 
knitted  cap  which  looks  like  the  kind 
you  used  to  wear  skating,  is  also  blue 
and  yellow.  Several  such  jackets  in 
various  colors  and  materials  would  make 
one  skirt  look  like  a  number  of  costumes. 
This  in  leather  would  be  a  grand  idea, 
too.    Why  not  copy  it? 


SUSAN  FLEMING  is  going  to  start  some  new  fads 
with  the  young  set  this  fall.  This  young  star 
wears  some  of  the  cleverest  clothes  you  ever  saw  in 
her  new  picture,  "Million  Dollar  Legs."  Each  cos- 
tume has  some  new  twist  worth  copying — a  belt,  an 
unusual  collar,  a  different  color  scheme.  Three  of  her 
costumes  are  shown  here — don't  miss  a  detail.  New 
clothes  are  slim  and  young-looking,  you  know.  There 
are  trick  details  in  necklines  and  sleeves.  Waist- 
lines are  still  high,  as  you  like  them.  And  there's 
loads  of  flattering  fur  on  everything.  Many  silks  look 
as  if  they  were  masquerading  as  woolens.  Watch 
the  new  pictures  for  clever,  original  trends. 


A  TRICKY  belt  is  this  one  above, 
of  brown  suede  trimmed  with 
big  metal  discs.  Susan  wears  it 
with  beige  crepe.  Those  buttons 
are  mere  trimming,  the  dress  really 
opens  with  a  slide  fastener! 

A  PERFECT  suit  for  fall  is  this  of 
/\  blue  ostrich  tweed  which 
Susan  Fleming  wears  in  her  new 
picture.  Interest  centers  about 
the  fur  trimmed  neckline  and 
flounce  of  the  jacket.  That  second 
row  of  fur  on  the  collar  is  a  little 
detachable  cape  of  sable — this 
detachable  fur  idea  continues  to  be 
one  of  the  cleverest  fashion  ideas 
in  seasons.      Notice  how  the   fur

FLORENCE    ELDRIDGE,    who    is    Mrs. 

I  Fredric  March,  you  know,  will  be 
seen  wearing  this  charming  dinner  gown 
at  left,  in  "Thirteen  Women."'  The  dress 
is  a  sheer  black  crepe  with  top  of  Valen- 
ciennes lace  and  is  posed  over  a  black 
satin  slip,  the  hem  of  which  is  also  edged 
with  the  lace.  This  gown  is  a  perfect 
illustration  of  the  simple  type  of  formal 
costume  which  will  be  much  worn  this 
season.  The  covered  shoulder  line  is  an 
important  detail — and  note  the  slim  line 
of  the  skirt.  The  pendant  clip  at  the  neck- 
line is  a  further  mark  of  good  taste

When  you  see  Irene  Dunne  in 
"Thirteen  Women"  be  sure  to  no- 
tice how  ingeniously  the  daisies  are 
placed  on  her  dull  cr'pe  hostess 
gown.  A  sketch  of  the  front  and 
back  of  this  gown  is  shown,  above. 
Yellow  daisies  with  brown  centers 
are  used  in  a  single  row,  rising  to  a 
point  at  front.  In  back  they  are 
massed  at  the  low  decolletage  in 
double  formation. 


r^LAUDETTE  COLBERT  is  French  by  birth  so 
^ —  she  has  that  flair  for  chic  which  is  universally 
attributed  to  her  countrywomen.  In  regard  to 
jewelry,  Gaudette  has  very  definite  ideas — ideas 
which  are  dramatically  illustrated  in  the  photo- 
graph and  sketch,  at  right.  For  instance,  with 
rhinestone  earrings,  no  necklace  but  clips  are  per- 
missible. And  she,  like  so  many  other  smart 
screen  stars,  likes  to  wear  a  sparkling  bracelet  or 
two  over  her  evening  glove.  The  glove  is  black 
suede  and  her  stunning  frock  is  black  crepe  roma.

WHO  doesn't  wait  eagerly  for  every  new 
Constance  Bennett  picture  to  give  new  and 
wearable  style  tips?  In  "Two  Against  the 
World/'  her  latest  picture,  you  are  not  going  to 
be  disappointed.  I  have  sketched  an  evening 
wrap  and  the  dress  that  accompanies  the  en- 
semble partly  shown  in  the  picture  above.  The 
coat  is  a  soft  wool  trimmed  with  fox  and  has 
sleeves  with  elastic  bands  at  the  wrists  to  make 
them  adjustable.  The  dress  is  shown  in  the 
sketch,  at  right.  It  is  the  same  fabric  and  has  a 
tricky  scarf  of  dull  white  crepe.  The  hat  is 
stitched  fabric — a  smart  touch.  The  black  velvet 
evening  wrap  endorses  the  long,  slender  sil- 
houette fitted  at  the  waist. 


SNT  it  nice  to  have  Lila  Lee  backagain?  And 
especially  looking  as  slim  and  stunning  as  she 
does  in  "War  Correspondent."'  This  suit  is  one 
of  the  interesting  outfits  she  wears.  The  jacket 
has  a  pointed  line  at  back  and  front.  A  collar  of 
blue  fox  is  cleverly  arranged.  The  skirt  has  a 
wide  belt,  boned  in  front,  to  give  a  high  waist- 
line. Although  this  suit  is  a  light  beige  wool,  it 
could  be  copied  in  a  heavier  and  darker  material 
for  fall.  A  deep  green  or  the  new  dark  brown, 
perhaps.

Four  New  Screen  Style  Notes 


SO  much  interest  is  directed  at 
the  necklines  in  the  new  screen 
clothes.  Karen  Morley  who  has 
established  a  reputation  for  look- 
ing smart,  uses  white  organdie 
to  trim  the  neckline  of  this  black 
cloth  frock  she  wears  in  "Wash- 
ington Masquerade."'  Not  only 
her  collar  line  has  the  touch  of 
white  but  also  the  sleeve  cuffs — 
and  a  large  flower  of  the  same 
fabric  is  posed  close  to  the  neck 
on  the  left  shoulder.  Karen's  hat 
is  black  felt  in  pancake  shape. 


THERE'S  a  wintry  look  to  this  black 
broadcloth  coat  which  Karen  Morley 
also  wears  in  "Washington  Masquerade." 
A  huge  collar  brought  down  in  front  with 
wide  lapels  has  the  air  of  the  military  top- 
coats Garbo  has  immortalized.  The  luxuri- 
ous mink  fur  gives  it  a  very  feminine  look, 
however.  And  the  wide  flaring  cuffs  of 
fur  givea  graceful  line  to  the  sleeves.  Note 
how  almost  form-fitting  this  coat  is — a  most 

Copular  silhouette  trend  for  fall.  The 
utton  fastening  is  a  knowing  style  detail. 
You  will  find  a  great  deal  of  fur  is  bulked 
at  the  top  of  coats — to  give  that  wide- 
shouldered  effect.  The  tiny  hat  is  a  fitting 
accompaniment  for  these  large  collared 
coats.  And  broadcloth  is  one  of  the  best 
coat  fabrics.

Here's  the  way  Mary  Pickford's  table 
looks  when  she  gives  one  of  the  delight- 
fully informal  formal  parties  for  which 
she  and  Doug  are  noted.  You  can  copy 
many  of  Mary's  ideas.  The  cloth  is  gold- 
colored  linen,  the  service  crystal  and  sil- 
ver. There's  a  printed  menu  (you  can 
have  them  at  very  small  cost  for  your 
more  elaborate  dinners)  and  cigarettes 
near  every  place.  Just  study  the  individ- 
ual set-up  carefully.   It's  the  last  word 


By   Lois    Shirley 


Have  you,  for  instance,  considered  the  gorgeous  effects  that 
can  be  attained  with  the  new  colored  linens?  Mary's  cloth  was 
gold-colored  with  gold-colored  napkins  and  candles.  The  flat 
table  silver  and  the  crystal  service  gleamed  richly  against  that 
background.     An  elegant  effect,  achieved  by  simple  means. 

Printed  menus  were  placed  about  the  table  at  various  points. 

Hors  d'auvres  consisting  of  cheese  puffs,  anchovy  canapes, 
caviar  canapes  and  tomato  juice  cocktails  were  served  in  the 
drawing-room  before  dinner. 

Mary's  menu  (and  it's  a  good  one  to  copy)  began  with  con- 
somme Julienne,  celery,  olives,  radishes,  enchiladas  and  fried 
bananas  (try  the  fried  bananas  by  all  means).  Then  roast  lamb 
with  mint  sauce,  vegetables,  rainbow  salad  made  of  chicory, 
endive,  water-cress,  romaine  lettuce,  chopped  eggs  and  French 
dressing.  There  were  chocolate  rolls  and  mints  for  dessert. 
Coffee  was  served  in  the  drawing-room. 

People,  even  those  in  Hollywood,  have  the  weirdest  ideas 
about  parties  at  Pickfair.  They  imagine  dukes  and  duchesses, 
counts  and  countesses  bowing  formally  from  eight  o'clock  till 
one.    Until  there  isn't  another  bow  left  in  their  systems. 

What's  the  fun,  people  wonder? 

Lots  of  fun.  There's  a  grand  sense  of  informality  at  Mary 
and  Doug's.  People  have  grand  times.  Doug  usually  puts  on 
a  show  that  is  hard  to  equal. 


Even  the  guests  are  seized  with  the  uncontrollable  urge  to 
do  monkey  shines  and  eventually  find  themselves  clad  in  one 
of  Doug's  old  movie  costumes,  cutting  comical  capers.  It's 
fun.    And  there's  the  success  of  a  Pickfair  party. 

The  famous  Shri  Meher  Babo,  who  hasn't  spoken  a  word  for 
seven  years  and  couldn't  out-talk  Doug  even  if  he  tried,  was 
there  to  amuse  the  guests  at  this  particular  party.  With  his 
alphabetical  board,  Shri  Meher  Babo  read  their  future.  Not 
a  dull  moment. 

A  MARION  DA  VIES  party  means  something  out  of  the 
ordinary.  Marion  goes  for  Hard  Times  Parties — and 
couldn't  we  all?  Guests  must  wear  old,  discarded  clothing,  the 
get-ups  of  the  arriving  guests  throwing  everyone  into  hysterics 
for  hours. 

Then,  too,  Marion  gives  her  famous  baby  party  once  every 
year.  Picture  to  yourself  the  very  plump  Mr.  Brown  (the  bank 
president)  in  rompers,  or  the  sniffing  Mrs.  Van  Dyke-Brown  in 
a  ruffle  to  the  knees  and  a  blue  sash,  and  get  ready  to  send  out 
those  invitations. 

Or,  how  about  a  horseback  party  for  the  early  fall  days? 
Does  your  set  like  to  ride?  Good.  Marion  gave  just  such  a 
party  last  week,  and  it  was  grand.

If  You  Have  A  Good 

It/ 


DON'T  fall  over  backwards  (al- 
though it  would  be  a  good  exer- 
i  ise  at  that  I  when  I  tell  you  I'm 
not  going  to  bawl  you  out  this 
month — well,  not  much,  maybe  just  a 
little  bit  along  toward  the  end  of  this 
article. 

The  reason  I'm  not  going  to  give  you 
one  of  my  big,  riproaring  lectures,  is  be- 
cause most  of  you  have  been  so  good, 
followed  my  instructions  so  carefully 
and  are  at  the  point  where  you  want  to 
know  what  to  do  with  that  good  figure 
now  that  you've  got  it. 

Don't  think  for  a  minute  that  you  can 
lie  down  on  the  job  and  give  up  your 
exercises  and  diets  just  because  you've 
reduced  or  built  yourself  up  to  the 
weight  you  want  to  be.  The  time  has 
come  to  work  and  work  hard  to  keep 
what  you've  gained. 

And  this  goes  for  you  girls  with  natu- 
rally good  figures.  There  are  plenty  of 
you.  I  get  your  letters  telling  me  that 
you  take  some  of  my  exercises  just  to 
keep  healthy,  but  that  there's  nothing 
wrong  with  your  hips  and  waistline.  To 
you  I  say,  now  is  the  time  to  preserve 
and  keep  that  figure.  If  you  don't 
watch  out,  Old  Lady  Age  will  come 
creeping  up  on  you.  There's  no  reason 
for  you  to  get  old.  I'm  over  fifty  and 
I've  as  much  pep  and  vitality  as  a  girl  of 
twenty — more  than  a  lot  of  girls  of 
twenty  I  know — the  lazy  things! 

TO  keep  the  good  figure  that  you  al- 
ready have  or  that  your  work  with  me 
has  brought  you,  you've  got  to  stimulate 
your  ambition  to  be  young  in  spirit. 
And  then  start  watching  out  for  danger 
signals.  The  first,  and  most  important, 
danger  sign  is  in  the  abdomen.  Take  a 
look  at  that  old  lady  who  lives  in  your 
block.  She  may  be  fat  or  she  may  be 
thin,  but  I'll  wager  that  she  has  a  big 
stomach.  You've  got  to  watch  the 
abdomen.  It's  the  keynote  of  a  good 
figure  and  most  of  your  grace  and  beauty 
hinges  upon  it.  You  owe  it  to  yourself 
and  to  your  friends  to  keep  the  lovely 
figure  you  have. 

Si i,  on  these  pages  you'll  find  the  best 
abdomen  exercise  in  the  world.  Get 
your  kid  brother  or  sister  or  your  hus- 
band, mother,  father  or  a  friend  to  work 
with  you  on  this  exercise.  And  you  folks 
with  lumpy,  bad  figures  or  you  who 
haven't  gone  right  through  with  me  in 
my  course  of  instructions — it's  grand 
for  you.  too. 

It  is  almost  harder  to  keep  a  good 
figure  good,  than  to  make  a  bad  figure 
good.  The  reason  is  that  when  you  look 
at  yourself  in  the  mirror  and  see  yourself 
sloppy  and  fat  and  awful, you  say,  "I've

To  Take  Lump  of  Flesh  Off  Back  of  Neck

got  to  do  something  about  myself.'' 
You're  shamed  into  getting  off  those 
pounds.  But  when  you  see  a  nice,  slim 
figure  reflected  you  say,  "I  look  nice. 
There's  no  need  to  worry." 

Well,  that's  where  you're  dead  wrong. 
You  do  need  to  worry.  Now  let  that 
picture  in  the  mirror  fade  and  imagine 
yourself  twenty  or  even  ten  years  from 
now.  That  ought  to  put  the  fear  of 
Sylvia  in  you.  So  buck  up  and  start 
today,  at  once,  to  keep  lovely. 

THE  second  danger  signal  is  the  waist- 
line. As  you  grow  older — I  mean  as 
you  change  from  twenty-five  to  thirty, 
you'll  be  inclined  to  slump  and  as  you 
slump,  your  stomach  will  stick  out  and 
your  waistline  will  enlarge.  I  know  this — 
I've  seen  it  happen  too  many  times.  The 
best  exercise  possible  for  the  waistline  is 
dancing — just  dancing  a  gay  little  fox- 
trot either  around  your  own  room  alone 
or  with  a  partner  at  a  dance.  But — 
there  are  two  ways  to  dance.  One  of 
them  gives  you  a  good  figure,  the  other 
will  spoil  it.  I  show  you  this  month  the 
right  and  wrong  way  to  hold  yourself 
when  you  dance.  Now  see  that  you 
study  the  pictures  and  live  up  to  my  in- 
structions. 

Whether  you  dance  a  lot  in  the  eve- 
ning or  not.  be  sure  to  dance  at  least  one 
hour  every  day  to  the  radio  or  just  hum- 
ming a  little  tune  by  yourself.  That 
dancing  is  absolutely  necessary  to  the 
preservation  of  your  figure.  You  can't 
get  along  without  it!  Look  what  danc- 
ing has  done  for  Joan  Crawford's  figure, 
and  Joan  dances  the  right  way. 

This  hour's  dancing  gives  you  pep, 
poise  and  vitality.  It  makes  you  alive, 
if  you  put  your  whole  heart  and  soul 
into  it  as  you  should.  Then,  no  matter 
how  plain  your  face  is,  you  will  arrest 
attention  with  the  spring  of  your  walk, 
your  energy  and  your  lithe,  graceful 
figure. 

The  third  danger  signal  to  a  lovely 
figure  is  the  lump  on  the  back  of  the 
neck— you  know  that  little  bit  of  fat 
that  ruins  a  nice  back.  If  it  h?.s  reached 
a  very  advanced  stage,  you  can  squeeze 
it  off  with  your  fingers,  as  I've  already 
told  you  how  to  do  to  get  rid  of  lumps: 
but  I  show  you  an  exercise  this 
month  that  will  keep  it  off.  Do  this 
exercise  every  morning  of  your  life  with- 
out  fail.  Of  course,  what  makes  the 
lump  is  a  wrong  standing  and  walking 
position.     If  you  keep  your  shoulders 


SYLVIA  is  known  throughout  the  world  as  the  beauty  marvel  of  Holly- 
wood. She  is  responsible  for  many  of  the  beautiful  figures  you  see 
on  the  screen.  For  the  past  five  or  six  years  she  has  been  making  the 
stars  lovely  and  she  has  received  as  high  as  $100  for  a  half -hour  s  treat- 
ment. She  is  the  masseuse  de  luxe  of  the  film  colony.  But  now  she 
devotes  her  time  to  teaching  women  and  girls  throughout  the  United 
States  how  to  do  for  themselves  what  she  has  done  for  the  actresses.  And 
hundreds  of  readers  of  Photoplay  express  delight  with  results.  Sylvia 
is  ninety-five  pounds  of  concentrated  energy,  and  the  magic  of  her  reduc- 
ing and  form-remedying  knowledge  is  imparted  to  you  each  month  on 
these  pages.     Photoplay  is  the  only  magazine  for  which  she  writes. 


back  and  walk  with  your  head  up,  you  won't 
get  the  lump.  But  take  the  exercise,  any- 
how.    It's  good  for  you. 

Now  for  a  diet  for  you  girls  with  good 
figures  or  for  you  who  have  gotten  your 
figures  to  what  they  should  be.  You  thought 
I  was  going  to  let  you  off  a  diet,  didn't  you? 
Well,  I'm  not,  for  the  reason  that  women 
lose  their  figures  when  they  eat  incorrectly. 
So  here  is  a  balanced  menu — a  health-build- 
ing, figure-preserving  diet. 

BREAKFAST 


Half  grapefruit  or  orange  juice 
Two  slices  crisp  whole  wheat  toast,  but- 
tered lightly 

Cup  of  black  coffee 

LUNCHEON 

Salad  of  lettuce,  two  heaping  tablespoons 

of  cottage  cheese 
One   slice   thinly    buttered    whole   wheat 

toast 
Dish  of  fresh  fruit  in  season 
(And  that's  plenty.     You  can  vary  the 

salad.) 

DINNER 

Tomato  juice  cocktail 

Four  ounces  of  roasted  or  broiled  meat 

Six  heaping  tablespoons  of  vegetables  (tur- 
nips, string  beans,  lima  beans,  peas, 
carrots  or  12  stalks  asparagus) 

Skin  of  baked  potato,  with  about  half  inch 
of  the  potato  left  on  the  side  and  the 
center  scooped  out 

Dish  of  fruit  gelatine 

Demi-tasse  or  glass  of  skimmed  milk 

I  WONDER  if  I  can  make  you  understand 
the  value  of  that  sensible,  balanced  diet. 
It  is  designed  to  keep  you  healthy  and  you 
simply  cannot  be  lovely  unless  you  are  well! 
Lots  of  mothers  have  written  me  asking  if 
their  young  daughters  could  safely  follow  my 
diets.  They  can  certainly  follow  that  one  and 
it  will  do  them  lots  of  good.  I  know  that 
often  girls  between  sixteen  and  eighteen  have- 
surplus  fat  which  they  will  just  naturally 
slough  off,  but  that's  no  reason  why  they 
shouldn't  have  nice  figures  right  now.  My 
exercises  and     [  please  turn  to  page  120  ] 


Reduce  Your  Stomach  This  Way 


Sylvia  says,  "One  of  the  first  signs  of  losing  your  figure  is  a  big  stomach.  But  this 
is  the  sure  way  of  making  your  abdomen  perfectly  flat.  Get  a  member  of  your  family 
or  some  friend  to  do  what  I'm  doing  to  this  girl.  I  raise  her  legs  high  in  the  air  and 
then  lower  them  to  the  floor.  While  I'm  doing  this  the  girl  is  stretching  the  stomach 
and  arm  muscles  and  keeping  her  figure.   This  should  be  done  twenty  times  a  day"

FOR  perfect  harmony

the  forehead  and  end 
well  down  on  the  chest," 
advises  Frances  Dee. 
"Never  forget  the  back 
of  your  neck,  and  press 
on  the  powder  over  a 
cream    or    lotion    base."

'^  and  her  hair  brush 
are  on  the  friendliest  of 
terms.  For  a  flat,  smooth 
coiffure  always  brush  the 
hair  against  the  scalp,  as 
Rochelle  is  doing.  For  a 
wind-blown,  vagabond 
effect,  brush  up  and  away 
from  the  head.

over  a  cream-cleansed  face  for  an  in- 
stant beauty  treatment.  When  the  skin 
begins  to  tighten,  remove  masque  with 
water.  Use  about  once  a  month.  A 
favorite  with  Kay  Francis,  also.  At 
center,  Frances  Dee  mixes  cornmeal 
with  buttermilk  for  face,  neck  and  arms 
as  an  effective  bleach  against  tan  and 
freckles.  Keep  the  moist  masque  on 
fifteen  minutes,  then  allow  to  dry 
twenty.  Remove  with  warm  water. 
Three  masques  usually  remove  all  summer 
signs.  At  right,  Sylvia  Sidney  mashes  a 
yeast  cake  in  water  to  paste  consistency 
for  an  excellent  cleansing,  soothing 
and  refining  treatment.  Keep  on  Fif-

GLORIA  STUART  likes  those  pan- 
cake vanities  that  set  us  agog  on 
their  first  appearance.  Lilyan  Tash- 
man  says  that  her  silver  one,  designed 
by  Schiaparelli,  was  the  grandfather 
of  all.  A  boon  to  escorts,  for  none 
can  fail  to  sight  them  when  they're 
dropped.     A   grand    gift  suggestion!

Combless 
Coiffure 


HERE  is  the  coiffure 
adopted  by  Adri- 
enne  Ames  for  her 
current  role  in  Guilty 
as  Hell".  Those  curls 
are  fresh  from  the  hands 
of  the  coiffeur,  un- 
combed, merely  loos- 
ened a  trifle  with  the 
fingers.  Adrienne  is 
still  an  ardent  advo- 
cate of  the  shoulder- 
length  bob  because  of 
its  adaptability.  A 
tight  curl  will  give  it 
that  short,  chic  effect,  if 
you  wish,  or  a  looser 
arrangement  create  a 
flattering,  youthful 
frame     for    the     face. 


ADRIENNE  convinces  us  that 
k  simplicity  and  sophistication 
may  well  combine  in  a  coiffure. 
There  is  a  mere  suggestion  of 
face  curl  in  that  second  broad 
wave.  Cut  just  a  fingerful  of 
hair  to  temple  length  and  press 
in  with  your  wave  for  that 
feathery,  frivolous  touch. 


THERE  is  the  precision  of  sculpture  almost  in  those  little 
tumbled,  uncombed  curls  that  caress  the  neck  like  a 
soft  fringe.  A  charming  disguise  for  the  long,  too-slim 
neck,  also.  Preserving  them  is  somewhat  of  a  problem, 
but  with  a  good  wave  set  lotion,  innumerable  hair  pins 
and  a  sleeping  net  you're  on  the  right  way.  Adrienne  s 
eccentric,  interesting  eyebrows  accent  the  color  and 
size  of  her  eyes.       High,    thin    brows    always    do    that. 


FROM  all  angles  this  coiffure  is  both  pleasant  to  the 
observer's  eye  and  pleasing  to  its  owner's  face.  Those 
brisk  ringlets  are  attained  by  curling  each  shingled  layer 
separately,  then  combing  them  all  together.  Notice  that 
its  true  charm  lies  in  its  easy  grace  of  unconcern  and  will- 
ful waywardness.  There  must  be  no  attempt  at  precise 
order  or  design.  Either  formal  or  informal,  according 
to  your  costume,  occasion  and  make-up. 


Rag-Tag 
Bob 


CONSTANT  confu- 
* —  sion  seems  to  be 
the  keynote  of  this 
very  amusing  and  in- 
souciant bob  intro- 
duced by  Claudette 
Colbert.  The  more  dis- 
arranged, the  smarter  it 
is.  The  beginning  of 
this  bob  is  a  short 
shingle,  with  the  shear- 
ing continued  all  over 
the  head.  An  un- 
curled margin  of  hair 
is  left  about  the  face 
for  those  twisty  curls 
and  forehead  fringe. 
Then  the  hair  is  crisply 
curled  over  the  entire 
head.  As  chic  and 
original    as    Claudette! 


THE  elfin  quality  of  this  head- 
dress is  emphasized  through 
those  ear  and  temple  curls.  A 
beautiful  line  that  follows  the 
natural  neck  growth  and  reveals 
the  ear  tip  has  been  achieved. 
Perfect  for  button  earrings!  An 
ideal  coiffure  for  the  animated, 
sparkling  young  person!

YLVIA  SIDNEY  is  not  playing  hide-and-go-seek 
with  you.  Instead,  she  is  showing  you  a  miraculous 
method  of  resting  the  eyes.  With  hands  tightly  cupped 
so  that  they  do  not  touch  the  eyes  yet  exclude  every  ray 
of  light,  Sylvia  sits  in  velvety  blackness  for  five  minutes. 


COUR  steps  in  the  magic  of  eye 
'  make-up.  Above,  Ruth  Hall 
is  placing  shadow.  Usually,  this 
should  cover  the  upper  lid  only 
for  day  use.  The  space  between 
Ruth's  brow  and  eye  lacking 
sufficient  natural  shadow,  she  ap- 
plies a  brown  tone  there  for 
clearer  eye  contour.  Next,  Ruth 
draws  a  light  line  with  a  brown 
pencil  along  her  upper  lid  for  a 
little  more  depth  and  mystery. 
The  pencil  is  then  used  to  ex- 
tend those  brows,  a  telling  touch 
for  almost  all  types.  The  final 
step  is  application  of  mascara. 
And  here's  a  Hollywood  secret — 
dampen  your  brush  with  saliva  in- 
stead of  water.  After  all,  they're 
your  own  eyes  and  mouth!  A 
sugary  quality  causes  the  mascara 
to  adhere  better.  Then,  having 
beautified  her  eyes,  Ruth,  at  right, 
smiles  and    hopes    you    like  them.

"THIS  portrait  of  Karen  Morley  is  fairly 
'  pulsing  with  romance  and  glamour, 
achieved,  please  notice,  not  by  that  chin- 
chilla collar  nor  those  devastating  lashes. 
Her  new  hair  arrangement  for  "Wash- 
ington Masquerade  is  entirely  respon- 
sible. And  doesn't  it  strike  a  note  of 
memory  somewhere?  Of  course — those 
post-war  days  when  we  were  bobbed, 
banged    and    marcelled    just    like    Karen. 


DOLA  NEGRI  makes  an 
'  unusual  observation  about 
those  profound  brows  of 
hers.  That  serious,  straight 
line  is  harmonious  with  the 
fuller  face.  The  high,  arched 
brow  belongs  to  the  small, 
oval  face.  An  interesting 
experiment  for  yourself. 


A  FRONT  view  of  that 
'  *  bang  is  worth  atten- 
tion. A  dozen  ringlets  clus- 
ter irregularly  against  the 
forehead.  The  side  dips 
are  pronounced  and  those 
back  curls  do  something  regal 
for  you.  You  appear  taller, 
slimmer,     more     picturesque.

He's  No  Romeo,  BUT 


THE  only  stage,  outside 
a  picture  studio.  Jack 
Holt  was  ever  on  was 
the  stage  he  drove,  up 
in  Alaska. 

And  yet,  here  he  is,  eighteen 
years  a  movie  star  and  going 
strong. 

Though  sheiks,  he-men,  and 
the  sophisticated  highbrows 
may  come  and  go  (and  do, 
thank  heaven);  though  silent 
pictures  may  die  and  talkies  be 
born;  John  Gilbert  get  married 
and  John  Gilbert  get  unmar- 
ried; Jack  Holt  just  keeps  right 
on  going.  Ringing  the  bell  year 
after  year  after  year.  Uncon- 
cerned and  unflustered. 

It's  something  to  think 
about,  isn't  it? 

Why,  he's  been  all  our  Dads' 
favorite  since  before  the  War, 
through  the  Coolidge  pros- 
perity, prohibition,  Al  Capone, 
before  radio  and  after  talkies. 
And  what's  more — he  still  is. 

It's  a  record.  And  how,  in 
the  face  of  all  the  rapid  fade- 
outs  in  Hollywood,  does  he  do 
it? 

He  wouldn't  know  himself. 
Unless  it's  the  fact  that  Jack 
Holt  has  always  looked  on  the 
making  of  pictures  as  a  busi- 
ness. Something  to  get  up  in 
the  morning  for,  hurry  down- 
town, work  hard  at  all  day,  and 
then  come  home  and  read  the 
paper.  Or  go  swimming.  And  forget  it 
business  man  does  with  his  job. 


Jack  Holt  is  Hollywood's  favorite  he-man, 
and  did  the  home  towners  let  out  a  hearty 
laugh  when  a  visiting  New  York  actress 
asked  at  a  military  ball,  "Who  is  that  fas- 
cinating person?    He  must  be  Continental!" 


Just  as  every  average 


HE  doesn't  allow  it  to  slop  all  over  his  private  life,  or  the  front 
pages.  He  wouldn't  know  how.  It's  a  pleasant  job  to  do, 
and  waving  "  Yoo-hoo"  across  the  Brown  Derby,  or  sipping 
cocktails  at  Fluffy  Fussmore's  or  grinning  ape-fashion  at  a 
Hollywood  premiere,  has  nothing  to  do  with  that  job. 

He'd  quit,  if  it  did. 

And  there's  part  of  the  reason  for  his  long  success.  He's  so 
much  a  man. 

He  gives  the  audience  good  pictures  and  no  after- work  hooey. 
In  fact,  you  never  see  or  hear  much  about  Jack  Holt  off  the 
screen.  And  for  that  reason  he's  lasted  eighteen  years.  There's 
nothing  to  get  tired  of. 

Jack  comes  from  Virginia.  One  of  those  "first  family" 
kind.  His  father  was  a  well  known  Episcopalian  minister. 
And  while  many  a  star  would  hire 
the  Hollywood  Bowl  to  scream 
out  the  interesting  fact  that  Lord 
Justice  Holt  of  England  and  Chief 
Justice  of  the  Supreme  Court, 
John  Marshall,  were  both  direct 
ancestors,  Jack  would  squint  up 
those  brown  eyes  of  his  and  demand, 
"Aw,  who  the  heck  would  be 
interested  in  that?" 

You  see,  there's  nothingof 
Hollywood  about  him. 

After   being   graduated   from    the 
Virginia   Military  Academy,  he  de-

The  most  revealing  story 
ever  written  about  a  man 
who  has  been  a  favorite 
star  for  eighteen  years 

By  Sara  Hamilton 


cided  to  be  an  engineer  instead 
of  an  army  man  and  got  him- 
self a  job  on  the  Hudson  tubes. 
And  fell  into  the  river  the 
second  day. 

At  the  conclusion  of  the  tun- 
nel business,  fate  stepped  in 
and  sent  Jack  to  pictures.  In- 
directly, of  course. 

He  held  a  coin  in  his  hand. 
Heads,  he  went  to  Havana. 
And  rhumba-ed  through  the 
tropics.  Tails,  he  went  to 
Alaska.  And  froze  himself 
silly. 

It  was — tails. 

HE  drove  stages,  leaped 
from  ice  cake  to  ice  cake, 
like  no  Eliza  with  or  without 
bloodhounds,  fell  into  anothei 
river — slightly  colder — hunted 
for  gold,  for  food  and  for  some 
good  reason  why  he  was  there. 
He  could  find  none.  So  he 
came  down  to  Oregon  and  tried 
being  a  cow  puncher.  His 
military  training  came  in 
handy.  He  could  ride  like  a 
wild  Indian. 

The  life  appealed  to  Jack. 
It  was  big  and  rugged  and  out- 
doorish,  like  Jack  himself.  So 
he  decided  to  stay  right  there 
and  raise  apples. 

And  then  his  engineering  ex- 
perience came  in  handy.     In- 
stead of  planting  the  trees  in 
rows  as  they  always  had  been 
planted,  he  worked  out  a  system  of  planting  them  in  circles, 
getting  4,800  trees  where  only  2.400  grew  before.     A  system 
that  is  used  in  plenty  of  orchards  today. 

But  the  apple  adventure  turned  out  to  be  a  lot  of  applesauce 
after  all,  so  he  came  down  the  coast  to  San  Francisco.  And 
there  a  strange  tale  came  to  Jack's  ears.  Something  about  some 
people  making  a  movie  or  something  over  at  San  Rafael. 
Sounded  kind  of  interesting  and  adventurous,  so  Jack  took  him- 
self over  to  see. 

THE  rumor  was  correct.     They  were  making  a  movie  called 
"Salomy  Jane,"  and  what's  more  they  needed  a  man  who 
could  ride.    And  was  he  right  there?    And  could  he  ride? 

He  doubled  for  the  star,  rode  a  horse  off  a  thirty-foot  cliff  and 
into  still  another  river.  He  could  not,  it  seems,  keep  out  of  the 
wet. 

But  he  practically  leaped  into  movies  with  that  leap.  He 
came  to  Hollywood  and  in  two  years 
was  a  Famous  Players-Lasky  star. 
And  starred  in  even  thing  from  draw- 
ing room  triangles  to  Zane  Grey 
Westerns.  And  was  at  home  in 
either.    And  still  is. 

We  watched  him  on  the  set  the

Pond's  Cold  Cream  does 
more  than  cleanse.  It  has  the 
perfect  consistency.  Not 
too  heavy.  Not  so 
thin  it  dries  the  skin. 
Use  it  to  bring  life  and 
freshness  to  a  tired  skin.

Pond's  Vanishing  Cream  is 
a  godsend  to  women  whose 
skin  roughens  and  chaps. 
It  smooths  and  heals  the 
skin.  Is  not  drying.  Use  it 
before  and  after  exposure. 
One  application  gives  a

Brilliant  young  society

Mrs.  coolidge's  fresh  girlish  com- 
plexion is  as  natural  as  her  unaf- 
fected cordiality.  "Certainly  I'll 
show  you  my  complexion  care.  As 
a  matter  of  fact,  I  do  it  myself. 

"First  comes  cleansing — I  always 
use  this  Pond's  Cold  Cream,  its  rich 
oils  get  every  bit  of  grime  out  of  my 
pores.  And  Pond's  Cleansing  Tissues 
to  remove  it — they  are  softer,  more 
absorbent  than  ordinary  tissues. 

"Then  comes  stimulating.  A  brisk 
patting  like  this  with  cotton  soaked 
in  Pond's  Skin  Freshener  to  refine 
the  pores,  tone  and  bring  up  my 
natural  color. 

"Now  for  protecting — this  silky 
Pond's  Vanishing  Cream  protects 
my  skin,  holds  the  powder  and 
doesn't  dry  my  skin. 

"There — that'sall.  Simple,  isn't  it? 

"Of  course,  at  bedtime,  after  thor- 
oughly cleansing  my  skin  with  this 
rich  Cold  Cream,  I  put  on  an  extra 
bit  of  the  cream  and  leave  it  on 
overnight  to  lubricate  my  skin. 

"These  four  Pond's  preparations 
give  just  the  things  your  skin  needs 
—  Cleansing,  Lubricating,  Stimu- 
lating and  Protecting."

YOUTH  

SCREEN  STARS  have  no  fear 
of  birthdays !  A  woman  can  be 
charming  at  any  age,  they  declare, 
if  she  knows  how ! 

"I'm  over  thirty,"  says  the  fas- 
cinating Betty  Compson,  adored 
screen  star.  "And  I  don't  mind 
admitting  it  in  the  least.  No  woman 
need  fear  the  years  ahead  if  she 
knows  how  to  take  care  of  her 
appearance." 

And  Anna  Q.  Nilsson  agrees! 
"Keeping  young  isn't  a  matter  of 
birthdays,"  says  this  exquisite  star, 
whose  recent  return  from  Sweden 
caused  thousands  of  fans  to  rejoice. 
"  Stage  and  screen  stars  have  learned 
how  to  keep  their  youthful  charm." 

What  is  the  secret  the  lovely 
stars  know?   Guard  complexion 


Who  would  believe  this  lovely  star  is 
over  30!  "Actresses  must  keep  youthful 
charm,"  she  says,  "and  a  young-looking 
skin  is  absolutely  necessary.  I've  used 
Lux  Toilet  Soap  for  some  time — it  cer- 
tainly does  wonders  for  the  complexion."

On  Broadway,  as  well  as  in  Holly-

other  soap  can  rival  it.  It  has  been

Three  guesses!  But  per-

It's  Claudette  Colbe.-t,  all 
right.  We'll  say  she's  all 
right.  Tired  of  ordinary 
dramatic  roles,  Claudette 
begged  to  play  the  Em- 
press Poppaea  in  De- 
Mille's  "The  Sign  of  the 
Cross."  No  one  thought 
she  could  look  wicked  or 
seductive  enough  for  the 
famous  consort,  so  Claud- 
ette had  her  picture  taken 
thus.  P.S.  She  got  the  job 

Nero,  by  the  way,  will 
be  none  other  than 
Charles  Laughton,  the 
English  actor  who  has  re- 
fused all  offers  of  stardom 
in  favor  of  real  parts. 
And,  by  the  way,  have  you 
heard  the  latest  DeMille 
gag?  "Is  it  true  that  Cecil 
DeMille  is  remaking  'The 
Ten  Commandments'?" — 
"No.  He's  improving  on

"Though  it  costs 
only  half  as  much 
I  like  it

v_>OLGATE'S  costs  me  half  what  some 
people  pay  for  toothpaste.  And  I'm  saving 
these  quarters  because  of  something  my 
dentist  told  me.  'Judy,'  said  he,  'toothpaste 
can  clean — nothing  else.  Now  the  best  one 
I  know  of  is  Colgate's.  Those  people  have 
studied  how  to  clean  teeth  for  thirty  years. 
Not  how  to  cure— that's  my  job— but  how 
to  clean  teeth  thoroughly  and  honestly.  So 
my  advice  to  you  is  not  to  pay  out  money 
for  fancy-sounding  claims  —  because  Col- 
gate's does  all  that  any  toothpaste  can  do.' 
That  seemed  sensible  to  me.  So— frankly, 
if  Colgate's  cost  twice  as  much,  I'd  still  like 
it.  But  since  it  costs  only  a  quarter— I  like 
it  twice  as  well." 


This  seal  signifies  that  the  composition

Yes— You  can  have  a  silk  that  won't 
"pull"  at  the  seams 


This 
won't 
happen.. 


W'HY  be  doubtful  about  your 
fabric  when  you  start  to  make 
a  dress?  Why  take  infinite  pains  with 
the  pattern,  the  fittings,  the  drape  of 
the  skirt,  only  to  have  the  gown  go 
bad  at  the  seams  or  "pull  out"  at 
unexpected  places? 

Why,  in  short,  spend  good  money 
for  a  nameless  fabric  just  because  it 
is  cheap  in  price? 

Thousands  ofwomen,  disillusioned, 
are  turning  again  to  known  brands 
— responsible  goods  they  know  they 
can  trust.  Sad  experiences  with  "mir- 
acle prices"  and  "miracle  values"  have 
proved  how  impossible  it  is  to  get 
something  for  nothing. 

To  these  women,  Skinner  offers  a 
new  and  remarkable  fabric — Trouble- 


proof  Crepe.  It  sells 

at  a  moderate  price, 

yet  has  extraordinary 

wearing  quality. 

It   is  slip -proof  —  woven   of 

specially-twisted  threads  of  fine  silk 

—  four  times  as  strong  as   ordinary 

crepes  at  the  seams. 

It  is  pure-dye  and  pre-shrunk. 
Washes  beautifully.  It  is  soft  and 
beautiful  in  texture. 

If  your  favorite  store  does  not  carry 
TroiMeproof  Crepe,  write  us  direct.  We 
want  every  woman  in  America  to 
have  the  opportunity  to  secure  this 
wonderful  dress  fabric.

D  FROM  I'AGE  39  ] 


The  most  married  couple  in  the  world — Walter  Pahlman  and  his 
Tahitian  bride,  Simone  Terai.  Pahlman,  who  is  Doug  Fairbanks' 
chief  technician,  met  Simone  in  San  Francisco  where  she  had  been 
sent  from  her  home  in  Papeete  for  an  education.  Married  there 
first,  they  were  re-married  in  Hollywood  by  a  priest.  Then  they  went 
to  Tahiti  with  Doug  to  film  "Mr.  Robinson  Crusoe"  and,  since  neither 
of  these  marriages  was  recognized  by  Simone's  tribe,  another  cere- 
mony, including  three  days  of  feasting  and  dancing,   was  performed 


TTHE  Hollywood  jump-off  of  "Strange  Inter- 
hide"  was  one  of  the  big  moments  of  this 
or  any  other  year. 

Hardened  to  eternal  "permeers"  though  it 
is,  the  film  town  turned  loose  a  few  new  tricks 
for  the  big  Metro  picture  of  tortured  loves. 

Four  women  fainted  in  the  sidewalk  mob 
and  had  to  be  carried  away  feet  first.  One 
small  boy  was  run  over.  Store  windows  were 
kicked  in,  clothes  were  torn  and  a  general 
melee  was  had  by  all. 

Norma  Shearer,  Clark  Gable  and  the  missus, 
and  other  film  lights,  escaped  with  their  lives. 

'-pHE  sympathy  of  all  Hollywood — 
■*■  and  the  thousands  of  his  fan 
friends — has  gone  out  to  Bill  Haines 
in  the  loss  of  his  dearly  beloved 
mother.  She  died  recently  at  their 
Hollywood  home,  at  the  early  age  of 
fifty-four. 

The  bond  between  this  mother 
and  this  son  was  particularly  strong, 
and  Bill  is  desolate. 

A  MARY  PICKFORD  story  has  just  come 
"•to   light,   and    is   titivating   the   girls   who 
gather  round  the  old  parchisi  board. 

It  seems  that  while  last  in  New  York  Little 
Man-  went  to  an  exceptionally  high-hat  party. 

84 


A  maid,  passing  south  of  the  star  at  table, 
spilled  a  cup  of  hot  chocolate  down  Pickford's 
neck,  and  was  ossified  with  fear. 

The  host  went  purple,  but  Mary  just  said 
"never  mind"  and  the  host  didn't,  though  the 
fluid  ruined  a  very  fine  white  evening  gown. 
The  hostess,  who  hadn't  seen  the  mishap,  was 
honored  by  never  having  the  star  turn  her 
back  on  her  the  whole  evening. 

And  did  the  maid  get  the  merry  old  bounce? 
Next  morning  came  an  autographed  picture 
from  Mary,  inscribed  "Think  nothing  of  it." 
A  nice  display  of  all-around  tact  and  gracious- 
ness. 

A  L  JOLSON  was  leaving  a  Holly- 
•**-wood  theater  after  a  benefit  per- 
formance, when  the  usual  crowd  sur- 
rounded him. 

"What  were  they  after,  Al,"  a  friend 
asked,  "autographs?" 

"And  touches!"  Al  replied.  "Why, 
these  days  you  can't  even  play  a 
benefit  and  break  even." 

17". \Y  Francis  and  Ken  MacKcnna  didn't 
get  to  Europe  on  that  honeymoon,  after  all. 
They  reached  New  York — and  then  Kay  was 
called  back  to  work  on  the  new  Lubitsch 
picture. 


But  the  happy  couple  did  accomplish  some- 
thing. They  saw,  for  the  first  time  together, 
a  little  old  New  England  homestead  that  Ken 
bought  six  years  ago — and  never  saw  the  in- 
side of! 

It  was  just  what  he  wanted,  and  he  bought 
it  without  in-pectinx  the  innards  of  the  house. 
He  furnished  it  with  rare  antiques,  planning 
the   rooms   from    blue-prints. 

Somehow,  he  never  managed  to  get  around 
to  his  New  England  home,  though  his  mother 
and  father  have  been  using  it  as  a  summer 
home  lately. 

This  year,  for  the  first  time,  Ken  was  able 
to  visit  and  enjoy  his  own  little  farmhouse. 
And  to  it  he  brought  his  beauteous  bride. 
Nice  little  story  about  nice  people. 

"Y'OU  think  you've  seen  a  lot  of  Marlene 
Dietrich?  Pshaw,  friends,  you  practically 
haven't  beheld  anything  so  far. 

La  Belle  Marlene  wears  a  costume  in  "The 
Blonde  Venus"  that  is  guaranteed  to  make  a 
blind  man  yell  "Uncle!" 

It  consists,  solely,  of  a  sheath  of  gold  cloth 
that  has  a  very  high  neck,  but  downstairs  is 
cut — well,  a  bit  above  the  bathing  suit  line, 
to  put  it  mildly. 

All  this,  I  suppose,  because  her  under- 
pinnings supreme  were  not  unveiled  once  in 
"Shanghai  Express!" 

One  hot  noon  she  wore  the  costume  right  into 
the  Paramount  lunch  room,  and  was  there  a 
sensation!  Fifty  strong,  sun-burned  men 
fainted  dead  away!

Mis  eyes  don't  stray  to  other  faces 
since  I  took  my  beauty  experts  advice 


She  said:  "Start  tonight!  Apply  this  beauty  treatment 
to  your  skin.  Use  this  soap  rich  in  olive  oil.  See  how 
yielding  softness— youthful  firmness  returns  to  the  skin." 


WARNING— to  careless  youth— to 
discouraged  age — to  women  of  all 
ages  who  know . .  .  but  too  often  forget, 
the  lure  of  a  soft,  seductive  skin. 

Don't  ignore  it!  Never  forget  it!  Re- 
member—  there  is  a  simple,  easy  way  to 
guard  the  inviting  skin  of  youth  ...  to 
win  back  the  charm  that  you  may  think 
you  are  losing  as  you  grow  older. 

Olive  oil  in  soap  is  the  answer.  Doc- 
tors advise  it  from  the  time  of  baby's  first 
bath — even  an  olive  oil  rub  before  baby's 
first  bath.  Beauty  experts  are  unanimous 
in  advising  it  to  their  patrons.  In  fact, 
nothing  compares  with  the  softening, 
soothing,  firming  effect  of  olive  oil. 

But  how  to  use  olive  oil.  The  answer  is 
Palmolive  Soap.  For  Palmolive  chemists 
know  the  exact  proportion  of  olive  oil 
needed  to  produce  a  genuine  cosmetic 
effect  in  soap. 

Remember — beauty  claims  don't  make 
a  beauty  soap.  A  real  beauty  soap  must 
have  a  known  beauty  ingredient. 
Palmolive's  beauty  claim  is  based  on  olive 
oil.  Don't  expect  beauty  results  from  a 
soap  that  does  not  contain  Palmolive's 
generous  olive  oil  content. 

Watch  — expectantly,  confidently  for  vis- 
ible results  from  Palmolive.  Notice  how 
satiny  smooth  and  clear  skin  becomes 
after  regular  use  of  Palmolive  Soap. 


"Don't  try  this,  that  and  the 
other  thing.  Olive  and  palm 
are  the  finest  of  cosmetic  oils. 
Palmolive  combines  them  for 
you  in  an  excellent  skin  cleanser. 
I  endorse  its  use  after  prolonged 
experiment  in  my  salon. "

guished beauty  expert.

J[GGS   is  dead.     That   famous   talking  bull 
dog  of   the   movies.      Known   and    loved   by 
thousands  of  stars  who  mourn  his  death. 

Hack  in  the  old  "Leather  Pusher"  series  at 
Universal,  Jiggs  began  barking  his  way  to 
fame.  With  such  stars  as  Chevalier  in  "The 
Love  Parade,"  with  Buddy  Rogers  in  "Wings," 

86 


the  kids  in  "Skippy"  and  the  dog  comedies 
of  M-G-M,  Jiggs  always  gave  an  outstanding 
performance.  And  now,  at  eleven  years  of 
age,  he's  dead.  And  friends  gathered  to 
mourn  for  Jiggs.  He  was  buried  in  the  tiny 
redwood  casket  made  especially  for  him,  and 
beside  him  rested  his  youngest  puppy  who 
died  the  same  day  as  his  father.

"TAON'T  tell  a  certain  Hollywood  director 
■*-^that  the  Si  Perkinses  of  the  Crossroads 
aren't  as  modern  as  the  next  one.  The  tale 
goes  that  this  director  sent  a  scout  out  in  the 
back  country  to  find  a  suitable  location,  one 
of  the  requirements  being  a  place  for  thirty 
extra  men  and  thirty  extra  girls  to  dress. 

An  ideal  spot  was  found  and  the  farmer 
promised  the  necessary  accommodations.  A 
week  later  the  troupe  arrived  to  find  just  one 
large  room  built.  The  director  stormed.  "I've 
j;ot  thirty  men  and  thirty  women,"  he  said, 
"They  can't  all  dress  in  here.  " 

"Why,"  the  farmer  asked  in  surprise,  "what's 
the  matter?    Ain't  they  speakin'?" 

'  I  'HE  name  of  Gary  Cooper's  chimpanzee  has 
certainly  caused  a  riot  of  discussion!    Half 
of  Hollywood   claims   it's  Tallulah  and   the 
other  half  bets  on  Toluca. 

Here's  the  low-down,  as  reported  to  us.

Absolutely  new 

most  radical  advance  in  sanitary  protection 
since  the  invention  of  Kotex  itself  in  1920 


the  new 

Phantom 
Kotex 


SANITARY  NAPKIN 

(U.   S.   Par.   No.   1,857,854) 

Leaves  no  trace  of  reveal- 
ing outline  —  even  under 
closest-fitting  frocks. 

FROM  THE  makers  of  Kotex  comes  this 
announcement  of  supreme  importance  to 
women.  Announcement  of  an  utterly  new 
design  in  sanitary  protection. 

The  new  PHANTOM*  KOTEX — called 
Phantom  because  you  are  scarcely  aware  of 
its  presence  —  is  so  skilfully  shaped  and 
tapered  that  you  wear  it  under  closest-fitting 
gowns  without  slightest  hint  of  revealing 
outline. 

Do  not  be  confused.  Other  sanitary  pads 
calling  themselves  form-fitting;  other  styles 
with  so-called  tapered  ends,  are  in  no  sense 
the  same  as  the  new  PHANTOM  KOTEX, 
U.  S.  Patent  No.  1,857,854. 

Other  Kotex  features  retained 

It  is — as  you  will  see — amazingly  soft — 
delicate — five  times  more  absorbent  than 
cotton;  can  be  worn  on  either  side  with  the 
same  protection.  Easy  disposability  is  still 
a  superior  Kotex  advantage. 

Another  thing:  You  get  this  vastly  im- 
proved product  at  no  increase  in  cost.  So 
important  is  it  for  you  to  get  the  new 
PHANTOM  KOTEX  that  we  have  stamped 
the  name  Kotex  on  both  ends  of  the  new 
pad.  All  dealers  have  it.  Also  in  vending 
cabinets  through  West  Disinfecting  Co. 

Note!  Kotex— now  at  your  dealer's — marked 
"Form-Fitting"  is  the  new  Phantom*  Kotex. 


1  o  ease 

the  task  of 

enlightenment 

This  message  is  sent  to 
parents  and  guardians 
in  a  spirit  of  con- 
structive helpfulness. 


THIS  year — some  five 
million  young  girls  be- 
tween the  ages  of  10  and  14 
will  face  one  of  the  most  try- 
ing situations  in  all  the  year-, 
of  young  womanhood. 

This  year — some  five  mil- 
lion mothers  will  face  the 
most  difficult  task  of  mother- 
hood. 

Thousands  of  these  moth- 
ers will  sit  down  in  quiet 
rooms  —  and  from  that  in- 
timacy so  characteristic  of 
today's  mother  and  daughter 
— there  will  result  that  un- 
derstanding so  vital  to  the 
daughter  of  today— the  wife 
and  mother  of  tomorrow. 

There  will  be  other  thou- 
sands of  mothers  —  coura- 
geous— intimate  in  all  things 
but  this.  There  will  be  thou- 
sands too  timid  to  meet  this 
problem — and  it  will  pass — 
but  with  what  possible  un- 
happiness  .  .  .  what  heart- 
breaking experience. 

To  free  this  task  of  en- 
lightenment from  the  slight- 
est embarrassment — the 
Kotex  Company  has  had 
prepared  an  intimate  little 
chat  between  mother  and 
daughter.lt  is  called  "Mar- 
jorie  May's  Twelfth  Birth- 
day. ' ' 

In  this  story  booklet — the 
subject  has  been  covered

that  he  did  like  acting  better  than  school 
leaching. 

Then  he  fell  in  love  with  Helen  Clarke 
Robertson,  leading  lady  and  daughter  of 
wealthy,  socially  prominent  attorney  Francis 
Robertson  of  New  York  City. 

The  young  folks  eloped  and  started  for 
Hollywood  in  an  old  car. 

Private  detectives  and  police  searched  the 
country  for  them. 

They  landed  at  Ann  Harding's  hill  top 
house,  a  dirty,  worn  couple,  late  one  evening. 
"Here  we  are.  We've  come  to  go  into  pictures. 
You  told  me  to  come,"  John  added. 

Ann  took  them  in  and  telephoned  their 
people. 

And  the  next  day  she  talked  to  them.  She 
told  them  Hollywood  was  no  place  for  people 
who  wanted  happiness. 

She  pictured  its  pitfalls,  its  jealousies,  its 
artificialities. 

"Go  home  and  live  life  as  it  was  intended. 
Forget  what  I  told  you  a  year  ago — " 

And  the  youngsters  went  home  to  snatch 
at  happiness  according  to  the  recipe  of  the 
Hollywood-disillusioned  Ann  Harding  of  to- 
day rather  than  by  the  one  of  the  optimistic 
Ann  Harding  of  a  year  ago.

A  is  honeymooning.  At  Prescott,  Ariz.,  not 
long  ago,  the  beauteous  Todd  said  "I  do"  to 
one  Pasquale  de  Cicco,  aged  twenty-three,  of 
New  York  City.  Heigho,  Thelma!  Lucky 
boy,  Pasquale,  old  boy!

Hollywood's  most  exciting  wed- 
ding of  the  month  was  that  of  plat- 
inum Jean  Harlow  and  executive 
Paul  Bern,  for  just  when  the  town 
had  it  all  doped  out  that  Paul 
would  continue  being  an  eligible 
bachelor  for  the  rest  of  his  life  and 
that  nothing  could  tempt  Jean  to 
the  altar  a  second  time — the  mar- 
riage ceremony  was  read.  Con- 
gratulations, Paul!  And  worlds 
of  happiness  for  you,  Jeanie! 


T  THINK   the  following  little  true  story  of 

Ann  Harding  illustrates  her  change  in  heart 
and  attitude  toward  life  and  Hollywood  more 
than  the  numerous  articles  of  thousands  of 
words. 

A  little  more  than  a  year  ago,  while  she  was 
still  happily  married  and  living  in  her  world 
of  unmarred  ideals,  she  visited  in  the  home  of 
Janus  Frazier,  sculptor,  in  Connecticut.  She 
met  Frazier's  nephew,  John  Schrayer. 

"You  look  exactly  like  Joel  McCrea."  she 
told  John.  "You  should  be  in  pictures. 
You'd  better  come  back  to  Hollywood  with 
us." 

John  shook  his  head.  "Don't  be  silly.  I'm 
teaching  school  and  like  it.  Why  should  I 
give  up  something  sure  which  I  like  for  pic- 
ture- 

"Well,  if  you  ever  change  your  mind,  look 
me  up,"  Ann  answered. 

Three  months  later,  Lawrence  Langner 
Started  his  theater  guild  in  Westport  and  John 
Schrayer  became  leading  man.    He  discovered

good  with  any  dress,  pale  or  vivid. 
Charming  with  pastel  pink,  blue,

Coral  is  enchanting  with  white,  pale

AFTER  all,  the  smart  Sportswoman 
j^Y.  is  a  Woman  .  .  .  just  as  feminine 
these  days  as  anybody  else.  And  all  the 
time  she's  collecting  large  silver  cups,  she's 
thoroughly  aware  of  the  importance  of 
powder,  rouge,  lipstick  and  Variety  in 
Nail  Tints. 

She  varies  her  nail  polish  with  her 
sports  clothes  the  same  as  she  does  with 
her  evening  clothes,  because  she  doesn't 
see  why  she  should  look  any  less  smart 
by  day  than  by  night. 

And  the  opportunity  for  alluring  com- 
binations of  nail  tints  with  this  summer's 
sports  clothes  is  nothing  short  of  exciting. 

V/oral  nails  with  your  white  tennis 
dresses  and  little  beige  golf  sweaters  will

Some    Dos   And    Don't's    For   Beauty 


By 

Carolyn 

Van 

Wyck 


IF  your  eyes  are 
without  na  t  u  ra  I 
shadow  or  your  lashes 
light,  apply  shadow 
on  the  tip  of  a  nar- 
row camel  s  hair 
brush,"  advises  Fifi 
Dorsay.  "Work  lightly 
and  blend  to  attain 
a  life-like,  subtle 
nuance  in  eye  and 
shadow    tones." 


WELL,  here  we  are  at  the  end 
of  the  season  of  revelation — 
the  season  of  the  bathing  suit, 
the  tennis  frock  and  the  sheer  chiffon. 
Trying  days  for  some  of  us,  big  moments 
for  others.  Summer  sets  the  stage  for 
the  girl  with  a  good  figure.  Wimer 
robs  her  of  some  of  her  chances.  All  of  which 
brings  us  to  that  debatable  question,  what  is 
a  good  figure  ?  What  are  Hollywood  standards 
for  a  good  figure  ?  At  the  moment,  broad  shoul- 
ders sway  power  over  those  of  less  breadth, 
hips  are  small  though  rounded,  busts  are  the 
same,  and  the  legs  and  arms  are  gentry  rounded, 
easily  curved.  In  short,  here  is  the  figure 
that  can  wear  clothes  to  perfection,  the  body 
that  can  walk  with  a  lilt,  that  can  dance  with 
music  in  its  every  movement.  That  is,  it 
should  be  able  to.  Those  broad  shoulders 
give  the  upper  part  of  your  body  a  stationery 
position.  Arms  should  move  but  slightly 
when  you  walk,  never  when  you  dance.  Thus, 
you  see,  all  freedom  comes  from  the  hips 
down.  They  must  swing  from  the  waist  in- 
dependent of  motion  above  it.  If  you 
want  to  develop  an  easy,  graceful  walk,  try 
walking  with  all  motion  from  the  waist  down. 
It  is  surprisingly  easy  and  you  will  never  tire 
as  you  do  from  walking  with  your  whole  body. 
Another  gross  error  to  which  we  are  all 
heir — do  not  walk  with  your  toes  turned  out- 
ward. We  were  taught  that,  I  know,  but  try 
keeping  them  straight  ahead,  not  outward 
or  inward.  You  balance  yourself  thus  and 
walking  is  easier,  lighter,  a  more  graceful 
movement.

A  NITA  LOUISE

perfume  your  belongings  most  divinely. 
When  Sylvia  was  in  Xew  York 
recently  she  showed  me  a  drawerful  of 
dead  gardenias,  a  bit  macabre.  I  admit, 
but  I  had  only  to  sniff  the  silk  and 
chiffon  beneath  to  realize  that  no  Paris 
perfumer  could  do  better  than  those 
wilted  and  browned  gardenias. 

JOAN  CRAW  FORD,  passing  through  Xew 
-'  York  en  route  to  Europe,  contributes  two 
newsy  bits  to  this  column. 

Joan,  you  know,  has  always  used  very  dark 
and  vivid  nail  polish,  a  predominant  Holly- 
wood habit,  by  the  way.  Joan  now  continues 
this  deep  red  over  the  entire  length  of  the  nail. 
No  platinum  or  snow-white  edge  graces  her 
nail.  This  is  just  one  of  those  things  with 
Joan  whose  nails  are  naturally  quite  long  and 
well  shaped.  The  short,  plump  hand,  how- 
ever, will  find  that  this  use  adds  decidedly  to 
the  illusion  of  length  and  is  very  becoming. 

Jean  Harlow  is  using  platinum  nail  polish 
to  match  her  platinum  hair,  while  another 
element  of  Hollywood  goes  in  for  polka  dotted 
and  striped  nails.  When  are  we  coming  to 
little  pictures  and  designs  ! 

IX  the  picture  above  you  will  notice  Joan's 
hair  comb  for  "Rain."  Joan  rearranges  this 
in  a  charming  coiffure  which  may  suggest  just 
the  arrangement  for  your  own  hair.  You  need 
a  long  bob  for  this.  The  hair,  including  bangs, 
is  combed  straight  back  from  the  forehead. 
There  it  is  held  with  invisible  holders,  ovel 
which  Joan  slips  jeweled  clips.  The  ends  are 
then  rolled  into  curls.  The  bangs  are  now 
combed  forward,  the  ends  twirled  gently 
under.  By  first  combing  these  bangs  back  and 
then  bringing  them  forward,  they  have  a  kind 
of  buoyancy,  so  that  they  do  not  hug  the  fore- 
head too  closely.    A  good  stunt  for  all  bangs.

The  old  Answer  Man  will  make  a  wager  that  if  Bette  Davis  knew  just  how 

many  folks  called  her  "my  favorite  actress"  in  their  letters  this  month,  she 

would  be  too  excited  to  finish  reading  that  book

BETTE  DAVIS  has  been  in  the  movies  for 
almost  a  year,  but  you  folks  have  just  dis- 
covered her,  apparently.  Bette  walked 
away  with  this  month's  mail  bag,  and  when  you 
get  through  asking,  the  poor  girl  won't  have  a 
secret  left.  She  started  her  film  career  in  De- 
cember, 1931,  but  the  studio  boys  thought  she 
was  one  of  those  meek  sisters  who  could  be 
conveniently  shoved  into  nice  mild  parts  and  no 
harm  done.  You  know  the  type,  younger  sisters 
without  much  acting  to  do,  and  roles  like  that. 

But  what  they  didn't  know  was  that  Bette 
is  a  poised,  self-sufficient  young  woman.  ''The 
Man  Who  Played  God,"  with  George  Arliss, 
"  The  Dark  Horse, "  and  "The  Rich  Are  Always 
With  Us,"  in  which  she  was  up  against  that 
tough  Chatterton  competition,  gave  her  a  host 
of  fans  and  question-askers. 

First  of  all,  she  is  younger  than  all  that  so- 
phistication she  tosses  off  on  the  screen  would 
lead  you  to  believe,  for  she  was  born  April  5, 
1908,  which,  if  my  arithmetic  doesn't  fail  me 
at  this  vital  moment,  makes  her  just  24.  Her 
very  correct  Boston  family  christened  her  Ruth 
Elizabeth,  but  when  she  went  to  school  she 
wanted  to  be  called  "Betty.''  However,  her 
spelling  wasn't  so  good,  so  when  she  signed  her 
report  card— or  whatever  children  sign  at 
school — she  wrote  "Bette."  Her  mother 
thought  it  was  cute  and  let  it  go.  But  it's  still 
pronounced  "Hetty." 

Although  no  one  in  the  family  had  ever  been 
on  the  stage.  Bette  was  hittm  by  the  theatri- 
calitus  bug  and  she  and  her  mother  went  to 
New  York.  There  wasn't  much  money,  but 
mama  Davis  persuaded  John  Murray  Ander- 
son to  give  her  daughter  instruction. 

While  she  was  playing  on  the  stage  with 
Richard  Bennett  in  "Solid  South."  he  told 
her  she  was  a  combination  of  his  two  daugh- 
ters, Constance  and  Joan,  and  maybe  that's 
what  put  the  idea  of  pictures  into  her  head. 
You  will  admit  that  she  does  seem  to  combine 
Connie's  sophistication  with  Joan's  sweetness, 
and  yet  remain  a  distinct  personality. 

Bette  was  bom  in  Lowell,  Mass.  She's  5  feet, 
3]  _■;  weighs  1 10  pounds,  lias  blue  eyes,  blonde 
hair  and  those  dark  eyebrows  are  natural. 

She  isn't  married,  but  sin-  admits  that  she 
has  been  in  love  oil  and  on — mostly  on. 


'i  ' 


Anna  Boothf.  ,  Detroit,  Mtch. — Yes, 
ma'am,  that  item  you  read  in  the  paper  which 
stated  that  Garbo  and  Joan  Crawford  wore  the 
same  size  shoe  was  all  wrong.  So  let's  settle  it 
once  and  for  good.  Garbo  takes  a  7-AA  slipper, 
whereas  Joan's  trim  little  foot  fits  perfectly 
into  a  4-D.  I  sometimes  wonder  myself  where 
these  strange  stories  start.  Probably  lots  of 
girls  in  Hollywood  wear  shoes  as  large  as 
Garbo's,  but  certainly  not  Joan,  who  has  an 
unusually  small  foot  for  her  height,  which  is 
5  feet,  4  inches.  So  now  that  burning  discus- 
sion is  all  finished. 

Earl  Hughes,  Jamaica,  Long  Island. — 
Hope  this  information  breaks  up  the  tong  war 
that  you  and  your  pals  are  having.  It  was 
Halliwell  Hobbes  who  played  the  role  of  Rose 
Hobart's  father  in  "  Dr.  Jekyll  and  Mr.  Hyde. " 

T.  M.  K.,  Montreal,  Canada. — Yes,  of 
course,  Norma  Shearer  and  Irving  Thalberg 
are  still  happily  married.  Irving  Junior  was 
two  years  old  on  the  24th  of  August.  And  does 
he  boss  the  lot  where  his  mama  and  papa  work! 

D.  J.  Oliver,  Roswell,  Ga. — So  you  folks 
way  down  theah  in  Gaw'ja  are  interested  in 
that  little  Southern  honey,  Una  Merkel.  She 
was  born  in  Covington,  Ky.,  suh,  and  proud 
of  it. 

Yes,  Marie  Dressier  has  been  married.  She 
is  the  widow-  of  James  H.  Dalton  and  every- 
thing you  want  to  know  about  Marie  you'll  End 
in  that  grand  story  by  Adela  Rogers  St.  Johns 
on  another  page  of  this  magazine.  Isn't  she 
a  great  woman — that  Marie?  You'll  think  her 
even  greater  when  you've  read  the  Story. 

Sylvia  Sidney  was  born  in  Xew  York  City. 

And  now  for  your  last  question.  That  little 
bunch  of  cuteness  who  plays  in  "Our  Gang" 
comedies  and  is  known  as  "Spanky"  was  born 
with  this  monniker — George  Robert  Phillips 
McFarland. 

And  isn't  that  a  mouthful?  We'll  just  keep 
on  calling  him  "Spanky"  for  short. 

John  Bowlinc,  Butte,  Mont.  —  Hi, 
Mickey!  So  you're  interested  in  the  Mickey 
Mouse  Club,  are  you?    The  way  to  join  is  to 


go  to  the  theater  manager  of  one  of  your  local 
theaters  and  ask  him  if  he  has  a  Mickey  Mouse 
Club,  for  each  manager  handles  an  individual 
club,  although  all  are  under  the  exclusive 
leadership  of  that  bright  little  lad  Mickey  and 
his  equally  bright  sweetheart,  Minnie.  You'd 
better  join;  you'll  have  great  fun. 

Lorena  Kundert,  Dayton,  Ohio. — Xo. 
you're  not  unusual,  Lorena,  wanting  to  know 
something  about  Kane  Richmond,  the  lad  who 
played  the  role  of  Tom  Stone  in  "Huddle." 
That  boy  made  a  big  hit  in  a  small  part  and 
lots  of  folks  have  been  asking  questions  about 
him.  He  won't  be  26  until  December  23.  And 
he  isn't  married. 

Joan  Crawford  and  Douglas  Fairbanks.  Jr., 
were  married  June  3,  1929.  Right  now  Doug 
is  realizing  an  ambition  of  long  standing — he 
is  "doing"  Europe  with  Joan.  It's  her  first 
trip.  Before  they  left,  Doug  had  a  list  of  points 
of  interest  as  long  as  a  Marlene  Dietrich  close- 
up.    And  Joan's  got  to  see  them  all. 

Becky,  Dayton,  Ohio. — Connie  Bennett's 
latest  is  "Two  Against  the  World."  If  you 
like  Connie,  don't  miss  her  in  "What  Price 
Hollywood.  "  What  a  performance  Madame  la 
Marquise  gives  in  that  one! 

Madge  Evans'  latest  picture  is  "The  Xew 
Yorker. "  Dorothy  Jordan  has  a  couple  of 
films  up  her  sleeve — "Down  to  Earth"  and 
"Cabin  in  the  Cotton."  Xo.  Becky.  I  don't 
believe  you'll  have  to  bid  Garbo  a  last  good- 
bye just  yet.  Of  course,  nobody  is  sure  about 
anything  about  la  Greta. 

June  Creole,  Tampa,  Fla. — There's  no 
doubt  about  Doug  Fairbanks.  Jr.'s  favorite 
sport.  It's  football,  football  and  a  little  more 
football.  He  never  misses  a  game  and  the 
Western  players  are  all  his  personal  fri 
Doug  likes  nothing  so  much  as  hanging  around 
with  the  pigskin  heroes.  And  are  those  boys 
for  him?  One  hundred  per  cent!  He  plays 
football,  too.  He  and  Doug  Sr.,  and  several  of 
the  other  actors  have  an  amateur  team  of  their 
own.  Doug  also  likes  good  looking  cars.  Yes. 
he  likes  dogs  and  cats,  too.  Xow  are  you  satis- 
tied  about  the  lad?

DRUG  STORES  QUERIED 

State   Association  Hears 
That    34.2%    Switch  j? 
Every  Third  Sale ;  Prac-  / 
tice   Greatest   in   Cities  [ 

Saratoga  Springs,  N.  Y. — Exactlv 
84.5%  of  the  591  New  York  State  'i 
druggists  answering  a  recent  question- 
naire stated  that  they  attempt  to  sell 
competitive  items  in  place  of  national- 
ly advertised  cut-price  articles.  The 
questionnaire,  which  queried  drug- 
gists on  many  pertinent  questions,  was 
sent  out  by  the  Committee  on  Phar- 
maceutical Economics  of  the  New 
York  State  Pharmaceutical  Associa- 
tion. It  was  reported  on  at  the 
Fifty-Fourth  annual  meeting  of  the 
association  held  here  last  week. 

The  summaries  of  the  answers  to  a 
second  question  asked  by  the  commit- 
tee showed  that,  of  478  stores  report- 
ing, 34.2%  were  successful  in  actually 
selling  the  competitive  item  in  place 
of  a  cut-priced  advertised  item  in 
more  than  one  out  of  every  three 
sales. 


"This  is  much  better 
than  what  you  ask  for" 


Of  course,  no  such  proportion  as 
five  out  of  every  six  druggists 
everywhere  substitute  unknown 
products  for  nationally  advertised 
articles. 

But  a  shameful  number  of  them 
do. 

You  have  a  right  to  resent  this. 
Reputable  manufacturers  spend 
money  for  advertising  only  be- 
cause they  are  assured  that  their 
products  are  good  enough  to  de- 
serve your  continuing  patronage. 


Merchants  only  try  to  substitute 
unknown  or  inferior  products  be- 
cause they  have  a  bigger  margin 
of  profit  on  them.  You  pay  more 
for  less  value. 

We  urge  Photoplay  readers  to 
buy  only  those  reputable,  worthy 
products  of  known  quality.  Don't 
permit  a  merchant  to  substitute 
unknown  and  inferior  prepara- 
t;ons,  when  your  mind  is  made  up 
to  purchase  a  product  of  known 
quality.

A  MOTHER  boneymooner  of  the  hour  is  our 
own  Sylvia,  whose  articles  on  the  care  of 
the  Ixxly  are  such  an  interesting  feature  of 
Photoplay. 

Sylvia  is  the  l>ri<le  of  Edward  Letter,  an  actor 
and  a  nephew  of  the  late  Edward  Leiter,  Chi- 
cago financier. 

They  are  living  in  New  York,  where  Sylvia 
is  writing,  talking  on  the  radio — and,  of  course, 
making  little  ones  out  of  big  ones. 

rr*HREE  guesses  on  the  latest  rave  at  Holly- 
wood's  gayest  parties?  No — you'll  never 
get  it  in  ten! 

Janet  Gaynor,  no  less — shy,  wistful  Janet. 
The  men  buzz  around  like  bees,  and  Husband 
Lydell  Peck  lurks  in  the  background,  smiling 
amiably  at  Janet's  sudden  social  tornado. 

Oh  sure,  Charlie  Farrell's  often  around  in 
the  buzz — but  Hollywood  understands  that 
fine  friendship  now. 

Incidentally  and  at  the  same  time,  it  appears 
that  Janet  is  a  little  fed  up  with  the  attentions 
of  the  press. 

"  Let  them  say  what  they  like  without  seeing 
me, "  is  the  Gaynor  dictum. 

Well,  maybe  you're  right.  Janet. 

But  that  isn't  the  way  helpful  friendships 
are  made. 

~L_TLRE'S  the  funniest  gag  of  the  month — 
but  the  little  street  urchin  who  pulled  it 
was  entirely  innocent  of  its  irony! 

When  Joan  Crawford  was  in  Xew  York  she 
and  one  of  Photoplay's  staff  were  riding  along 
Fifth  Avenue,  as  Joan  was  telling  how  mad  it 
made  her  for  folks  to  say  she  imitated  Garbo. 

"You  know  how  it  started?"  Joan  asked 
dramatically.  "I  once  said  I  admired  Garbo 
above  all  other  actresses  and  I  suppose  people 
thought  that  because  I  admired  her  I  wanted 
to  imitate  her.  Which  is  dead  wrong.  They 
say  I  do  my  hair  like  hers.  Listen,  I  wore  a 
long  bob  in  a  picture  I  made  five  years  ago. 
Lately  Adrian  made  me  a  hat  that  looks  like 
one  Garbo  wore — but  it's  simply  a  smart  hat. 
You  see  hundreds  of  them  on  the  street.  And 
then  they  say  I  try  to  imitate  Garbo.    Bunk!'' 

Just  at  that  moment  a  little  boy  jumped  on 
the  running  board  and  asked  Joan  to  buy  a 
gardenia. 

Joan  smiled  sweetly  and  gave  the  child  a  dol- 
lar telling  him  to  keep  the  change. 

"Thanks  lady, "  he  said — and  then  he  looked 
at  her  more  closely. 

"Say.  why  say,''  he  murmured  in  an  awed 
voice,  "ain't  you  Greta  Garbo?  You  look  just 
like  her. " 

And  as  the  traffic  lights  changed  and  the 
car   slid   forward  Joan   practically    swooned! 

•"THAT  ole  rebel,  George  Bancroft,  finally 
left  Paramount  for  good  and  all,  after 
years  of  intermittent  bickering  over  salary 
and  stories. 

Reliance,  an  independent  outfit,  is  the  name 
of  the  company  which  now  proposes  to  exploit 
Big  Ban's  talents,  torso  and  biceps.  "Brook- 
lyn Bridge"  may  be  the  title  of  what  may  be 
his  first  story. 

Drolly  enough,  George's  last  Paramount 
picture,  "Lady  and  Gent."  is  the  best  he's 
had  in  the  last  couple  of  years — which  shows 
how  quaintly   Fate   operates. 


pi<O.M   Claude  Binyon's  "A  Girl  Ought  to 
Work,"  a  story  of  one  girl's  fun  in  Holly- 
wood, published  by  Harrison  Smith: 

"After  the  premeer  Henry  Henry  inter- 
duced  me  to  Mr.  Bowstein  the  director  and  he 
said,  Charming  girl  Henry,  charming  girl. 
She's  just  the  type  for  the  street  walker  in 
Hot  Hearts.  And  Henry  Henry  said.  She  sure 
is  Mr  Bowstein,  she  sure  is  that,  yes  sir. 
Then  I  said.  I  been  a  street  walker  li  I 
times,  and  everybody  laughed.  I  said,  The 
last  time  I  was  a  street  walker  was  for  Mr. 
O'Malky  at  Pathe. 

And  Mr.  Bowstein  said,  It's  a  pity  that  guy 
can't  live  on  his  own  salary,  and  everybody 
laughed  again." 

T/"  NOW  when  and  where  that  classic  remark 
of  Garbo's  "I  tank  I  go  home,"  originated? 

It  was  during  the  making  of  her  first  Ameri- 
can film,  "The  Torrent." 

Garbo  was  compelled  to  plunge  into  an  icy 
pool  of  water. 

She  emerged  shivering  and  cold. 

"Fine''  the  director  said,  "now  let's  do  it 
again."  Once  more  Garbo  plunged  into  the 
icy  pool  and  this  time  emerged  shivery  and 
shaking. 

"That's  great. "  the  director  said.  "  now  let's 
do  it  again." 

Garbo  walked  around  the  studio  made  pool 
of  water  and  gazed  into  its  clear,  cold  depths. 

Then  picking  up  her  cloak  from  a  chair,  she 
strolled  away  calmly  remarking  to  the  director, 
"  I  tank  I  go  home. "' 

And  history,  brothers  and  sisters,  was  made! 

O  ALLY  EILERS  and  Hoot  Gibson 
^have  just  celebrated  their  second 
wedding  anniversary  —  and  you 
should  see  the  diamond  brooch  Hoot 
gave! 

It's  enormous,  in  two  parts,  with 
a  clasp  that  either  binds  or  looses 
the  parts.  Separate,  they  can  be  used 
as  hat  clasps  or  what  would  you? 
Some  jools! 

"T^NID  you  hear  how  Ben  Lyon  capped  the 
■^climax  at  Bebe  Daniels'  famous  tennis 
tournament? 

Thinking  he  could  add  a  little  splurge  to  the 
party,  he  presented  the  winners  with  cups  he 
had  won  at  the  dog  races. 

The  girls  were  thrilled  to  death  until  one 
noticed  the  inscription  on  a  cup,  "For  the  Best 
Female  Whippet  in  her  Class." 

And  at  sundown  they  were  still  chasing  Ben 
along  the  sandy  shore! 

T—TOLLYWOOD  is  a  pretty  blase  town,  if 
you  ask  me.  World-famous  celebrities 
arrive  in  droves  and  rate  no  more  than  a 
passing  nod. 

Hollywood  is  too  used  to  fame  to  do  nip-ups 
over  anyone.  But  recently  there  happened 
the  exception. 

It  was  in  the  Paramount  dining-room,  crowd- 
ed, as  usual,  with  famous  people.  Chevalier  sat 
at  his  table.  George  M.  Cohan.  Xew  York 
actor,  writer  and  producer,  sat  at  another. 
Dietrich  smiled  languidly  across  the  way. 
Bing  Crosby  fussed  with  his  salad.  The  Marx 
Brothers  were  deep  in  a  ridiculous  discussion.

Bankhead's  husky  voice  could  be  heard  above 
the  din. 

And  suddenly  it  happened.  The  door  opened 
and  she  breezed  in,  like  a  young  stenographer 
with  twenty  minutes  for  lunch.  Her  towseled 
hair  flying. 

For  an  instant  there  was  a  deep  silence.  And 
then  with  one  accord  those  famous  celebrities 
burst  into  an  applause  that  was  deafening. 

Such  an  ovation  has  never  before  been  given. 
And  Amelia  Earhart,  the  lion-hearted  lady  who 
recently  flew  the  Atlantic  alone,  blushed  and 
smiled  like  a  school  girl. 

TLJARRISON  CARROLL  tells  one  about  the 

-^-Hollywood  actor  who  came  up  to  a  friend 
and  said: 

"  Say,  I  was  just  over  to  the  office  of  a  well 
known  director  on  this  lot.  His  secretary  was 
out  so,  without  thinking,  I  walked  into  the 
inner  office.  And,  what  do  you  suppose?  He 
was  kissing  a  beautiful  girl. " 

"Yeah,"  said  the  friend.  "Who  was  the 
girl?" 

The  actor  whispered  her  name. 

"You  don't  say!  And  who  was  the  director?" 

The  actor  drew  back. 

"Say,"  he  exclaimed,  "do  you  think  I'm 
a  cad?" 


When  Marlene  Dietrich  made 
"Shanghai  Express"  she  didn't  show 
even  so  much  as  a  dainty  ankle.  And 
did  the  movie-goers  howl!  "Okay," 
said  Marlene  in  a  throaty  guttural,  "if 
they  want  legs — I'll  give  'em  legs." 
And  this  is  the  way  she  got  herself 
decked  out  for  "The  Blonde  Venus." 
If  you  can  waste  your  time  looking  at 
the  lady's  wig,  you  will  discover  that 
it's  so  very,  very  blonde  and   exotic 


QUICK,  SAFE  SUDS 
without  hot  water 


This  is  the  way  to 
wash  your  woollies 


Ivory  Snow  is  pure— as  safe  for 
wools  as  Ivory  Soap  is  for  a  baby's 
tender  skin.  For  Ivory  Snow  is 
Ivory  Soap,  blown  into  fluffy  little 
puffs  so  that  it  will  dissolve  in- 
stantly. 

Ivory  Snow  doesn't  need  hot 
water  to  make  it  melt  into  a  rich 
lather  of  wonderful  suds.  You  can 
start  with  the  tepid  water  wools  re- 
quire. Ivory  Snow  will  dissolve 
completely.  It  has  no  flat  particles 
which  can  cling  to  the  fabric  and 
cause  a  soap  spot! 

Don't  rub  wool  garments.  Just 


swirl  and  squeeze  them  through 
gentle,  lukewarm  Ivory  Snow  suds. 
No  clingy  flake  particles  to  rub  out!

washing  wools— harsh  soap,  hot 
water,  and  rubbing. 

Ivory  Snow  is  extra  safe  and  con- 
venient for  washing  all  fine  fabrics. 
And  it  is  economical  to  use  lavishly, 
because  that  nice  big  package  costs 
only  15£!

"Ideal  soap  for  woolens,"  say  lead-

weavers  of  the  fine  Biltmore  Handwoven 
Homespuns,  the  makers  of  downy  Mari- 
posa blankets  and  the  Botany  Worsted 
Mills,  to  mention  only  a  few!  "Perfect

Brothers,  and  Truhu.

PRANCES  DEE  is  not  only  heartbroken,  but 
in  the  worst  quandary  of  her  life.    Her  hoy 

friend,  French-actor  Charles  Boyier,  has  re- 
turned to  Paris  for  at  least  six  months. 

This  is  really  one  of  the  lovely  love-stories 
of  pictures.  Frances  was  the  second  Mary 
Brian  of  the  city.  Popular  with  all  the  men. 
So  many  dates  she  had  nervous  breakdowns 
from  keeping  them.  The  college  girl  type  of 
popularity. 

Then  she  met  the  Frenchman.  Love  at  first 
sight.  He  was  leaving  for  France  in  a  week. 
Hi  begged  her  to  marry  and  return  with  him. 
But  she  couldn't  believe  that  real  love  comes 
that  quickly.  Letters;  cablegrams;  across-the- 
water    telephone    calls. 

Then  Boyier  returned  for  "The  Man  From 
Yesterday"  at  Paramount  and  the  love  d<  <  p 
ened.  But  Boyier's  English  'for  pictures,  not 
love-making)  needs  improvement.  He  must 
make  a  living.  He  had  a  splendid  six-months' 
offer  from  Paris.  He  took  it.  He  begged 
Frances  to  go  with  him  as  Mrs.  Boyier.  She 
wanted  to — howshe  wanted!  But  Frances  has  a 
career,  too.  She  has  a  family.  She  has  a 
future.  To  give  it  all  up  to  go  to  a  strange  land 
— perhaps   forever? 

She  speaks  no  French.  She's  a  one-hundred 
per  cent  American  gal  with  one-hundred  per 
cent  personal  ambition. 

The  old,  old  problem.  Career  versus  love. 
Neither  has  won.  She  admits  she  may  join  him 
any  moment.    Or  he  may  return. 

In  the  meantime,  she's  turning  to  work  as 
the  panacea! 

JACKIE  COOPER  Cute-Saying  for 
September — 

On  the  day  that  Jackie  commenced 
work  on  "Father  and  Son,"  he  walked 
up  to  Chuck  Reisner,  his  new  direc- 
tor, held  out  his  hand  and  announced, 
"I  think  this  is  going  to  develop  into 
a  beautiful  friendship  between  us 
two." 

HpHERE'S  a  scene  in  "Red-Headed  Woman" 
■*■  where  Chester  Morris  knocks  Jean  Harlow 
down. 

"Give  us  the  real  stuff,"  Director  Conway 
instructed.  "Don't  pull  your  punches, 
Chester!" 

He  didn't!  In  between  each  take,  the  prop 
boy  rushed  in  with  ice  and  poulticed  Jean's 
face  so  the  punches  would  not  leave  a 
swelling. 

JOAN  BENNETT  celebrated  the  first  anni- 
'  versary  of  her  broken-hip  accident  by  taking 
up  tennis  again. 

Of  all  the  things  which  Joan  was  forced  to 
forego  because  of  that  tumble  from  a  horse,  she 
missed  tennis  most!  Incidentally,  she  is  a 
cracker-jack  player. 


1 1  JnOSE  two  handsome  boys  of  Charlie 
A  Chaplin's  are  going  into  the  movies,  in  spite 
of  Charlie's  opposition.  A  contract  has  been 
drawn  up  with  Fox  Studios  and,  according  to 
report,  a  photostatic  copy  of  one  page  from 
Lita  Grey  Chaplin's  divorce  decree  is  attached 
to  the  contract.  It's  the  page  wherein  Mrs. 
Chaplin  is  named  sole  and  legal  guardian  of 
the  boys. 

So  it  looks  as  though  some  opposition  from 
Charles  Chaplin  was  expected. 

The  boys'  contract  calls  for  five  pictures,  at 
$35,000  per  picture. 

/"100D  old  Catalina  Island!  It 
^"*  never  rains  but  it  floods,  over 
there !  The  minute  Joan  Crawford 
and  Walter  Huston  finished  work  on 
"Rain"  at  Catalina,  another  com- 
pany sent  an  outfit  to  the  same  loca- 
tion to  shoot  a  film  called  "After  the 
Rain." 

A  T  the  Biltmore  Theater  here,  the  cast  of 

*"''The  Barretts  of  Wimpole  Street"  was 
thick  with  English  accents. 

Harrison  Carroll,  the  Hollywood  columnist, 
tells  the  story  of  a  certain  Hollywood  producer 
who  came  out  into  the  lobby  shaking  his  head 

"What's  the  matter?"  asked  a  friend. 
"Don't  you  like  the  show?'' 

"Do  I  like  it?"  said  the  producer.  "I  can't 
understand  it." 

"Smatter?    Seat  bad." 

"Vunderful  seats,"  he  said.    "Second  row." 

"Well,  then,  what  is  it?" 

"I  ask  you,"  groaned  the  producer,  "who 
can  understand  such  a  dialect?" 

/"*  UESS  what  those  South  Sea 
^"natives  called  Doug  Fairbanks, 
who's  been  busy  making  a  picture  on 
the  island  of  Tahiti? 

"Man  Whom  Devil  Fears."  And 
this,  if  you  please,  because  the  mos- 
quitoes never  bit  Mr.  Fairbanks' 
anatomy. 

The  natives  simply  figured  if  the 
skeeters  were  afraid  of  Doug,  so  was 
the  devil.    And  there  you  are ! 

Vt  7HENEVER  a  fire  truck  goes  screeching 
vv  down  Hollywood  Boulevard  the  natives 
look  for  Marion  Davies'  limousine  in  its  wake. 
Marion's  passion  for  fires  amounts  to  a  mania. 
Her  chauffeur  no  longer  needs  to  be  told  to 
follow  the  trucks.  When  he  hears  a  siren,  he 
automatically  swings  into  line. 

All  of  our  best  fires  find  Marion  among  those 
present.  She  attended  both  Malibu  holocausts 
— had  a  front  row  seat.  In  fact  there  hasn't 
been  an  important  conflagration  in  years  that 
hasn't  boasted  her  presence.

What  Price  Stardom? 


CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  57  ] 


Of  course,  her  first  three  million  dollar  pro- 
ductions did  make  money.  That  was  the  root 
of  the  trouble.  They  stamped  her  as  a  million 
dollar  actress. 

"What  Trice  Glory?"  cost  a  million,  but  it 
netted  between  four  and  five.  Together  with 
Janet  Gaynor's  "7th  Heaven"  it  brought 
the  Fox  company  into  the  limelight  as  a  large 
production  organization — lifted  it  from  a  firm 
that  had  been  known  largely  for  Tom  Mix 
Westerns. 


"Loves  of  Carmen"  and  "Ramona"  also 
showed  profits. 

With  these  three  successes,  what  chance  did 
Dolores  have  of  playing  in  small,  simple, 
human-interest  productions  of  the  type  that 
had  brought  Norma  Shearer,  Joan  Crawford 
and   others   to   stardom? 

Dolores'  gorgeous  beauty  must  have  gor- 
geous settings. 

She  was  definitely  typed  as  Hollywood's 
million  dollar  production  baby. 


Dolores  knew  what  was  coming, 
it.      She   begged   for   simple   roles    in   simple 
pictures.     It  was  a  waste  of  breath. 

She  wasn't  surprised  at  what  followed. 
"The  Trial  of  '98,"  "Revenge,"  "Evangeline" 
were  all  ultra-expensive  flops. 

"The  Bad  One"  was  her  first  talkie.  It 
would  have  made  a  nice  little  program 
picture  and  should  have  been  made  and 
billed  as  such.  But  no!  Del  Rio  was  the  star. 
That  meant  a  super-production.  It  cost 
$650,000  when  it  should  have  cost  less  than 
$250,000. 

With  four  poor  pictures  to  her  credit,  it  was 
decided  she  should  have  a  super-super-super. 
Something  more  pretentious  than  "What 
Price  Glory?,"  "Loves  of  Carmen"  and 
"Ramona"  combined.  An  extravaganza 
which  had  never  been  equalled. 

"HpHE  Dove"  was  chosen.    There  was  to  be 

■*•  no  end  to  the  millions  expended.  And  on 
the  fourth  day  after  they  started  work,  Dolores 
was  carried  to  the  hospital  with  what  threat- 
ened to  be  a  fatal  kidney  ailment.  According 
to  the  sick  clause  in  all  contracts,  the  studio 
had  to  wait  thirty  days  for  her  return.  United 
Artists  waited  four  months  before  they  can- 
celled Dolores'  contract  and  shelved  "The 
Dove." 

She  was  ill  for  a  year  and  a  half  and  lost 
exactly  $700,000.  She  was  receiving  $125,000 
a  picture  at  the  time. 

Dolores  believes  this  illness  to  have  been  the 
"worst  break  of  all."  She  often  says,  "If 
it  hadn't  been  for  my  getting  01 — ."  But  I 
think  she  is  wrong. 

"The  Dove"  was  as  well-known  as  is  "Bird 
of  Paradise."  Radio  bought  it  later  from 
United  Artists  for  $100,000  and  played 
Dolores  Del  Rio  in  it.  It  was  a  flop  and  only 
further  stamped  her  as  the  million  dollar  star 
whose  pictures  did  not  make  money. 

In  a  way,  that  illness  and  the  stopping  cf 
"The  Dove"  may  have  been  a  blessing.  Just 
as  the  severance  of  her  relations  with  Radio 
Pictures  will  probably  prove  one.  Now,  she 
is  definitely  through  with  million  dollar  pro- 
ductions. She  doesn't  even  care  whether  she 
is  starred.  She's  going  to  free  lance.  She 
wants  a  sophisticated,  drawing-room  drama 
in  which  she  can  wear  modern,  smart  clothes. 
With  the  most  perfect  figure  of  them  all  she 
has  never  had  an  opportunity  to  wear  modern 
clothes. 

Harry  Edington,  who  manages  Greta  Garbo, 
has  taken  over  Dolores'  career.  His  first 
move  is  an  attempt  to  break  this  million  dollar 
jinx.  He's  going  to  start  her  where  she  should 
have  started  in  the  first  place. 

And  the  saddest  point  of  all  is— Dolores' 
story  is  typical  of  so  many  others.  Lila  Lee 
started  with  a  million  dollars  worth  of  public- 
ity and  stardom  and  it  was  not  until  she  had 
lived  it  down  that  she  found  an  uncertain 
footing  in  the  business. 

Carman  Barnes  was  ballyhooed  as  the  new- 
star-of-all-time  by  Paramount.  Fabulous 
sums  were  spent  on  her  publicity.  She  was 
thrown  into  stardom  without  preparation  or 
training.  And  her  first — and  last — picture 
was  shelved. 

\ /TVRIAN  MARSH  was  starred  before  she 
•'■''■'■had  even  learned  camera  angles.  Now  she 
is  on  the  outside  trying  to  get  a  peep  back  in. 

Radio  Pictures  is,  today,  holding  back 
publicity  on  Gwili  Andre.  "Let's  see  what 
she  can  do  before  we  talk  about  her,"  is  their 
slogan.  Paramount  has  sent  Randolph  Scott 
to  school  to  learn  the  technique  of  camera 
acting.  The  studios  are  learning.  Too  bad 
they  didn't  learn  sooner  before  they  almost 
ruined  the  most  natural  beauty  of  them  all. 

We're  rooting  for  Dolores  Del  Rio's  come- 
back— no,  that's  the  wrong  word.  It's  not  a 
comeback  when  one  has  not  had  a  fair  start. 
We're  rooting  for  the  success  of  this  girl  who 
is  really  just  now  beginning.  We're  hoping 
that  her  story  will  be  a  lesson  to  producers 
and  newcomers  now  and  forever. 

But  it  won't.

A  dollar  — big  as  it  is  today —  becomes  a

finished  in  a  lace  design. 

And  the  very  finest  of  this  new  Rollins  line-

And  don't  let  your  innate  good  taste  tempt 
you  into  paying  the  extravagant  prices

I  CONTINUED  FROM  PACE  29  ] 


I  like,  somehow,  I  cannot  tell  you  exactly 
why,  to  think  of  Marie  in  terms  of  contrast. 
As,  on  the  screen,  she  swings  me  from  shrieks 
of  laughter  to  real  sobs,  as  she  passes  from  the 
dignity  of  an  empress  to  the  maddest  clowning 
— that  is  the  picture  of  Marie's  life. 

From  the  day  when,  at  thirteen — a  big, 
awkward  Canadian  kid — she  joined  one  of 
those  cheap  little  traveling  theatrical  com- 
panies, to  the  night  when  she  stood  before  a 
madly  cheering  throng  of  all  the  motion 
picture  celebrities  in  the  world  and  received 
the  Academy  medal  for  the  greatest  acting 
of  the  year. 

From  the  days  of  the  war  when,  in  a  few 
weeks,  she  delivered  one  hundred  and  forty- 
nine  speeches  and  sold  90,000,000  dollars  worth 
of  Liberty  bonds,  to  those  bleak  days  after  the 
war  when  she  was  flat  broke  and  couldn't  get 
a  job. 

In  the  war  hospitals,  before  our  wounded 
soldiers,  singing  a  sad  song  one  moment  and 
telling  them  a  funny  story  the  next. 

There  is  a  story  about  that  which  to  me  re- 
veals as  much  as  anything  I  know  the  heart 
of  Marie  Dressier,  the  understanding  for  which 
Solomon  prayed  as  the  greatest  gift  God 
could  give  him  and  which  Marie  has. 

Someone  asked  her  why  she  sang  sad  songs 
for  the  boys,  why  she  didn't  just  make  them 
laugh. 

And  Marie  fidgeted  and  smiled  and  finally 
said,  "You  see,  I  know  they  are  sad.  I  know 
they  want  to  cry — like  little  boys  who  are 
sick  and  frightened.  But  they  are  too  proud 
to  do  it.  So — if  I  sing  them  a  sad  song, 
they've  got  a  perfect  excuse  and  they  can  weep 
those  tears  which  take  a  load  from  the  heart." 

FROM  cheap  hall  bedrooms  where  she  cooked 
over  a  gas  jet,  to  the  stately,  charming  home 
with  its  beautiful  gardens  where  she  now  lives. 
From  that  classic  comic  song,  "Heaven  will 
protect  the  working  girl,"  to  the  majesty  of 
her  performance  in  "Anna  Christie."  From 
nights  when  she  slept  in  cold,  funny  old 
"opera  houses,"  because  the  snow  outside  was 
too  deep  for  her  to  get  back  to  her  hotel,  to 


nights  when  she  has  been  the  honored  guest  of 
such  women  as  Mrs.  Stuyvesant  Fish,  Lady 
Ravensdole,  Mrs.  U.  S.  Grant;  when  she  has 
jested  with  presidents  and  laughed  with  world 
leaders. 

When  she  was  a  little  girl,  Marie  was  the 
ugly  duckling.  And  she  had  one  sister,  a 
beautitul,  gold-haired  child  whom  everyone 
adored  and  admired.  Some  young  girls  are 
embittered  by  that.  The  ordinary  woman 
may  become  unkind,  resentful,  self-pitying, 
super-sensitive.  It  is  a  proof  of  the  thing 
that  is  within  Marie  Dressier  that  she  loved 
that  sister  better  than  anyone  else,  that  she 
was  always  calling  attention  to  her  beauty, 
always  putting  her  forward.  And  their 
father's  health  failing  and  desperate  poverty 
staring  them  in  the  face,  it  was  Marie  who,  at 
thirteen,  went  out  into  the  world  to  make  a 
living   for    the   family. 

SOMETIMES  Marie  mentions,  quite  sweetly, 
that  she  is  a  woman  of  no  education.  It  al- 
ways makes  me  laugh  to  hear  her  say  that. 
It  is  true,  of  course,  that  she  had  no  academic 
education,  that  she  didn't  go  to  school  very 
much. 

But  she  had  a  brain  like  a  sponge,  a  brain 
that  absorbed  and  a  heart  that  distilled 
knowledge.  And  for  forty-seven  years  she 
has  lived  with  people,  and  known  them,  and 
gained  from  them.  Vaudeville,  burlesque, 
the  lowest  ranks  of  the  chorus.  Stage  star- 
dom. Motion  picture  stardom.  Travel  all 
over  the  world.  These  things,  because  she 
knew  how  to  take  advantage  of  them,  have 
made  her  one  of  the  best-educated  women  in 
the  world.  There  is  no  situation  she  hasn't 
seen,  no  character  she  hasn't  met,  no  problem 
she  hasn't  faced. 

Perhaps  that  is  one  reason  she  has  been 
able  to  play  every  character  you  could  imagine 
on  the  screen. 

And  Marie  Dressier  knew  a  great  love — one 
and  one  only.  A  love  that  lasted  for  many 
years,  faithful,  complete,  beautiful.  It  is  the 
one  thing  of  which  she  never  speaks.  I 
think  it  is  because  she  cannot.    It  is  too  sacred.

Her  grief  at  his  death  is  an  ever-green  sorrow 
and  yet  she  has  learned  to  take  what  happi- 
ness she  can  from  the  memory  of  him. 

Today  Marie  Dressier  holds  a  great  place  in 
the  world,  not  only  upon  the  screen,  but  in  all 
the  affairs  of  life.  Her  voice  is  heard  upon  the 
radio  appealing  for  help  for  unemployed 
women.  Her  opinion  is  sought  upon  political 
questions  of  all  kinds. 

And  she  has  done  something  for  the  motion 
picture  industry — her  own  beloved  profession 
— which  we  of  Hollywood  cannot  forget.  She 
has  proved  to  us  for  all  time,  that  such  pictures 
as  "Emma" — such  pictures  as  "Min  and  Bill" 
— pictures  of  simplicity  and  beauty,  of  honest, 
down-to-earth  reality,  will  always  bring 
millions  to  the  box-office.  In  a  time  when 
we  are  fighting  to  know  what  the  public  wants, 
when  every  producer  is  striving  to  find  the 
right  medium  of  story,  Marie  Dressier  has 
meant  honesty  and  fineness. 

//  is  better  not  to  live  than  not  to  love. 

In  that  one  line  is  written  the  keynote  to 
Marie  Dressler's  philosophy  of  life. 

It  is  better  not  to  live  than  not  to  love. 

To  do  for  others — to  make  every  day  worth 
living — to  face  each  hour  with  a  high  heart, 
with  courage,  with  laughter.  To  serve  with 
loyalty  and  with  sweetness  in  the  work  that 
happens  to  be  ours  to  do. 

Those  things  are  written  large  in  her  life  and, 
in  a  way,  her  character  is  her  message. 

When  Norma  Shearer  presented  her  with 
the  Academy  medal  last  year  she  called  her, 
"the  grandest  trouper  of  them  all."  And  then, 
with  a  smile,  and  with  tears  in  her  eyes,  Norma 
called  her,  "the  grand  old  fire  horse  of  the 
screen." 

MARIE  loved  it.  For  she  knew  that  it  mean  t  a 
great  tribute.  Unfailing  response,  unfailing 
effort,  always  giving  the  best  and  more  than 
the  best — that's  what  Norma  Shearer  meant 
when  she  used  that  homely  phrase. 

From  such  a  woman,  philosophy  comes 
gaily,  -deeply,  truly.  Her  views  upon  mar- 
riage, upon  youth,  upon  everyday  problems 
must  give  us  laughter  and  tears. 

Today  she  is  one  of  the  great  women  of 
the  world.  When  you  read  the  story  of  her 
life's  philosophy  in  the  next  two  issues  of 
Photoplay,  you  will  know  why. 

And  don't  forget  that  she  is  giving  it  to  you, 
freely,  in  spite  of  pain  and  overwork  and 
service  in  many,  many  fields  during  these 
trying  days.  She  is  giving  it  to  you  just 
because  she  believes  it  might  help  you.  It  is 
her  gift  to  you — because  she  loves  you  as 
vou  love  her.

roared.  Jack  smiled,  was  shot  and  died  eleven 
times  straight  with  the  smoke  blowing  and  tem- 
perature rising. 

He  didn't  mind.  He  climbed  out  of  the 
plane  with  a  grin. 

"Take  off  that  heavy  suede  jacket  or  you'll 
smother,"  we  urged. 

He  kept  it  on. 

"  For  heaven's  sake,"  someone  else  said  in 
passing,  "take  off  that  jacket  or  you'll  pass  out 
in  here." 

He  grew  a  bit  confused.  And  grinned  sheep- 
ishly. And  turned  watermelon  pink  and  con- 
fessed. He  hadn't  expected  visitors  and  was 
just  raw  underneath. 

Clothes?  Shucks,  he  isn't  bothered  about 
them.  Usually  trots  around  in  white  linen 
trousers  and  sweater  and  a  scarf  tied  about  his 
neck. 

It's  amusing  about  the  New  York  stage  star, 
newly  arrived  in  Hollywood,  who  was  attend- 
ing a  swanky  military  ball  and  went  into  near 
hysterics  over  the  tall,  handsome  man  who 
wore  his  full  dress  suit  like  a  fashion  plate.  And 
danced  with  a  divine  grace  that  outshone  any 
man  present.

Half  FaceTest 


You  powder  your  face  with  a  face  powder  ...  a 
powder  especially  for  your  complexion. 

You  soften  your  skin  with  face  creams  .  .  .  made 
to  suit  the  delicate  tissues  of  your  skin. 

Then  cleanse  your  skin  not  just  with  any  soap, 
but  with  Woodbury's  Facial  Soap  ...  a  specialized 
soap,  definitely  prepared  for  the  complexion. 

Woodbury's  is  a  FACIAL  soap  .  .  .  made  with 
cosmetic  ingredients  not  usually  found  in  soaps. 
•  It  is  infinitely  better  suited  to  your  skin  than  an 
ordinary  soap  which  is  also  intended  for  the  laun- 
dry and  bath.  Woodbury's  formula  was  not 
created  by  a  soap  chemist,  but  by  a  skin  specialist. 
Woodbury's  is  not  sold  in  chip,  flake,  or  any  other 
form  for  kitchen  or  laundry  use.  It  is  much  too 
fine,  too  specialized  a  soap  for  that.  Besides 
cleansing,  Woodbury's  Facial  Soap  provides  a 
stimulating  and  corrective  beauty  treatment. 

The  superiority  of  Woodbury's  Facial  Soap  was 
proved  when  15  leading  dermatologists  supervised 
a  scientific  test  on  612  women's  faces.  For  30 
days,  each  woman  cared  for  one  side  of  her 
face  with  any  creams,  lotions,  soaps,  etc.,  she 
wished.  The  other  side  of  her  face  she  washed 
with  Woodbury's  Facial  Soap. 

Records  of  that  Half-face  Test  show  that  Wood- 
bury's softened  dry  skin,  brightened  dull  skin, 
checked  oiliness,  benefited  coarse  pores,  cleared 
blemishes  .  .  .  more  than  other  soaps  and  other 
beauty  methods  did  on  the  same  faces. 

YOU  try  Woodbury's  Facial  Soap  against  any  pet 
facial  treatment  YOU  have.  The  results  will  win 
you  to  using  Woodbury's  faithfully  from  then  on. 
It  costs  less  than  1^  a  day  to  use  Woodbury's. 
At  all  drug  stores  and  toilet  goods  counters.

GREATEST 
PICTURE 
OF  THE      J  £ 
YEAR! 


Ask  your  theatre  when  it  will  show  "AMERICAN  MADNESS" 


' '  Who  is  he?  Who  is  he?  "  she  kept  whisper- 
ing, "he  must  be  a  Continental."  "Conti- 
nental, my  eye,"  came  the  surprising  reply, 
"that's  Jack  Holt." 

And  the  lady  nearly  passed  out. 

For  Jack  can  wear  clothes  when  he  has  to, 
and  they  fit  his  splendid  frame  with  a  certain 
dash. 

There's  a  calm  ruggedness  about  his  face. 
His  lower  lip  protrudes.  His  eyes  are  small  and 
very  brown.  And  twinkle  with  amusement. 
He  has  to  do  something  about  his  rapidly 
thinning  hair. 

He  wouldn't  know  a  smart  quip  if  it  up  and 
quipped  him  in  the  face.  He  speaks  directly 
and  man  to  man.  Xo  wisecracking.  Or  ex- 
changing of  bon  mots. 

A  NY  one  can  walk  onto  the  set  and  talk  to 
■*  *-him.  There's  nothing  of  the  aura  of  "  hands 
off"  that  usually  surrounds  a  star.  He's  easy. 
And  natural.  A  man's  man.  And  a  woman's 
man.  The  kind  that  happen  often  in  books  and 
rarely  in  life. 

He  owns  a  ranch  somewhere  beyond  Fresno, 
with  2,000  head  of  cattle.  Four  cowboys,  one 
wife,  two  girls  and  one  boy.  And  the  minute 
the  last  scene  has  been  shot,  he's  on  his  way 
ranchward.  And  is  into  the  saddle  in  a  jiffy. 
One  of  the  cowhands. 

"What  are  you  going  to  do  now,  Mr.  Holt?" 
an  interviewer  once  asked  him,  "now  that 
talkies  are  coming  in?" 

He  looked  at  her  in  that  puzzled  way  of  his. 
"Why,  I'm  going  to  talk,  lady,"  he  said.  "I 
always  have.  See?"  and  to  the  utter  amaze- 
ment of  the  interviewer  he  demonstrated  very 
slowly  and  distinctly  his  ability  to  talk. 

Some  of  his  best  pictures  have  been  made 
with  director  Frank  Capra.  "Submarine," 
"Flight"  and  "Dirigible"  were  among  the 
Capra  films.  And  it's  a  bit  funny  the  way 
they  met. 

Holt  and  Ralph  Graves  had  gone  down  the 
coast  to  make  a  picture.  And  everything 
was  wrong.  The  director  proved  a  dud  and 
left.  It  rained,  someone  got  the  hiccoughs 
and  either  wouldn't  or  couldn't  stop  and 
someone  else  came  down  with  tonsilitis  or 
something.  It  was  awful.  And  there  they 
were,  stuck. 

Capra  had  just  been  let  out  of  a  Fangdon 
picture.  Here  he  was,  unsung,  unknown  and 
certainly  jobless. 

A  friend  met  him  strolling  aimlessly  down 
Hollywood  Boulevard.  Frank  explained  his 
plight  to  his  friend. 

"Come  with  me,"  the  friend  said,  "got  a  job 
for  you."  And  the  next  day  the  little  un- 
imposing  Italian  arrived  to  take  over  the 
Holt-Graves  catastrophe.  Well  sir,  they  took 
one  look  at  their  savior  and  passed  out  in 
droves.  They  argued  and  fought  and  packed 
for  home.  At  last,  in  desperation,  Holt 
argued  to  let  Capra  try  it. 

He  tried  it.  And  "Submarine"  was  the 
result.  And  he's  been  the  bright  spot  in 
Jack's,  and  many  another  star's  career  ever 
since.  With  "Flight"  and  "Dirigible"  soon 
following. 

HE'S  had  120  hours  in  the  air,  this  Holt.  And 
had  given  up  polo  before  more  than  two 
people  in  town  learned  it  wasn't  played  on  the 
dining  room  table.  In  1926  he  rated  a  two- 
goal  handicap  in  national  polo  rating  but 
gave  it  up  because  it  proved  too  expensive. 
Today  he's  in  constant  demand  as  referee  at 
all  the  big  military  games. 

His  closest  friends  are  among  army  and  navy 
men.  They  are  the  type  that  appeal  to  him 
most. 

The  studio  wouldn't  let  him  fly  in  his  new 
picture,  "War  Correspondent."  Roy  Wilson, 
a  crack  fiver,  was  hired  as  a  substitute.  Jack 
sat  and  thrilled  to  Roy's  skillful  handling  of 
the  plane  in  the  air.  And  his  boy  Tim,  just 
thirteen,  sat  beside  and  thrilled  with  his  dad. 

Tim  had  always  wanted  to  go  up  and  at  last 
Jack  consented.     Tim  went  up  with  Wilson. 

And  somehow  for  the  first  time  in  all  those 
eighteen   years,   Holt's   mind    wasn't   on  his 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  September,  1932

work.  He  was  restless.  Uneasy.  Above 
location  the  plane  droned  reassuringly. 

And  then  the  half  hour  was  over. 

And  Tim  was  back. 

And  Jack  snapped  into  his  old  routine  again. 

A  few  hours  later  the  hum  of  Wilson's 
plane  could  again  be  heard  off  in  the  distance. 

And  then  suddenly  there  was  a  sickening 
silence  and  Roy  Wilson  was  dead.  Tim's 
pilot  had  lost. 

It  broke  Jack  up. 

The  quiet  sort  of  fellows  like  Jack  feel  things 
pretty  deeply. 

"V"ES,  Jack  Holt  is  a  man.  He's  worked  hard 
■*■  at  his  business.  He's  kept  his  slate  clean  and 
his  record  clear. 

He's  given  eighteen  years  of  downright, 
solid  entertainment. 

With  no  fuss  or  hullabaloo. 

And  something  tells  me  that  when  some 
of  the  flashy  laddies  of  the  screen  today  are 
just  a  pleasant  memory,  Jack  Holt  will  be 
going  right  on. 

For  eighteen  years  more,  anyhow.

Attorney  for  Defense — Are  you  the  Chita 
who  appeared  in  "Tarzan,"  in  support  of 
Johnny  Weissmuller's  torso? 

Phifer's  Chita— Judge,  did  you  ever  hear 
the  one  about  the  two  apes  named  Oogly  and 
Woogly  who  stopped  at  a  small  farmhouse  up- 
state, and — 

Justice  Doze — Yes.  Answer  the  lawyer's 
question. 

Attorney  for  Defense — Did  you  tell  Len 
Hall,  better  known  as  Frank  S.  Buck,  a  Photo- 
play reporter,  that  you  appeared  in  "Tarzan  "? 

Phifer's  Chita — Well,  I  appeared  at  the 
Boston  Store,  the  Big  Bazar,  O'Connell  and 
O'Klein  in  Philly  and  several  other  places.  Me 
and  Cap  might  have  done  our  stuff  in  "Tarzan," 
wherever  that  store  is. 

Attorney  for  Defense — Do  you  know  Len 
Hall,  better  known  as  Clark  Gable,  personally? 

Phifer's  Chita — Do  I  know  him?  Do  I 
know  Len  Hall?  Why,  we  had  our  picture  took 
together!    He's  a  darling,  he's — 

Attorney  for  Defense — Let's  keep  sex  out 
of  this!  Did  you  or  did  you  not  appear  in 
"Tarzan"? 

Phifer's  Chita — Judge,  that  reminds  me  of 
the  time  I  was  down  on  the  Rapidan  with 
Hoover,  and — 

Attorney  for  Defense — I'll  beat  your 
skull  in  when  I  get  you  outside.  That's  my 
case,  your  honor. 

Justice  Doze — (who  has  been  snoring  in 
A-Flat  for  a  few  minutes) — Ladies  and  gentle- 
men, lawyers  and  apes,  you  can't  make  a  mon- 
key out  of  this  court.    It  remains — • 

Walter  Winchell — fan  old  Civil  War  tran- 
som-duster)— Then  who  did?    Hehehe! 

Justice  Doze — That  will  cost  you  ten,  Win- 
chell. As  stated  in  the  case  of  Amos  vs.  Andy, 
State  of  Idaho,  Page  1905,  c  pluribus  union 
multum  in  parvo  and  a  dash  of  bitters.  The 
court  finds,  after  due  deliberation,  that  Major 
Barsky's  Chita  appeared  in  "Tarzan,  The  Ape 
Man.  "  Cap  Phifer's  Chita,  on  the  other  hand, 
had  her  photograph  taken  with  a  notorious 
magazine  reporter  and  hi-jacker.  We  find  for 
the  plaintiff  in  the  sum  of  a  bunch  of  red  bana- 
nas. 

Walter  Winchell — (a  retired  keyhole-pol- 
isher)— Life  is  just  a  bowl  of  Chitas!    Hehehe! 

Justice  Doze — Ten  more,  Winchell. 
Court's  adjourned. 

(The  two  Chitas  leap  into  the  witness  box 
and  scratch  each  other  tenderly.  They  then 
sing,  "  So  I  Chita  you,  and  you  Chita  me,  under 
the  bamboo  tree!"  The  celebrated  case  of 
Chita  vs.  Chita,  or  who  put  the  ape  in  "Tar- 
zan," is  over.    Thank  goodness!)

modern  safety  factor 


TO  build  strong,  hard  teeth  is  the 
purpose  of  right  diet.  You  must  eat 
foods  rich  in  essential  minerals  and  in 
vitamins.  But  building  teeth  is  only  half ! 
You  must  preserve  teeth  too.  That  is 
done  by  removing  destructive  film  each 
day.  To  preserve  teeth  Pepsodent  Tooth- 
paste was  especially  developed. 

Remove  film  from  teeth 

Film  is  the  greatest  single  enemy  of 
teeth.  Film  covers  teeth  with  a  gelatin- 
like coating.  In  it  are  germs  glued 
against  enamel  .  . .  producing  acids  that 
dissolve  the  enamel,  penetrate  the  tooth 
and  finally  reach  the  nerve. 

Film  absorbs  the  stain  from  food  and 
smoking — and  ruins  the  most  charming 
smile.  Film  clings  stubbornly  to  teeth  — 
sticks  so  defiantly  that  toothpaste  manu- 
facturers have  spent  years  in  seeking 
the  ideal  material  to  remove  it.  Now 
Pepsodent  has  found  it!  A  revolutionary 
cleansing  and  polishing  material  entirely 
new  and  different. 

New  safety  for  teeth 
This  new  material  removes  film  quickly 
and  effectively.  As  it  removes  film-coats 
it  polishes  enamel  to  high  brilliance.

NO 

after-effects 

with  this  safe, 
gentle  Laxative! 


The  laxative  you're  using  may  "work" 
all  right. 

But  does  it  work  safely  or  harmfully — in 
the  long  run?  Does  it  nave  any  harmful 
after-effects?  Do  you  really  know? 

Violent  laxatives  cause  elimination  of 
the  food  waste  in  utter  disregard  of  the 
normal  action  of  the  bowel  muscles.  Often 
they  are  habit-forming.  Repeated  dosing 
with  violent  cathartics  does  more  harm 
than  good. 

Acts  as  Nature  does 

The  right  kind  of  laxative  works  like 
Nature.  It  gently  stimulates  your  bowel 
muscles  to  return  to  work.  It  gives  these 
muscles  just  a  friendly  "nudge"  when 
normal  action  is  delayed. 

That's  the  way  Ex-Lax  works! 

Ex-Lax  does  not  rob  your  bowel  muscles 
of  their  natural  impulse  to  function  prop- 
erly. Ex-Lax  helps  these  muscles  to  func- 
tion easily  and  normally  —  as  Nature 
intended.  Ex-Lax  gives  Nature  gentle, 
friendly,  but  effective  aid.  That's  why 
doctors  everywhere  approve  the  Ex-Lax 
way. 

No  secret  about  Ex-Lax 

Phenolphthalein  is  the  only  medicinal  in- 
gredient in  Ex-Lax.  The  Ex-Lax  formula 
combines  this  famous  laxative  agent  with 
a  delicious  chocolated  base — in  just  the 
right  proportion,  the  right  quality,  the 
right  dose,  to  produce  best  results. 

Ex-Lax  does  not  gripe.  It  is  not  habit- 
forming.  It  does  not  disturb  digestion. 

If  you've  been  using  the  wrong  kind  of 
laxative,  get  Ex-Lax.  At  all  drug  stores —

Hollywood  Is  A  Woman's  Town

three  women.  Gary  would  have  given  that  kind 
of  party  at  all? 

Vou  never  hear  of  men  in  Hollywood  getting 
together  to  play  poker  and  drink  beer  until  the 
dawn!     You  rarely  hear  of  stag  parties  at  all. 

Bob  Montgomery  once  gave  one  for  Noel 
Coward.  "All  we  did  was  sit  and  talk,"  he 
says,  as  if  that  were  the  most  astonishing  thing 
he  had  ever  heard. 

'And  they  stayed  until  four  in  the  morning. 
It  was  grand,  really!"  But  he  never  gave 
another. 

Which  leads  one  to  wonder  whether  men 
would  choose  to  play  ping-pong  and  "murder" 
and  backgammon.  Whether  men.  left  to  them- 
selves, would  spend  hours  and  hours  putting 
jig-saw  puzzles  together,  while  wearing  dinner 
coats. 

That's  what  they  do  at  Constance  Bennett's 
dinner  parties  And  Connie's  parties  are 
models  for  all  Hollywood. 

JOEL  McCREA,  who  is  one  of  our  most  be- 
leaguered bachelors,  says  that  Hollywood  men 
never  take  any  initiative  about  these  matters 
at  all. 

"Women  tell  us  what  to  do  and  when  to  do 
it."  he  said.  "They  are  amazingly  adroit 
about  it.  I  find  that  I  go  to  nearly  every  open- 
ing that  occurs.  Vet  I  can't  remember  that  I 
have  ever  planned  to  attend  one,  on  my  own 
initiative.  It  usually  happens  like  this.  I  am 
calling  on  a  girl  and  she  says,  '  "Grand  Hotel" 
opens  Thursday,  doesn't  it?'  I  say,  'Why,  I 
guess  it  does.'  She  drops  the  subject.  A  little 
later,  when  I  am  taking  leave  of  her,  I  say, 
'When  may  I  see  you  again?  Tuesday?'  Now, 
she  is  busy  Tuesday.  She  is  busy,  it  seems, 
every  evening  except  Thursday — and  she  had 
rather  thought  of  going  to  the  opening.  So  I 
say,  'Well,  why  not  go  with  me?'  And  she 
does. 

"I  always  find  that  I  am  glad  it  came  about 
that  way.    She  looks  charming  and  we  see  lots 


of  people  we  know  and  it  is  all  rather  nice.  But 
I  never  should  have  planned  it  myself! 

"As  a  matter  of  fact,  I  think  I  should  never 
call  on  a  girl  at  all  unless  she  invited  me.  They 
have  the  control  of  these  matters  so  thoroughly 
in  their  own  hands  that  we  simply  don't  expect 
it  to  be  any  other  way.  If  a  girl  doesn't  ask  me 
to  come  and  see  her — and  set  a  definite  time 
for  it — I  take  it  for  granted  that  she  doesn't 
care  to  see  me.  I  leave  it  to  her  to  decide 
whether  we  shall  go  to  someone's  party  or  dine 
in  the  country  or  go  dancing.  I  don't  care. 
And  it  wouldn't  do  me  a  bit  of  good  if  I  did!" 

Joel,  however,  has  his  moments  when  he 
flees  from  all  this  femininity.  He  had  his  first 
vacation  a  little  while  ago — having  made 
twelve  pictures  in  almost  the  same  number  of 
months.  He  hied  himself  to  the  ocean  and 
slept  in  a  tent  on  the  sand;  stayed  there  by 
himself  for  the  entire  time  and  cooked  his 
meals  over  a  little  lire.  Which  wouldn't  be  any 
woman's  idea  of  a  way  to  spend  a  rare  vacation ! 

How  many  men  would  actually  choose  to  go 
to  the  Mayfair  parties,  if  left  to  themselves?'  I 
haven't  been  able  to  find  one  who  would  admit 
that  he  would  go  unless  some  woman  urged 
him.  Vet  those  parties  are  very  well  attended 
and  there  is  certainly  no  dearth  of  men  at  any 
of  them. 

nTHE  Montmartre  and  the  Embassy  Club 
*■  were  both  designed  to  appeal  to  women — 
thick-carpeted,  llower-decked.  The  menu  fea- 
tures salads  and  chicken-in-aspic  andsweetbread 
patties.  But  the  Brown  Derby  started  out  to 
be  a  distinctly  masculine  restaurant.  It 
featured  Hamburg  steak,  served  sizzling, 
straight  from  the  fire,  in  its  own  iron  skillet. 
But  now — the  lunch  hour  there  grows  later  and 
later,  as  people  dally  over  their  coffee,  waiting 
for  a  glimpse  of  Lilyan  Tashman's  newest 
saucer  hat.  The  menu  boasts  a  "Ladies' 
Special"  every  day  now — chicken  short  bread 
or  a  turkey  cutlet.

Richard  Dix  feels  pretty  secure  about  his  own  marriage  when  he  considers 
the  grand  example  that  has  been  set  for  him.  Here  he  is  with  his  mother 
and  father,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  E.  C.  Brimmer,  who  recently  celebrated  their 
fiftieth  wedding  anniversary  at  their  home  in  Hollywood.  And  would  you 
look  at  them  closely?    They're  still  holding  hands.     Scandalous,  sez  we!

Voices  are  subdued  and  fans  cluster  about 
the  door  to  beg  for  autographs  and  criticise 
the  women's  clothes. 

Lunch  at  the  Derby  is  a  fashion  parade 
these  days. 

And  no  longer  do  you  see  tables  occupied 
by  comfortable,  besweatered  men,  thrashing 
out  production  problems  over  plates  of  corned 
beef  and  cabbage! 

Men  without  coats  are  no  longer  admitted  to 
the  Derby. 

The  place  has  gone  feminine. 

THERE  is  not  a  men's  shop  on  the  Boulevard 
which  does  not  have  a  woman's  section,  de- 
voted to  feminine  sports  apparel.  Florists  tell 
me  that  the  demand  for  really  rare  orchids,  at 
any  price,  grows  apace  and  that  on  gala  days  it 
is  impossible  to  buy  orchids  at  all  unless  you 
order  them  days  in  advance ! 

Automobile  dealers  say  that  their  customers 
in  the  film  colony  are  demanding  luxurious 
closed  cars  equipped  with  vanity  cases  and 
crystal  vases,  with  gold  and  silver  accessories, 
in'place  of  the  open  sports  roadsters  of  a  year 
or  two  ago. 

I  haven't  seen  a  cowboy  hat  or  a  pair  of 
golf  knickers  in  a  night  club  in  a  year. 

Maybe  it's  the  influence  of  the  people  from 
the  New  York  stage.  Eastern  women  have 
always  known  better  how  to  control  their  men 
than  we  have. 

Perhaps  it  is  the  growing  power  of  women 
like  the  smart  and  ultra-sophisticated  Con- 
stance Bennett  and  Lil  Tashman. 

Maybe  our  men  are  just  getting  a  little  effete. 
I  don't  know.  But  you  can  see  how  the  wind 
is  blowing. 

Personally,  I  am  going  to  stay  ri^ht  here 
and  enjoy  it! 


Folks— That's  Romance 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  51  ] 


job  after  another,  he  turned  to  the  stage  simply 
to  earn  a  living.  Before  he  could  get  fairly 
started,  the  trenches  claimed  him.  Invalided 
home,  he  turned  to  the  theater  again  at  a  time 
when  theaters  were  booming  and  actors  in 
great  demand. 

Suffering  had  matured  him  beyond  his 
years,  so  a  young  man  brought  depths  of 
feeling  from  the  front  lines  of  France  across  the 
footlights  of  London. 

Edna  Best,  on  the  other  hand,  had  the  usual 
illusions  that  young  girls  have  about  the  glam- 
our of  the  footlights.  She  entered  a  dramatic 
school  at  sixteen  and  served  the  average  ap- 
prenticeship of  road-show  hardships.  Impa- 
tient with  her  understudy  days,  she  determined 
to  find  an  opportunity  that  would  prove  her 
ability,  and  was  just  about  to  resign  from  the 
company  and  try  to  find  a  leading  role  for  her- 
self when  the  star  of  the  troupe  became  ill  and 
the  understudy  had  her  opportunity.  Edna 
played  the  leading  role — was  seen,  appreciated 
and  graduated  from  understudying. 

DURING  the  first  season  in  London,  she 
met  Herbert  Marshall! 

Hollywood  has  not  had  a  successful  co-star- 
ring husband  and  wife  team  since  many  years 
before  the  talkies. 

It  is  the  ardent  desire  of  both  Mr.  and  Mrs. 
Marshall  to  act  together  on  the  American 
screen.     They  did  in  England. 

They  were  eminently  successful  on  the  New 
York  stage  in  "There's  Always  Juliet."  Hol- 
lywood producers  have  sought  them  sepa- 
rately, but  never  as  a  couple.  Yet,  when  they 
work  together,  they  seem  to  give  each  other 
so  much. 

Wouldn't  it  be  the  perfect  culmination  to 
this  beautiful,  true  love  story  for  them  to  send 
their  message  throughout  the  world  by  playing 
together  in  many  American  pictures? 


Save  ELASTICITY 

— it  makes  stockings  jit 


Those  dowdy  little  wrinkles  at  the 
ankle  and  heel. .  .seams  that  ride  around 
.  .  .  do  you  know  why  they  happen? 

When  your  stockings  are  new, 
they  fit  smoothly  and  hug  the  leg 
closely  because  the  silk  threads  are 
elastic.  They  give,  then  spring  back 
into  shape. 

But  when  elasticity  is  lost — then 
the  stockings  wrinkle  and  bag  where 
they  should  fit  most  snugly!  Seams

are  apt  to  ride  around  and  if  you 
fasten  garters  more  tightly  to  try  to 
keep  them  in  place — then  the  lifeless 
threads  break.  Another  run  starts! 

Don't  take  chances  that  may  ruin 
stockings!  Lux  is  especially  made  to 
preserve  the  elasticity  that  makes 
stockings  keep  their  flattering^/,  and

WASH  Fashions  Individual 

your   FACE! 


by  Seymour 


["  COULDN'T  imagine  what  Henry 
■*-  meant  until  he  showed  me  how 
painted  my  lips  really  looked." 

\^  hat  about  your  own  lips?  Do  they 
have  that  painted  look  all  men  dislike 
so?  Perhaps  they  seem  natural  to  you 
.  .  .  yet  they  may  look  obvious  and 
unattractive  to  others. 

So  use  Tangee,  by  all  means.  It  can't 
make  you  look  painted. . .  it  isn't  paint. 
It's  entirely  different  ...  in  the  stick 
it  looks  orange  .  .  .  but  once  on  the 
lips  it  changes  to  the  one  color  most 
becoming  to  you. 

And  Tangee  is  permanent ...  it  won't 
smear.  Try  it  today  ...  at  any  druggist's 
or  cosmetic  counter.  Or  send  IOC  for 
the  Miracle  Make-up  Set. 


SO  many  of  you  have  mentioned  the  clothes 
that  Joan  Crawford  wore  in  "Letty 
Lynton"  that  I  know  you  will  be  interested 
to  hear  that  she  took  one  of  the  gowns  abroad 
with  her.  No,  it  wasn't  the  frou-frou  organdie 
one,  but  that  stunning  white  evening  ensemble 
she  wore  the  night  she  paced  the  deck  with  Bob 
Montgomery.    Remember  it? 

And  Adrian  made  Joan  any  number  of  those 
little  side-slanted  hats  for  her  European  ward- 
robe, too. 

JUST  before  sailing  from  New  York,  Joan  did 
some  busy  shopping.  She  isn't  going  to  buy 
much  abroad  because  she  says  she  hasn't  the 
time.  She  did  tell  me  a  grand  evening  gown 
gag  though.  Listen  carefully.  She  has  a 
plain,  straight  evening  gown  that  looks  almost 
like  a  slip  except  that  it  is  made  of  a  rich,  heavy 
crepe  in  deep  blue.  Over  this  she  wears  a 
puffed  sleeve  blouse  tying  high  about  her  waist. 
She  has  several  of  these — one  in  plain  organdie, 
one  in  eyelet  batiste  and  still  another  in  dotted 
Swiss.  Each  blouse  is  a  little  different  in 
design  and  color  so  that  one  evening  gown  looks 
like  several! 

You  could  do  the  same  thing  for  a  fall  even- 
ing costume,  only  not  have  such  summery 
materials  for  the  blouses.  Those  sleeves,  by  the 
way,  are  the  huge  puffed  variety  a  la  the 
gay  '90s. 

T— TOLLYWOOD  is  giving  black  satin  a  hand 
■*•  -Mor  daytime.  It  is  usually  relieved  with 
white  accessories,  however.  Watch  this  trend 
for  fall. 

In  "Blondie  of  the  Follies"  Billie  Dove  in- 
troduces something  new  in  ties  for  the  informal 
riding  habit.  Look  for  it  when  you  see  the 
picture.  It  is  white  angel  skin  satin,  quite 
short,  and  tied  in  a  casual  knot  beneath  the 
collar  of  her  blouse. 


T  OXGER  evening  wraps  for  this  winter  are  a 
-"certainty.  Already  they  are  appearing  more 
and  more  often  at  swanky  Hollywood  affairs. 
Big  sleeves  that  puff  and  billow  out  above  the 
elbow  and  high  flaring  collars  are  important 
details.  These  huge  puffed  sleeves  also  appear 
on  the  short  jackets  which  continue  to  hold 
their  own. 

Leave  it  to  Norma  Shearer  to  change  her 
type  when  she  felt  there  was  danger  of  its  be- 
coming a  rubber  stamp.  When  you  see  her  in 
"Smilin'  Through"  she  will  be  as  quaintly 
demure  as  an  old  valentine.  Under  one 
costume  she  wears  yards  and  yards  of  ruffled 
petticoat.  Now  you  can't  complain  about  her 
daring  clothes.  Norma  also  wears  very,  very 
British  tweeds  in  this  picture,  too. 

That  clever  young  designer,  Josette  de  Lima, 
has  made  a  sports  coat  that  you  will  all  want. 
It  is  designed  after  the  French  vineyard  boy's 
blouse.  It  has  the  swagger  lines  that  are  so 
popular  and  its  blue  suede  material  makes  it  a 
very  striking  garment. 

"PYER  since  buttons  started  filing  up  femi- 
J— 'nine  backs  and  attracting  attention,  back 
interest  in  fashion  is  increasing.  At  a  luncheon 
party  in  Hollywood  the  other  day,  a  smartly 
dressed  star's  back  caught  everyone's  eye  be- 
cause her  white  pique  collar  had  a  large  white 
pique  flower  posed  right  at  the  back  of  the 
neck.  All  this  topped  a  blue  and  white  plaid 
frock. 

The  trend  for  rough  surfaced  silks  that  look 
almost  like  wool  is  sponsored  by  Connie 
Bennett.  She  wears  a  pale  blue  ensemble  of 
gown  and  short  jacket  made  of  that  Schiapa- 
relli  crepe — its  texture  looks  like  the  rough 
graining  in  wood.  She  and  Joan  did  a  sister 
act  in  twin  sailor  beach  pyjamas  at  a  recent 
Malibu  party.  A  tip  for  sisters  who  don't  mind 
looking  alike!

read  the  riot  act  and  what  I  mean  is,  it  is  a  riot 
act! 

"  T  SEE  to  it  that  there  is  no  waste  and  nothing 
-•-thrown  away.  If  we  have  corned  beef  for 
dinner  one  night  there  has  got  to  be  corned  beef 
hash  for  luncheon  the  next  day.  If  there  is 
turkey  for  dinner  on  Sunday  night  there  must 
be  turkey  croquettes  for  luncheon  on  Monday. 
"There  isn't  an  item,  however  small,  that  I 
don't  consider  and  check  up  on.  The  flowers, 
for  instance — in  a  house  the  size  of  ours  flowers 
are  an  item.  We  always  have  them  around  and 
like  them  to  look  beautiful.  White  gladioli  in 
silver  bowls,  for  instance,  and  blue  delphinium 
and  lilies  in  Mildred's  and  my  bedroom. 
During  certain  seasons  of  the  year  our  own 
hot-houses  and  gardens  supply  the  flowers  for 
the  house.  There  are  off  seasons  when  it  is 
necessary  to  buy  them.  I  buy  them  at  a 
wholesaler's,  which  saves  us  several  dollars  a 
week.  I  also  see  to  it  that  they  are  not  changed 
too  often  or  unnecessarily.  .  .  ."  (I  know  of 
no  other  star  in  any  state  of  finance  who  would 
even  think  of  buying  flowers  from  a  flower 
wholesaler !) 


"  Mildred  dresses  and  lives,  personally,  on  an 
allowance.  .1  give  her  three  hundred  dollars  a 
week.  And  she  must  and  she  does  keep  within 
that  weekly  sum — for  everything.  All  of  her 
clothes  and  luncheon  and  theater  money — 
everything.  I  don't  care  what  she  does  with 
it.  She  can  save  it  or  give  it  away.  She  can 
spend  the  whole  three  hundred  dollars  on  one 
dress  or  buy  ten  for  thirty  dollars,  which  is 
about  the  sum  she  usually  does  spend  on  a 
dress. 

"But  whatever  she  does  with  it,  that  is  all 
she  gets  and  she  must  keep  within  it. 

"We  have  no  charge  accounts.  There  are 
none  allowed  in  our  household.  Once,  when 
we  were  first  married  and  were  in  Xew  York, 
Mildred  got  verv  giddv  and  ran  up  some  bills 
to  the  tune  of  $18,000.  I  paid  the  bills,  but 
that  was  the  last  money  Mildred  saw  the  color 
of  for  five  months. 

"Since  that  time  charge  accounts  have  been 
severely  taboo. 

"  I  allow  myself  an  allowance  of  one  hundred 
dollars  a  week.  And  I'm  as  strict  with  myself 
as  I  am  with  the  rest  of  the  family.  If  I  want

whim  and  I've  run  short  of  cash  I  wait  for  the 
next  week.     I  save  up  for  it. 

"  We're  both  careful  of  our  clothes.  Mildred 
has  a  mink  coat  she  bought  five  years  ago.  I 
looked  it  over  the  other  day  and  was  pleased  to 
find  that  it  is  in  just  as  good  condition  now  as 
it  was  when  it  was  bought. 

"There  is  a  dress  allowance  for  the  children, 
too.  They  must  keep  within  that  allowance  no 
matter  what  arises. 

"There  isn't  a  tree  on  the  place  that  I 
haven't  shopped  for.  When  we  were  putting 
in  the  olive  trees  I  found  that  one  pays  one 
hundred  dollars  for  a  tree  with  a  guarantee  and 
fifty  dollars  for  a  tree  without  a  guarantee.  I 
bought  one  of  each  and  I  watched  'em.  I  found 
that  the  fifty  dollar  tree  did  fully  as  well  as  the 
hundred  dollar  tree  and  the  rest  of  them  were 
bought  at  fifty  dollars  per  tree. 

OUTSIDE  of  the  house  itself  and  the  neces- 
sary cost  of  maintaining  it,  we  have  no  per- 
sonal extravagances. 

"We  do  not  maintain  poloponies,  for  instance. 
We  do  not  keep  a  yacht.  We  do  not  have 
apartments  in  New  York,  or  London,  or  even 
in  Los  Angeles.  We  have  no  villa  in  Cannes. 
We  do  not  go  in  for  gambling. 

"When  I  go  to  Caliente,  which  I  do  very 
seldom,  I  allow  myself  sixty  dollars  to  play 
with.    If  I  lose  that  I  stop. 

"We  do  not  have  large  liquor  bills.  I  never 
take  a  drink  myself  and  our  parties  are  apt  to 
be  small  and,  in  the  Hollywood  sense,  I  guess, 
comparatively  non-alcoholic. 

"Last  New  Year's  Eve,  for  instance,  we  gave 
a  small  party.  We  were  much  more  interested 
in  the  favors  Mid  bought  at  the  Five  and  Ten 
— the  paper  caps  and  snappers  and  tin  horns — 
than  we  were  in  the  kind  of  cocktails  we  would 
serve,  if  any. 

"I'm  crazy  about  penny  candy.  Mid 
doesn't  eat  candy.  The  only  candy  we  go  in 
for,  as  a  result,  are  penny  dreadfuls  and  licorice 
shoe-strings  and  those  fat  chocolate  bananas 
sprinkled  with  pink  poison,  probably. 

"We  have  a  beach  house,  now,  at  Santa 
Monica.  It's  cheaper  than  taking  the  family  to 
the  shore  in  summer.  It's  small  and  eco- 
nomical to  run. 

"And  while  we  are  away,  we  put  the  staff  on 
a  five-day  time  schedule. 

"The  children  are  taught  to  give  some  of 
their  toys  away  to  other  children.  And  they 
can't  give  only  the  old,  broken  toys,  either. 
They  can't  give  just  the  things  they  don't  want 
themselves.  When  they  make  up  the  boxes  to 
go  off,  some  sacrifice  must  be  involved. 

"They  are  taught,  too,  to  cook  and  sew  and 
clean  and  make  beds.  They  cannot  have  what- 
ever they  happen  to  fancy  at  any  time  they 
fancy  it. 

"When  they  go  shopping  and  see  some  special 
toy  they  think  they  would  like  to  have  they  are 
told  that  they  must  wait  for  it — wait  for  a 
birthday  or  for  Christmas  or  Easter  or  some 
gift-giving  holiday. 

"I  want  my  boy  to  go  to  public  school.  I 
wanted  the  girls  to  go  there,  too,  and  stuck  out 
for  it  until  Mildred  and  her  mother  convinced 
me  that,  in  public  schools,  the  other  children 
are  more  apt  to  cater  to  and  make  much  of 
those  who  have  more  than  they." 


"Kyf  ILDRED  and  Harold  have  done  a  great 
-*■  *-Mhing.  They  have  made  money  human. 
They  could  have  created  an  atmosphere  of 
frigid  formality  with  the  little,  heartening 
things  of  life  smothered  under.  They  could  so 
easily  have  given  everything  around  them  the 
chill  touch  of  Midas.  Instead  of  which,  they 
have  given  everything  about  them  the  warm 
touch  of  a  mother  and  a  father.  They  have 
created  an  atmosphere  of  tin  toys  and  penny 
candy  and  Easter  eggs  and  fun — of  children's 
wholesome,  unspoiled  laughter — of  a  place 
where  other  children  love  to  go — and  I  love  to 
go — and  you  would  love  to  go — and  you — and 
you —

A  part  of  the  gay  crowd  who  came  to  Herbert  Brenon's  tennis  party. 
The  grand  part  about  tennis  is  that  everyone  is  amused,  both  the 
people  who  play  and  those  who  watch.  Look  closely  at  this  photo  and 
you'll  spot  Tom  Mix,  Nils  Asther,  Vivian  Duncan  and  Mr.  and  Mrs. 
Chester  Morris.  Nobody  knew  that  the  picture  was  being  taken. 
This  was  one  of  the  biggest  social  events  of  the  Hollywood  season 


Let's  Have  a  Hollywood  Party 


CONTINUED  FROM  PACT.  67  | 


for  a  buffet  breakfast.  Then  off  they  started, 
each  on  his  mount.  At  noon  they  arrived  at  a 
spot  along  the  sea  where  a  lunch,  all  prepared, 
was  waiting.  And  did  they  impolitely  shoulder 
one  another  aside  for  those  sandwiches  and  that 
salad? 

They  ate  so  much,  no  one  could  even  mount 
his  horse  for  hours.  Then  straight  into  the 
moonlight  they  rode  and  at  a  secluded  little 
inn,  dinner  awaited. 

There  was  dancing  (for  those  who  could  still 
move)  to  the  radio,  bridge,  games,  and  back 
home  again  in  waiting  cars. 

BUT  the  most  astonishing  thing  about  the 
sophisticates  of  the  screen,  such  as  Ruth 
Chatterton,  Constance  Bennett  and  Norma 
Shearer,  is  their  love  of  games.  Just  plain 
games  you  played  as  a  child.  Hollywood  is 
wild  about  them. 

For  instance,  Connie  Bennett  will  give  a 
formal  but  delightful  dinner  (and  you'd  be  sur- 
prised at  the  simplicity  of  Connie's  menu)  and 
the  guests  will  arise  from  the  tables  and  make 
one  mad  ungentlemanly  and  unladylike  leap 
for  the  jigsaw  puzzles.  You  know  the  kind. 
All  cut  up  in  little  pieces.  And  there  they'll 
sit.  For  hours  on  end.  Putting  together  little 
pieces  of  cardboard. 

Well,  dissipated  Hollywood.    Dear  me. 

And,  by  the  way.  what  are  you  and  Jack 
planning  to  do  about  that  empty  basement? 
Nothing?  Nonsense.  You  should  see  what 
Hollywood  does  with  theirs.  Furnaces  are 
camouflaged.  Bright  rugs,  or  those  lovely  new 
linoleum  rugs,  cover  the  floor.  Card  tables 
set  about,  and  lo  and  behold,  here's  your  play- 
room. 

Hebe  Daniels  has  grand  parties  in  her  base- 
ment.    It's  all  decorated  like  a  ship,  with  all 


sorts  of  nautical  atmosphere.  Why  don't  you 
try  that  scheme,  too?  Sea  pictures,  life  pre- 
servers, ship  masts  and  what  not. 
__  Bebe  had  a  grand  cloudy-day  part}-  recent ly. 
You  see  we.  in  California,  merely  call  it  "high 
fog''  when  anywhere  else  in  the  world  it  would 
frankly  and  unashamedly  be  known  as  rain. 
But  we're  touchy  about  it.  And  Bebe  ga 
grand  "High  Fog''  Party.  Down  in  her  yacht- 
going  basement. 

Card  tables  were  set  up  and  dinner  served 
on  the  tables  and.  heave  ho,  sailor,  it  was  chop 
suey  and  plump  little  frankfurters.  And  did 
they  eat? 

As  a  matter  of  fact,  three  guests  fell  over- 
board and  darned  near  drowned. 

One  little  dish  like  this,  with  salad  and  ice, 
can  very  often  overshadow  an  elaborate  ten- 
course  dinner.    Try  it  and  see. 

After  dinner,  the  tables  were  cleared  and 
again  everyone  did  jigsaw  puzzles.  Very  small 
puzzles  had  one  worker  frantically  hunting 
about  for  parts.  Medium-sized  puzzles  had 
three  and  even  four  jigsawers.  while  huge  ones 
had  six  or  eight  people.  And  the  fun  of  it  is, 
no  one  has  the  slightest  idea  what  the  com- 
pleted picture  will  be.  They  may  be  hunting 
wildly  for  a  cow's  tail  when  all  the  tin* 
scene  is  a  cottage  by  the  sea.  Whoever  com- 
pletes his  puzzle  first  gets  the  prize.  A  prize 
each  for  the  small,  for  the  medium  and  for  the 
huge  ones.    It's  just  grand. 

"L_TOW  about  an  ice-box  party?  The  kind 
•*■  -^-Sylvia  Sidney  has.  Are  they  fun?  Sylvia 
takes  her  guests  to  a  show  or  concert.  Often 
as  not,  a  movie.  Then  everyone  rushes  home 
to  make  a  mad  dash  for  Sylvia' s  ice-box  and 
the  party's  on. 

There  are  platters  of  ham.  salami,  cheese,

cold  chicken,  everything  for  sandwiches.  A 
bowl  of  salad  is  found;  olives,  celery,  deviled 
eggs.  Sliced  buttered  bread  is  found  in  the 
bread  box.  The  coffee  percolator  gets  gay.  Ice 
cubes  clink  in  the  ginger  ale  (behave  yourself) 
and  the  kitchen  is  a  turmoil.  And  you'd  be 
surprised  at  the  swanky  people  who  just  love 
to  mess  about  kitchens.    Try  it  sometime. 

THE  Fredric  Marches  give  those  absolutely 
correct  dinners.  Everything  just  so.  The 
food  elegant.  The  appointments  exquisite. 
Mrs.  March  (Florence  Eldridge)  writes  the 
menus  and  will  shop  about  in  the  Mexican  quar- 
ter for  imported  cans  of  spicy  delicacies. 

Their  table  is  a  picture,  with  its  lovely  lace 
runner  and  pure  white  decorations.  The  very- 
last  word.  The  glassware  is  the  lovely  new 
milk-glass.  Plain,  with  initials  carved  on  the 
stems  (brand  new  idea).  Instead  of  a  center 
flower  bowl,  two  lovely  white  cornucopias  filled 
with  white  iris  adorn  the  center  of  the  table. 
White  candles  burn  in  white  candlesticks.  Tiny 
individual  white  china  ash-tray  and  match  sets 
are  at  each  place. 

Mrs.  March  has  solved  perfectly  the  fish  and 
salad  course  problem  by  cleverly  combining 
the  two. 

A  large  fish  mold  is  used.  Jello,  packed  with 
flaked  tuna  or  salmon,  is  poured  into  the  mold. 
The  elegant  looking  fish  is  brought  to  the  table 
and  served.  With  French  dressing,  it's  deli- 
cious. And  here's  a  thought,  hostess.  Why 
not  individual  jello  fishes  for  that  bridge  party? 
With  tiny  sandwiches  or  crackers,  here's  your 
lunch.    You're  welcome. 

Like  Ruth  Chatterton,  the  Marches  choose 
guests  who  have  mutual  interests.  Perhaps  at 
one  dinner  it  will  be  the  music-loving  crowd; 
the  next  dote  on  pictures  and  the  next  go  in  for 
polo  and  sports.    It  always  works. 

Miss  Chatterton  usually  gives  a  buffet  din- 
ner, with  simple  food  correctly  served.  After 
dinner  come  "anagrams"  and  "murder. "■  In 
playing  "murder"  a  certain  guest  is  chosen  to 
be  killed.  And  here's  a  grand  chance  to  kill 
outright  that  gurgling  Mrs.  Smith  that  out- 
talked  everyone  at  dinner,  or  that  annoying 
Mr.  Brown  who  goes  about  trying  to  hold  all 
the  ladies'  hands.  Either  could  be  murdered 
cheerfully  and  are  much  more  attractive  dead 
than  alive. 

All  right,  now  choose  a  guest  to  be  the  dis- 
trict attorney  and,  with  every  other  guest  a 
suspect,  the  game  is  on.  Each  one  tries  to  alibi 
or  pass  the  grief  on  to  the  next  one  until  finally 
one  poor  victim  becomes  so  hopelessly  en- 
tangled, he  actually  confesses  and  begs  for  jail. 
You  should  see  the  elegant  Miss  Chatterton  at 
this  game! 

And  if  you  have  any  distorted  ideas  that  a 
Chatterton  party  is  a  long,  broad  "a"  discus- 
sion on  art  in  the  fifteenth  century  (not  that 
Ruthie  couldn't  give  it  a  twirl  if  she  wanted) 
you're  mistaken. 

Play,  play  and  more  play  is  the  keynote  of 
every  Hollywood  party. 

T__TOW  about  a  formal  tea?  Norma  Shearer 
■*■  -Ogives  teas  that  are  famous,  with  all  the 
visiting  celebrities  in  full  bloom.  Congenial 
little  groups  gather  together.  There  is  usually 
music  or  a  psychoanalyst  to  amuse  the  guests. 
Or  an  outdoor  formal  tea  is  ideal.  How  about 
that  lovely  garden  you  worked  over  all  summer 
long?    Let's  show  it  off. 

Helen  Twelvetrees  had  an  outdoor  tea  re- 
cently that  was  perfect.  The  long  tea  table 
was  set  on  the  shady  back  porch.  Beach  um- 
brellas and  chairs  were  spotted  about  the  gar- 
den. The  women's  gay  summer  frocks  and  the 
men  in  flannels  made  a  pretty  picture.  Inside, 
a  tiny  bar  did  a  rushing  business  (lemonade's 
nice,  too).  Groups  of  people  were  playing  cro- 
quet on  the  front  lawn,  checker  games  were  in 
progress  under  the  old  elm  tree  and  the  younger 
set  were  battling  away  on  the  tennis  courts. 

Miriam  Hopkins  is  another  who  loves  to  en- 
tertain in  her  garden.  Four  o'clock  Sunday 
suppers  outdoors  are  Miriam's  specialty,  with 
huge  platters  of  fried  chicken  and  hot  biscuit

HOW  TO  REMOVE  THEM

on  each  card  table.  A  colored  three-piece  or- 
chestra lends  a  lot  of  atmosphere. 

Joan  Crawford  is  the  thoughtful  hostess. 
Joan  recently  gave  a  diet  party  for  a  few  close 
friends — a  clever  idea,  I  must  say.  Realizing 
only  too  well  the  necessity  for  careful  diet 
among  her  friends,  as  well  as  herself,  Joan  se- 
cretly consulted  the  cook  of  each  of  her  guests 
and  when  luncheon  was  called,  each  one  was 
served,  with  party  trimming  of  course,  exactly 
the  things  she  was  permitted  to  eat.  And 
everyone  ate  to  her  heart's  content  and  was 
spared  the  suffering  of  remorse. 

If  you  want  to  have  a  party  away  from  home, 
you'd  be  suqjrised  at  the  clever  touches  one 
can  give  a  party  at  the  club  house  or  in  a  hotel 
private  dining-room.  Sally  Eilers  gave  a  party 
for  Bebe  Daniels  at  the  Beverly  Wilshire  Hotel 
that  was  much  smarter  than  many  a  home 
party. 

The  color  scheme,  for  instance,  was  yellow 
and  chartreuse.  Flowers,  cloth,  candles  and 
dishes  were  all  in  this  striking  and  unusual, 
combination. 

And  Bebe  brought  that  adorable  baby  of 
hers  and  there  little  Barbara  Bebe  sat,  like  a 
miniature  hostess,  at  the  head  of  the  table. 
She  was  the  center  of  attraction,  with  every- 
one crowding  about  her. 

In  fact,  Sally's  luncheon  of  fruit  cocktail  in 
cantaloupe,  squab  and  asparagus  waited  while 
famous  movie  stars  gurgled  over  a  baby. 


Maybe  you  long  to  give  a  different  sort  of  tea. 
Yes,  it  can  be  done.  Louise  Closser  Hale, 
about  the  grandest  character  actress  in  Holly- 
wood, did. 

And  here's  how.  Small  separate  tables  with 
a  hostess  at  each  table,  instead  of  one  large 
table.  In  the  living-room,  a  table  with  tea 
and  hors  d'ceuvres  could  be  found. 

In  the  dining-room,  one  with  coffee  and 
sandwiches.  On  the  porch,  one  with  nuts  and 
cocktails. 

Now  is  that  an  idea?  That  way,  everyone 
keeps  moving  about  instead  of  the  usual 
congestion  in  one  room. 

CVEN  Hollywood  bachelors  give  grand  par- 
ities and  Gary  Cooper's  will  be  remembered 
a  long  time.  Mary  Pickiord  planned  the  menu 
and  the  appointments.  The  guests  sat  at  small 
tables  in  the  living-room,  which  was  cleared 
for  dancing  afterward. 

Upstairs,  card  games  were  in  progress  and 
the  inevitable  fortune  teller  held  forth  in 
another  room. 

But  Toluca,  Gary's  pet  chimpanzee  from 
Africa,  created  more  excitement  than  the  for- 
tune teller.    Which  is  strange,  for  Hollywood. 

So  you  see,  this  Hollywood  really  knows  its 
parties.  It  has  achieved  the  thing  sought  after 
by  every  frantic  hostess — a  knowledge  that 
everything  has  been  properly  served  and  every- 
one is  having  a  grand,  good  time. 


Mad,  Merry  Malibu

purchased.  A  year  later  came  fire  number  two 
and,  while  the  fire  engine  snorted  in  all  its  red 
painted  glory  up  and  down  Malibu's  back  road, 
seven  houses  burned  down.  There  was  no 
water. 

Fire  number  three,  one  year  later,  and  the 
hose  wouldn't  reach.  A  dampish  drizzle  played 
lightly  about  the  flames.  And  more  homes  bit 
the  dust. 

Malibu,  we  salute  you. 

And  while  fire  raged,  smoke  belched  and 
timbers  crashed,  a  real  estate  agent  stood  midst 
flame  and  smoke,  like  the  boy  on  the  burning 
deck,  and  sold  the  lot  next  door  to  an  eager 
customer.  While  cinders  fell  under  his  coat 
collar. 

He  bought  it,  I  tell  yon,  he  bought  it. 

Malibu — well,  I  can't  go  on. 

And  Leila  Hyams  found  two  collies,  four 
scotties,  a  police  dog,  four  children  and  one 
rabbit,  slightly  scorched,  piled  into  her  front 
bedroom  by  frantic  owners.  Two  days  later 
all  was  safely  disposed  of  but  the  rabbit.  Xo 
one  ever  came  to  claim  it. 

Week  nights  are  comparatively  quiet,  except 
for  Bert  Wheeler's  visitors  and  assorted  sizes 
of  Marx  Brothers.  But  come  Saturday  night 
and  tired  out  picture  stars  race  home  from  the 
studios  to  get  "away  from  it  all"  and  find 
themselves  attending  a  beach  version  of  the 
Mayfair.  Swanky  parties.  Swanky  food.  Satin 
slippers  full  of  sand.  Crashing  one  another's 
parties.  Behaving  as  they  never  dreamed  of 
in  Beverly  Hills. 

Breakfast  along  the  gray  white  way  is  usually 
at  eleven.  Sandwiches  in  the  patio  (what,  you 
didn't  know  about  the  patios?)  at  two,  and 
buffet  dinner  from  seven  Friday  night  until 
ten  Tuesday  morning. 

CLIQUES  are  formed.  There's  the  handball, 
tennis-playing  clique  who  haven't  seen  the 
ocean  for  years  and  years.  They  have  a  vague 
idea  that  it's  there.  When  it  grows  dark,  they 
merely  turn  on  one  of  the  many  searchlights 
that  adorn  the  front  of  many  homes  and  the 
game  continues. 

Then  there's  the  fishing  clique.  Buster  Col- 
lier, Arline  Judge,  Wesley  Ruggles,  Leila  Hy- 
ams and  others  who  hire  boats  to  go  far  out  on 
the  briny  deep. 


While  the  wives  and  husbands  who  didn't 
go  fishing  stay  home  and  form  the  bridge-play- 
ing clique.    Is  that  a  laugh  or  not? 

Then  there's  the  "simply  ravishing,  my 
deah"  clique  that  comprise  all  visiting  celebri- 
ties and  visit  weekly  with  Lil  Tashman.  Such 
delightful  parties,  my  dear. 

And  the  yacht-cruising  clique,  who  anchor 
offshore  and  wave  madly  to  those  on  shore 
who  wave  madly  back  to  those  offshore — I 
mean. 

How'd  I  get  on  this  yacht  anyhow?  The 
yacht-wavers  comprise  the  Richard  Arlens,  the 
Charlie  Farrells,  the  Richard  Barthelmess' 
and  others. 

■"THEN  there  are  people  who  actually  go  in 
-*■  the  water.  I  mean  beyond  the  first  wave. 
They  get  wet.  And  love  it.  Betty  Brent  is 
the  champion  get-wetter. 

Why,  even  the  servants  clique.  The  Spanish 
fronts  won't  associate  with  the  frame  huts  and 
the  Swiss  chaleters  don't  even  see  the  mere 
cottagers.    Nix. 

There  are  those  who  have  cliqued  themselves 
clear  out  of  Malibu.  Just  as  Man'  and  Doug 
pioneered  themselves  out  of  Hollywood  into 
Beverly  Hills,  so  have  some  gotten  too  ultra 
for  Malibu. 

There  are  just  two  places  for  them  to  go. 
Above  or  below  the  potteries.  My  yes,  there's 
a  pottery.  Must  have  our  little  local  industry, 
you  know. 

So  we  have  above-the-potteries-Malibuites 
and  below-the-potteries-Malibuites.  Both  are 
nice. 

A  star's  career  may  be  watched  in  this  fash- 
ion. From  Malibu  to  above  the  potteries. 
Promising.  To  below  the  potteries.  He's  ar- 
rived. 

Casting  for  pictures  has  been  known  to  take 
place  on  the  sands  in  a  very  large  way.  For 
instance,  Estelle  Taylor  was  having  a  snooze 
on  the  beach  when  she  was  awakened  by  a 
click-click-click.  She  opened  her  eyes  to  see 
Wesley  Ruggles,  the  director,  snapping  pic- 
tures of  her  luscious  form.  The  next  day  the 
test  was  shown  at  the  studio  and  won  for  Es- 
telle her  grand  part  in  "Cimarron."  Where 
she  wore  long  panties,  seven  petticoats  and  a 
satin  basque.

Too,  a  man  never  knows  from  year  to  year 
whether  the  interior  of  his  home  will  be  Queen 
Anne  or  Louis  the  Fourteenth.  It  depends  on 
the  wife.  One  wife  may  like  Anne  but  next 
year  the  new  wife  favors  Louis.  Or  Chinese 
Buddhas.  With  plenty  of  incense.  The  third 
year  his  even  newer  wife  may  prefer  early 
Harper's  Bazaar  and  think  she's  on  the  Medi- 
terranean. 

And  nothing;  will  prevent  her  from  going 
Riviera.     Nothing. 

Some  go  in  for  interior  decorations  with  in- 
ferior decorators.  Where  every  little  doodad 
has  a  meaning  all  its  own.  Others  get  a  great 
kick  out  of  furnishing  their  own.  It's  not  un- 
usual to  have  a  famous  head  suddenly  thrust 
itself  out  of  an  upstairs  window  and  scream, 
"Quick,  I've  just  finished  my  bathroom  cur- 
tains.    Come  quickly. " 

And  the  Keystone  cops  fade  completely  out 
of  memory's  picture  as  an  entire  colony  race 
wildly  to  see  the  simply  adorable  accordion 
pleated,  crepe  chiffon,  hand-embroidered  bath- 
room curtains.    That  cute,  they  are. 

BUT  Connie  Bennett  combines  interior  decor- 
ation with  common  sense.  William  Haines, 
who  has  a  terrific  flair  for  knowing  what's  right 
in  a  home,  has  done  Connie's  beach  home. 
Smart  simplicity  is  the  keynote  with  red  buck- 
ram lampshades. 

Just  plan  red  buckram.  While  Fay  Wray's 
are  plan  white  silk. 

Louise  Fazenda  claims  her  new  house  is  a 
late  Fazenda  model.  The  bed  may  not  be  a 
gem  of  art  but  the  mattress  is  swell.  The  cur- 
tains may  not  be  anything  to  write  to  Congress 
about,  but  they're  sunfast. 

There  is  also  the  comical  situation  of  waking 
up  one  morning  and  smelling  the  bacon  frying 
for  one's  bitterest  enemy,  next  door.  Who  has 
moved  in  overnight. 

And  that  has  been  known  to  happen  in  the 
land  of  fueds  and  fever. 

And  there's  the  store.  The  good  old  general 
store  across  the  highway.  That  might,  from 
a  bird's-eye  view  of  the  outside,  be  the  general 
store  of  Si  Perkins'  over  at  Pumpkin  Center, 
by  gosh.  And  at  that,  it  might  be  on  the  inside, 
too,  with  its  queer  little  vegetable  stalls  and 
painted  blue  shelves.  But  on  those  shelves, 
brother  and  sister,  on  those  shelves.  It  would 
pop  the  eyes  of  Mrs.  Van  Astor  herself.  What 
a  store  this  has  turned  out  to  be.  Gleaming 
jars  of  stuffed  mangoes,  in  vinegar.  Little 
blue  snails  with  a  Chevalier  accent  all  over  the 
bottle.  Artichoke  hearts  in  sherry.  Walnut 
catsup.  And  try  that  on  your  baked  beans 
sometime.  Stuffed  oranges  and  pineapple  in 
grenadine.     Bottles  of  cr£me  de  menthe. 

And  on  those  rickety  vegetable  stands.  Well, 
name  anything  out  of  season  and  Mr.  Bills,  the 
owner  will  have  it.  You'll  find  raspberries  at 
the  Malibu  general  store  when  the  only  other 
raspberries  in  the  state  of  California  will  be  a 
loud,  hissing  noise. 

It's  the  prize  general  store  of  the  world.  The 
symbol  of  Hollywood.  Moved  a  bit  to  the 
north.  Where  famous  stars  gather  to  gossip, 
shop,  and  take  turns  at  the  telephone. 

"K^ALIBU.  For  eight  years  more  it  will 
■'■"•'-carry  on  the  glamorous  traditions  of  a 
motion  picture  colony.  Then  the  leases  will  be 
up. 

Where  Jack  Gilbert  races  out  of  his  house 
every  morning,  bosom  bared  to  the  sweeping 
winds,  head  flung  back,  to  the  water's  edge, 
glancing  quickly  up  and  down  and  if  no  one's 
looking,  wetting  one  large  toe  on  the  right  foot 
and  rushing  back. 

Where  parties  get  bigger  and  waves  dash 
higher.  Where  in  eight  more  years  a  lady  will 
step  down  from  a  stone  mansion  on  an  over- 
looking hill  and  say,  "Amscray. "  And  the 
great  conflagration  of  1940  begins. 

When  the  gay,  mad  spirit,  that  will  never  die 
as  long  as  pictures  are  made,  will  go  right  on 
and  take  itself  somewhere  else. 

From  Hollywood  to  Malibu. 

From  Malibu  to  Somewhere  Else. 

The  stars  cannot  stand  still  in  their  courses.

U  Sue,  I'm  thrilled!  I  just  got 
back  from  the  grocer's.  It  was 
crowded  —  stacks  of  women 
buying — guess  what?  Ivory 
Soap!  Did  you  know  how  much 
Ivory  prices  have  been  reduced?  7? 


IVORY  SOAP 
now  at  the 

Lowest  Prices 
in  17  Years 


ii  Why,  Molly,  didn't  you  know? 
Everybody's  been  talking  about 
the  new  Ivory  prices  for  days. 
Yesterday  at  the  club  we  all 
agreed  they  were  so  low  we 
could  use  Ivory  for  everything.  J  7 


Everywhere  Ivory  users — old 
and  new — are  saying  by  the 
millions,  "At  these  new  low 
prices  Ivory  is  the  only  soap  I 
need  for  everything: 

face  and  hands 

baby's  bath 
family's  baths 

shampooing 

silks,  woolens— nice 
cottons  and  linens 

dishwashing  (to 
protect  hands) 

and  every  other  soap  purpose 
about  the  home."

[CON!  l\l  ED  FROM  PAGE  54  1 


MADAME  RACKETEER— Paramount 

II    you've  longed  to  sec  Alison  Skipworth  do 
more    than   just   a   supporting    role — here's 
your  chance.    Literally,  as  the  grand  old  crook 

who  poses  as  a  countess,  she-  is  the  star,  and 
not  even  the  presence  of  George  Raft  and 
Richard  Bennett,  good  as  they  are,  can  rob  her 
of  it.  The  entire  picture  is  grand.  See  it  and 
have  yourself  one  fine  chuckle. 

UNASHAMED— M-G-M 

LEWIS  STONE  can  save  almost  any  picture 
from  the  doldrums,  and  he  almost  manages 
i.i  save  this  one.  But,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that 
the  story  is  based  on  an  actual  occurrence — re- 
member those  front  page  stories  about  the 
wealthy  boy  who  shot  his  sister's  sweetheart? — 
it  is  pretty  unbelievable.  Helen  Twelvetrees 
and  Robert  Young  are  the  brother  and  sister. 

THE  PURCHASE  PRICE— Warners 

A  Sa  singer  in  a  night  club,  Barbara  Stan- 
-**-wyck,  in  order  to  escape  the  attentions  of 
the  boy  friend,  takes  herself  off  to  marry  a 
Western  farmer,  sight  unseen.  Much  time  is 
taken  up  with  Barbara's  life  on  the  farm,  get- 
ting nowhere.  Stanwyck,  as  usual,  is  real  and 
sincere,  but  George  Brent  seems  slightly  mis- 
cast as  the  North  Dakota  farmer  with  the 
sniffles.     Rather  dull  and  uninspired. 

THE  OLD  DARK  HOUSE— Universal 

T_TERE'S  another  horror  thing  that  will  make 
*■  -*-you  shiver.  A  group  of  travelers,  includ- 
ing Melvyn  Douglas  and  Lilian  Bond,  caught 
in  a  terrific  mountain  rainstorm,  are  forced  to 
seek  shelter  in  a  house  inhabited  by  mad 
people.  Not  much  story,  but  the  characters 
are  excellent,  particularly  Boris  Karloff  and 
Eva  Moore.    Grand  camera  work. 

PACK  UP  YOUR  TROUBLES— M-G-M- 
Hal  Roach 

A  \'D  you'll  do  it.  You'll  pack  up  those  blues 
■*  *-and  laugh  yourself  pink.  For  here  come 
Laurel  and  Hardy  in  a  full  length  comed\r,  and 
what  a  comedy.  As  two  bench-warmers.  Stan 
and  Ollie  are  mildly  surprised  to  find  them- 
selves in  the  army.  A  riot  in  the  trenches! 
Jacquie  Lyn.  the  child,  grabs  oft"  a  handful  of 
the  glory  for  herself.  If  you're  blue,  run,  don't 
walk,  to  see  Stan  and  Ollie.    You'll  feel  better! 

GOONA-GOONA— First  Division 

DON'T  pass  this  by  because  you  think  it  is 
another  travelog.  It  is  a  charming  love 
Story  taken  from  a  legend  in  the  island  of  Bali. 
Natives  are  the  actors  and  the  scenery  is  su- 
perb. Wyan,  the  native  lover,  looks  like  the 
Tcir.uii  of  Bali!  And  little  Dasnee,  the  heroine, 
is  exquisite.     Entertaining  and  different. 

MY  PAL,  THE  KING— Universal 

"Y"(HT  may  think  you  have  seen  Tom  Mix  do 
•*■  all  his  stunts,  but  you  haven't  seen  any- 
thing until  you  see  him  and  his  Wild  West 
Show  engage  in  a  battle-royal  with  nothing  but 
tent  stakes  for  weapons.  Only  Tom  or  Will 
Rogers  could  make  this  seem  logical.  Mickey 
Rooney.  as  the  young  king,  is  grand.  Lots  of 
fun  for  everybody. 

AREN'T  WE  ALL?— 
Paramount -British  Prod. 

T—TF.RL'S  a  nice  little  comedy — very  British, 
-*-  -"-very  talkie,  but  with  a  certain  amount  of 
charm.     Gertrude   Lawrence  does  not  photo- 


graph as  beautiful  as  she  appears  upon  the 
stage,  but  she  does,  nevertheless,  have  glamour 
in  this  frothy  Lonsdale  play,  which  concerns  a 
young  married  couple  and  their  first  misunder- 
standings. 

WHITE  ZOMBIE— United  Artists 

TV  you're  just  a  fiend  for  horror  pictures  you'll 
■'■take  this  and  like  it,  but  if  weird  screams  and 
tom-toms  don't  make  your  blood  curdle  any 
more,  you'll  find  this  just  a  little  funny.  It 
concerns  the  half-dead  who  rise  from  their 
graves.  They  are  known  as  zombies  to  the 
natives.  Madge  Bellamy  returns — not  so 
good  in  talkies  as  silents.  Bela  Lugosi  is  his 
old  Dracula  self. 

MYSTERY  RANCH— Fox 

TUST  an  average  Western,  with  the  scenery 
and  locations  playing  the  starring  role.    They 
tried  to  throw  in  a  little  mystery,  but  the  idea 


William  A.  Fraker 

Not  so  long  ago  the  executives  over 
at  the  Columbia  Studios  were  jump- 
ing up  and  down  on  their  best  hats. 
Reason?  They  just  couldn't  make  up 
their  minds  about  who  should  have 
the  leading  role  in  "The  Bitter  Tea 
of  General  Yen."  Then  somebody 
had  an  idea,  and  a  projection-roomful 
of  stenographers  looked  at  all  the 
tests  that  had  been  made.  They 
chose  Nils  Asther.  Do  you  like  the 
make-up?  Incidentally,  some  wag 
suggested  that  a  better  title  would  be 
"The   Bitter  Yen    of    General   Tea" 


didn't  quite  come  off.  George  O'Brien,  stal- 
wart as  usual,  Cecelia  Parker,  properly  demure 
— and  oh  my,  such  mean  villains! 

THE  STOKER— First  Division-Allied 

nrHIS  is  a  jumble  about  a  man,  forced  out  of 
■*-  business  by  the  moneyed  powers,  who  be- 
comes a  stoker  on  a  ship  bound  for  South 
America,  only  to  land  on  a  plantation  owned 
by  a  beautiful  senorita.  It  has  a  little  of  every- 
thing in  it — even  to  the  American  Marines. 
who  are  brought  in  to  chase  the  bandits.  Monte 
Blue  is  the  hero  and  Dorothy  Burgess,  the 
lovely  senorita,  with  Noah  Beery  the  bold  ban- 
dit. 


DANGERS  OF  THE  ARCTIC— 
Explorers'  Film  Prod. 

TF  you're  a  rabid  travelog  fan,  you'll  want  to 
*add  this  to  your  collection.  It  is  done  in  the 
usual  manner,  with  a  boat  Alaska-bound  and 
the  cameraman  digging  out  secrets  about  the 
lives  of  the  Eskimos. 

SCHUBERT'S  DREAM  OF  SPRING— 

Capital  Film 

"CNGLISH  titles  help  interpret  the  action, 
-'—'but  Schubert's  music  is  so  entrancing  that, 
even  without  their  aid,  one  may  thoroughly 
enjoy  this  pleasant  little  operetta  of  old 
Vienna.  The  story  is  a  portrayal  of  the  com- 
poser's life,  and  his  famous  "Serenade''  is  the 
theme  song. 

THE    MAN    CALLED    BACK— Tiffany 

D  FMFMBER  that  old  plot  involving  a  well- 
-'-^-known  doctor  who  drank  too  much  and 
subsequently  fumbled  an  important  operation? 
He  goes  to  the  dogs  in  the  tropics,  too.  Here 
it  is  again,  all  dressed  up  with  a  murder  trial 
at  the  end.  An  impressive  group  of  old  favor- 
ites, including  Conrad  Xagel.  Doris  Kenyon, 
John  Halliday  and  Juliette  -Compton  going 
Garbo  in  a  black  wig,  make  this  interesting 
entertainment  despite  the  somewhat  hack- 
neyed plot. 

HELL  FIRE  AUSTIN— World  Wide 

•"THE  children  will  love  this  picture.  Every 
•*-  boy  who  has  thrilled  over  fashioning  a  lariat 
out  of  a  clothesline  will  lie  awake  nights  rid- 
ing again  with  Ken  Maynard  on  his  horse, 
Tarzan.  The  thinness  of  the  story  is  forgotten 
in  the  thrill  of  action. 

RIDE  HIM,  COWBOY— Warners 

A  GAIN  we  are  convinced  that  John  Wayne 
-*Mias  something  definite  to  offer  to  pictures, 
particularly  if  he  is  kept  in  Westerns  that  suit 
him  like  this.  It's  never  tiresome.  Otis  Har- 
lan and  Charles  Sellon  are  judges  that  amuse, 
while  Ruth  Hall  is  the  attractive  heroine. 

FORBIDDEN  COMPANY— Invincible 

T  ORETTA  YOUNG'S  sister.  Sally  Blane.  is 
-'-'building  more  slowly  than  did  Loretta.  but 
she  is  coming  along.  Here  she  is  an  artist's 
model  with  a  rich  young  man.  Johnny  Darrow, 
in  love  with  her.  And  does  he  run  into  parental 
objections!  Myrtle  Stedman,  slightly  plumper, 
is  the  rich  mother. 

LOVE  IN  HIGH  GEAR— 
Mayfair  Pictures 

AH,  the  pearls  are  stolen  again — the  most 
important  present  the  bride  received!  Im- 
agine her  embarrassment!  But  that  is  nothing 
compared  with  the  groom,  who  is  accused  of 
the  theft.  Alberta  Vaughn  and  Harrison  Ford 
sutler,  and  while  it's  made  for  laughter,  don't 
look  for  hilarious  comedy. 

THE  VANISHING  FRONTIER— 
Paramount 

SOMEWHERE  Johnny  Mack  Brown 
dropped  that  Alabama  accent  and  took  on 
a  quaint  Spanish  one.  The  story  deals  with 
early  California  and  Johnny's  a  big.  bold  hold- 
up man  of  the  West.  Unjustly  accused  of 
murder,  he  battles  soldiers,  escapes,  and  wins 
the  girl.  Plenty  of  hard  riding  and  swell  scen- 
ery.   You'll  like  Johnny.

LOSES 

27  Pounds 

„f  FAT 


Mrs.  Helen  Greene 

It's  important  to  health  and 
beauty  to  banish  fat  and  it's 
j  ust  as  vital  to  employ  the  proper 
means — a  safe,  sane  method 
which  won't  injure  health  and 
leave  you  haggard  looking. 

How  capably  a  half  teaspoon- 
ful  of  Kruschen  Salts  in  hot  water 
every  morning  fills  this  need! 

Kruschen  is  the  SAFE, 
HEALTHy  vay  to  reduce— it 
builds  up  splendid  health  all 
while  it  helps  restore  your  weight 
to  NORMAL. 

Notice  how  complexion  clears,  eyes 
grow  brighter  and  mind  keener — you'll 
be  delighted  when  your  scales  show  how 
quickly  excess  (at  is  disappearing.  Many 
folks  hasten  results  by  cutting  down  on 
fatty  meats,  pastries  and  potatoes. 

Mrs.  Helen  Greene  of  Brooklyn,  N.  Y. 
writes:  "A  physician  advised  my  mother 
to  take  Kruschen  Salts  for  overweight  so 
I  started  taking  it  myself.  I  weighed  792 
and  after  taking  3  bottles  I  reduced  to 
165  and  never  felt  so  well.  It's  a  tonic  as 
well  as  reducer". 

A  bottle  that  lasts  4  weeks  costs  but 
85  cents  at  any  drugstore — for  REAL 
results  and  your  health's  sake — refuse 
imitations — accept  nothing  but  Kruschen.

Screen    Memories    From    Photoplay 

15  Years  Ago 


Pearl 
White 


"DIFTEEN  years  ago  our 
*-  pages  recorded  the  ac- 
tivities of  the  three  great- 
est stars  of  that  day  — 
Mary  Pickford,  Douglas 
Fairbanks  and  Charlie- 
Chaplin,  and  the  magazine 
was  dotted  with  what  we 
now  call  "gag"  pictures  of 
little  Mary  making  funny 
faces,  clowning  in  an  old 
pony  cart  and  such  things.  A  few  years  later 
Mary  stopped  all  that  and  became  dignified. 
Hut  recently  she  has  again  changed  her  ways. 
A  few  weeks  ago  she  was  caught  posing  for  a 
"gag"  picture  in  the  Brown  Derby  restaurant. 
As  for  Chaplin — well,  we  had  a  grand  story 
about  him.  We  said,  "Chaplin  comedies  are 
not  made— they  occur."  We  wish  one  would 
occur  again. 

Come  on,  Charlie,  settle  down  there  in 
Hollywood  where  you  belong  and  make  a 
comedy  to  shake  us  with  laughter  and  tears — 
as  you  did  long  ago. 


Now,  here's  a  name  to  make  you  remember- 
A  story  about  Pearl  White  was  accompanied  by 
a  classy  picture — "classy"  was  the  word  then — 
of  her  in  a  limousine  that  had  cost  S14.000. 
Imagine!  Xow  Pearl  has  retired  and  lives  in 
France.  Wonder  if  she  ever  thinks  about  those 
serials  she  used  to  make,  "The  Perils  of 
Pauline,"  for  instance.   Whoops,  what  a  show! 

Mae  Marsh  was  the  wistful  little  girl  on  the 
cover,  while  the  gallery  included  Marjorie 
Rambeau,  Vernon  Steele,  Olga  Petrova,  J. 
Harney  Sherry,  Louise  Glaum,  Robert  Harron, 
June  Caprice  and  Ann  Pennington. 

Some  of  the  pictures  reviewed  were  Charles 
Ray  in  "The  Clodhopper,"  Mary  Pickford  in 
"The  Little  American,"  Charlie  Chaplin  in 
"The  Immigrant,"  Douglas  Fairbanks  in 
"Wild  and  Woolly"  and  Dorothy  Dalton  in 
"The  Flame  of  the  Yukon." 

Cal  York  item:  Wally  Reid  is  now  a  father. 
Hoth  daddy  Wally  and  mama  Dorothy  Daven- 
port are  proud  of  that  boy,  who  has  been 
named  Wally  Reid,  Jr.  (Now  young  Wally  is 
going  in  pictures  to  carry  on  the  famous  name.) 


10  Years  Ago 


Gloria 
Swanson 


GLORIA  SWAXSON 
has  just  returned  from 
Paris  with  trunkfuls  of 
amazing  clothes  which  our 
busy  photographer 
snapped  as  soon  as  they 
were  unpacked.  And  what 
clothes!  (Quick,  some- 
body, bring  the  smelling 
salts,  Seymour  has 
fainted!)  Fringe,  span- 
gles, aigrettes,  pearls,  feather  fans  and — yes, 
honest — she  carried  a  long  cane.  Don't  ever 
again  say  that  modern  togs  are  absurd!  But 
then,  as  now,  girls  all  over  the  country  were 
copying  movie  stars'  gowns. 

What  a  gay  little  story  we  printed — the  one 
about  Marie  Prevost,  in  which  we  pointed  out 
(and  ran  a  picture  to  prove  it)  that  Marie  had 
just  about  the  best  pair  of  legs  then  in 
Hollywood. 

How  were  we  to  know  that  Marlene  Dietrich 
was  coming  along  with  those  glorious  stems? 
And  that  Marie  was  to  look  too  long  upon 
French  pastry  and  chocolate  pie  and  lose  that 
gorgeous  figure? 


Wearing  pajamas  outside  a  bedroom  is  not 
a  modern  idea,  for  ten  years  ago  Rudolph 
Valentino's  wife,  Natacha  Rambova,  was  doing 
it — and  so  was  Rudy,  as  a  flock  of  at  home 
pictures  of  these  two  testify.  Incidentally, 
they  were  the  first  photographs  ever  taken  of 
Rudy  at  home. 

But  the  biggest  news  of  the  month  was  the 
fact  that  Norma  Talmadge  and  Eugene  O'Brien 
were  to  be  reunited  on  the  screen.  How  many 
hearts  these  two  have  thrilled  during  the  years 
of  cinema  history. 

Alice  Terry  graced  the  cover.  Claire 
Windsor,  Bebe  Daniels,  Helen  Ferguson, 
Colleen  Moore,  Rudolph  Valentino,  Anita 
Stewart  and  Lucille  Carlisle  were  the  gallery 
selections. 

Some  of  the  best  films  were  Jack  Holt  in 
"While  Satan  Sleeps,"  Corinne  Griffith  in 
"  Divorce  Coupons"  (she's  back  in  the  English- 
made  film,  "Lily  Christine"),  Wally  Reid  in 
"The  Dictator,"  Charlie  Ray  in  "Smudge," 
"The  Storm"  and  "If  You  Believe  It,  It's  So." 

Cal  York  item:  When  Mary  Hay  underwent 
an  operation  recently  her  husband,  Richard 
Barthelmess,  was  constantly  at  her  bedside. 


5  Years  Ago 


Eve 
Southern 


THIS  time  five  years  ago 
all  the  stars,  directors 
and  featured  players  were 
just  that  excited.  About 
what?  Guess!  Well,  the 
big  bosses  were  cutting 
everybody's  salary  ten  per 
cent.  The  old  world  does 
move  in  cycles,  doesn't  it? 
There  were  a  lot  of  mar- 
riages to  report,  the  most 
spectacular  being  Vilma  Hanky's  and  Rod 
LaRocque's.  Just  a  couple  of  months  ago  we 
told  you  that  they  are  still  very  happy.  But 
the  marriage  of  little  Renee  Adoree  to  William 
Gill,  which  we  also  chronicled,  was  destined  for 
the  rocks  and  Renee's  life  became  one  of  trials 
and  tribulations.  Now,  however,  after  two 
years  in  an  Arizona  sanitarium,  she  is  about 
well  again  and  ready  to  take  her  place  in 
pictures  that's  been  vacant  too  long. 

And  here  is  the  first  photograph  to  be  pub- 
lished of  Jaime  Del  Rio  with  his  glamorous 
wife,  Dolores.  At  that  time  Jaime  entertained 
thoughts  of  becoming  a  scenario  writer.     And 


then — but  you  know  that  long  and  tragic  story. 

Lupe  Velez  had  just  been  chosen  to  play 
opposite  Douglas  Fairbanks  in  "The  Gaucho," 
and  we  predicted  a  successful  career  for  Lupe, 
which  prophecy  she  has  fulfilled — and  how! 
Incidentally,  Eve  Southern  was  the  other  girl 
in  that  picture.  Remember  her?  She  had  the 
longest  eyelashes  (including  Garbo's)  in  Holly- 
wood. But  whereas  Lupe  clicked — you've 
heard  her  clicking  for  five  years-  Eve  didn't. 
Two  girls  with  an  equal  chance,  but  that's 
Hollywood. 

Lovely  May  Allison  was  on  the  cover,  and  in 
the  gallery  we  discover  Dolores  and  Helene 
Costello,  Joan  Crawford,  Rod  LaRocque, 
Ramon  Xovarro,  Esther  Ralston  and  Phyllis 
Haver. 

The  six  best  pictures  were  "Wings."  "Un- 
derworld," "The  Patent  Leather  Kid."  "The 
Magic  Flame,"  "The  Country  Doctor"  and 
"The  Loves  of  Carmen." 

Cal  York  items:  Constance  Talmadee  and 
Captain  Alastair  Mackintosh  are  getting  a 
divorce.  .  .  .  The  Greta  Garbo-Jack  Gilbert 
romance  is  once  again  in  full  swing.

ISABEL:  Honestly,  it 
spoils   my   game   looking 
at  my  "dishpan  hands"  — 


MONICA:  Mine  looked 
even  worse  when  I  was 
first  married. 

ISABEL:  I  can't  believe 
it — yours  are  so  exquisite 
now — so  smooth  and  white. 


MONICA:  Thanks, 
darling! — All  I  did  was  to 
use  Lux  for  my  dishes.  It's 
so  quick — and  positively 
miraculous  for  your  hands. 

WHAT  IF  YOU 
HAVEN'T  A  MAID 

DON'T  IMAGINE  that  women  with  ex- 
quisite hands  always  have  maids  to  do 
their  work. 

Nowadays  it's  much  more  likely  that 
they're  cooking  and  washing  dishes  them- 
selves. But  they  give  their  hands  a  very 
inexpensive,  marvelous  kind  of  beauty  care 
.  .  .  they  wash  dishes  with  Lux! 

While  the  tiny  Lux  diamonds  work 
speedily  to  leave  dishes  shining,  they  soothe 
and  treasure  your  hands. 

Ordinary  soaps  —  cakes,  powders  or 
chios  —  often  contain  harmful  alkali  that 
reddens  and  coarsens  hands.  Lux  has  no 
harmful  alkali.  That's  why  it  leaves  your 
hands  so  softly  white!

in  distress  Ken  Maynard  saves  the  situation  with 
gun  and  fist.    And  there  you  arel     (March)

service  for  all  the  family  to  see.  Ricardo  Cortez  is  a

crippled  girl  who  devotes  her  time  to  blind  children. 
(June)

7  arzan.     (April) 

TEMPEST — L'FA. — Emil  Jannings  fine  in  a  Ger-

TENDERFOOT,  THE— First  National— Joe  E. 
Brown  as  a  cowboy  from  Texas  hits  Broadway,  and

Mix  impersonates  a  desperado  to  trap  the  bandit 

(•-1  ug.)

(March) 

THEFT  OF  THE  MONA  LISA.  THE— Tobis. 

love  story  of  an  'talian  lad.  German  drama  with 
few  English  titles,  making  the  picture  lack  interesl 
for  those  who  do  not  understand  German.     (June)

Artclass.  —  A  dull  story  of  a  prize-fighter  and  a  nighl 
club  performer.  Regis  Toomey  and  Dorothy 
Sebastian.     (.1  ug.) 

•     THIS  IS  THE  NIGHT— Paramount— This 
a  light  and  farcical  interlude  that  movie  goers 
long   for.      Lily    Damita    is  charming   as   is    Thelma 
Todd.     Roland  Young  and  Charles  Ruggles  are  mar- 
velous comedians.     (June) 

THIS  RECKLESS  AGE— Paramount— In  spite 
of  a  grand  cast  (including  Richard  Bennett)  this  yarn 
came  too  late.     The  jazz  age  is  pretty  cold.    (March) 

THUNDER  BELOW  —  Paramount.  —  Tallulah

actress  rf  distinction.  Paul  Lukas,  Ralph  Forbes  and

A  fine  balance  of  drama  and  humor.  Joan 
Bennett  plays  a  lovely  prisoner  accused  of  murder. 
Donald  Cook,  her  attorney,  will  cause  a  flutter  among 
feminine  movie-goers.  But  the  laughs  go  to  ZaSu 
Pitts  and  Skeets  Gallagher.     (.June) 

TWO  FISTED  LAW— Columbia.— Tim  McCoy 
Western  in  which  another  villain  forecloses  the 
mortgage  on  the  old  ranch.    Hch-heh!     (Aug.) 

TWO  KINDS  OF  WOMEN— Paramount. — 
Miriam  Hopkins  is  in  it.  So  is  Phillips  Holmes.  The 
story  is  weak  but  the  acting  isn't.     (March) 

*TWO  SECONDS— First  National.— If  you 
don't  like  your  drama  full  measure,  don't  see 
this.  The  story  of  what  passes  through  a  man's  mind 
in  the  last  two  seconds  he  is  conscious  before  electro- 
cution. Edward  Robinson's  work  is  memorable  and 
the  beauty  of  Vivienne  Osborne  impressive.     (June) 

TWO  SOULS  (Zwei  MenscherO— Cicero  Prod- 
Heavy  drama  and  bright  spots  in  the  Tyrolese 
country  neatly  combined.  English  titles  make  it  un- 
derstandable to  those  who  don't  speak  German. 
(March)

THE— Sono  Art-World  Wide.— If  you're  a  football 
fan,  you  must  see  this  visual  account  of  one  of  the 
greatest  sports  events  of  all  time.     (March) 

VANITY  FAIR  — Allied  Pictures.  — They've 
dressed  Becky  Sharp  up  in  modern  clothes  and  made 
her  Myrna  Loy,  and  if  you  didn't  read  the  book 
you'll  enjoy  the  picture.     (May) 

WAYWARD  —  Paramount.  —  A  lot  of  plots 
wrapped  in  one  celluloid  package.  Nancy  Carroll, 
Richard  Arlen  and  Pauline  Frederick.     (April) 

WEEK-END  MARRIAGE— First  National- 
Wives,  it  seems  from  this,  shouldn't  work  and 
Loretta  Young  and  Norman  Foster  explain  it  all  in 
this  earnest  picture.      (Aug.) 

WEEK   ENDS   ONLY— Fox.— Not   new  in   plot. 

but  camouflaged  with  bright  tinsel.  Joan  Bennett 
does  well  as  a  rich  girl  made  poor  by  the  stock  market 
crash.      (Aug.) 

WESTWARD  PASSAGE  —  RKO-Pathe.  —  Ann 

Harding,  ZaSu  Pitts  and  Irving  Pichel.  The  story  is 
entertaining  enough  but  it  lacks  pep  and  punch.

being  the  "worst  kids  in  town."  Raymond  Borzage

lier, and  Spencer  Tracy  and  Ralph  Bellamy  do  grand 
work.      (June)

Wash  nasty 
handkerchiefs? 

Not  since  I 
learned  about 

KLEENEX" 

disposable    tissues 


WASHING  dirty  handkerchiefs  is 
a  most  repulsive  task— and  may  be 
dangerous  as  well,  if  handkerchiefs  are 
contaminated  with  cold  or  other  germs. 

Fortunately,  this  dreadful  task  is  no 
longer  necessary. 

Buy  a  package  of  Kleenex  and  say 
goodbyto  handkerchief  washing!  These 
soft  tissues  are  superior  to  handkerchiefs 
in  every  way— and  when  used,  you  simply 
destroy!  No  washing!  No  self-infection! 
No  laundry  bill— if  you  have  handker- 
chiefs washed  commercially. 

Kleenex  is  available  in  25c  rolls  (in 
pink  or  white):  as  well  as  in  the  con- 
venient pull-out  packages.  Try  the  large 
sizeKleenex  for  dust- 
ing, and  towels.  A

Photoplay  Magazine  for  September,  1932  i  i  7 

Enjoy  the    Benefits   of    Olive    Oil    and    Complete 

Color    Harmony    for    Your    Make-up    with    the    New 


shirt  with  collar  open,  scarf — no  tie.  His  hair 
was  always  careless. 

Imagine,  the  surprise  of  the  studio  folk  when, 
one  day  early  in  19M,  he  walked  across  the  lot 
in  a  smart,  new,  dark  blue  tailored  suit,  white 
shirt,  expensive  silk  tie!  "What's  happened  to 
Bobby?"  everyone  asked. 

He  looked  like  a  haberdashery  advertisement 
rather  than  the  lovable,  full-of-fun,  easy-man- 
nered Robert  Montgomery.  He  dropped  into 
an  office  and  made  his  own,  nervous,  unnatural 
explanation.  "This  is  Mrs.  Montgomery's 
little  boy's  big  chance.  I  am  going  to  play 
with  Garbo!  We  begin  rehearsals  today.  Do 
I  look  all  right?" 

He  was  as  different  looking,  as  nervous,  as 
unnatural  in  that  picture  as  he  was  on  that  first 
day  of  rehearsal.  His  entire  personality  under- 
went a  change  the  moment  he  discovered  he 
was  to  play  with  Garbo. 

T  INTERVIEWED  Bob  while  he  was  work- 
-*-  ing  on  "Inspiration."  He  offered  to  get  me 
onto  the  great  stage  to  watch  Garbo  work. 
When  I  refused,  he  was  astounded.  What — a 
writer  refusing  such  an  opportunity!  I  could 
not  have  used  any  information  gained  under 
those  arrangements.  He  trusted  me  that  much. 
I  did  not  try  to  explain  that  time  was  too  valu- 
able to  waste.  He  would  have  thought  me 
crazy  to  consider  that  any  time  watching 
Garbo  was  wasted! 

So  I  was  not  surprised  at  Bob's  flop  in  "In- 
spiration." I  knew  he  would  seem  unnatural 
on  the  screen. 

Clark  Gable's  story  is  the  same.  His  in- 
dividuality, his  dominant  virility,  faded  away 
in  the  presence  of  his  I-am-working-with- 
Garbo  complex.  Ditto  for  Melvyn  Douglas; 
Conrad  Nagel  had  always  been  a  bit  phleg-

matic;  his  personality  lias  never  been  so  de- 
rided "r  (lark's.  He  became  more 
phlegmatic  on  the  screen  with  Garbo. 

John  Gilbert,  Nils  Asther,  Gavin  Gordon 
and  Ramon  Xovarro  had  to  combat  the  added 
turbulence  of  personal  devotion. 

\  on  know  the  story  of  John.  Love  deliber- 
ately sac  rifices,  and  John  was  in  love.  He  in- 
sisted u|>on  promoting  this  new  girl,  the  like  of 
whom  he  had  never  known  before.  Garbo  has 
been  called  "a  peasant  with  flashes  of  genius." 
Jack  was  accustomed  to  neither  peasants  nor 
many  flashes  of  genius.  Spurred  by  curiosity 
and  love,  he  determined  to  help  her. 

He  became  so  entangled,  both  personally  and 
publicly,  that  he  could  not  regain  his  own 
sparkling  identity.  Not  even  his  marriage  to 
Ina  Claire  made  people  think  of  him  as  any- 
thing but  the  ex-lover  of  Greta;  her  ex-screen 
partner,  (larbo  was  enough  of  an  individual  to 
stand  alone  when  the  team  parted.  Jack 
wasn't. 

Nils  Asther  had  played  in  a  picture  with  her 
in  Europe.  They  talked  the  same  language; 
they  had  the  same  reminiscences.  Their  in- 
terest was  understandable.  Hut  a  man  does 
not  recover  from  Garboism  overnight!  Nils 
refused  to  study  English  for  talking  pictures, 
which  had  their  birth  at  the  end  of  his  leading- 
man  days  with  Garbo.  I  have  often  wondered 
how  much  his  refusal  to  concentrate  upon  a 
language  had  to  do.  at  that  time,  with  his  con- 
centration upon  Garbo! 

T  INTERVIEWED  Gavin  Gordon  while  he 
*■  was  making  "Romance."  He  was  .-ngered 
because  I  described  him  as  a  boy  so  madly  in 
love  with  a  woman  that  he  had  lost  his  common 
sense.  But  that  is  exactly  how  it  appeared.  He 
could  talk  of  nothing  but  Garbo  and  he  stut- 
tered with  excitement  as  he  talked!  No  man  so 
hopelessly,  boyishly,  stutleringly,  in  love  could 
have  given  a  strong  performance  opposite  the 
woman  who  so  affected  him.  Not  unless  the 
love  were  returned  in  the  same  proportions! 

Gavin  Gordon  was  heroic  during  the  making 
of  that  picture.    He  played  many  scenes  with  a 


broken  shoulder.  But  he  did  not  do  this  to 
show  himself  a  good  trouper.  He  actually 
forgot  his  pain  (so  he  told  me;  because  he  was 
iirbo. 

She  could  not  change  the  situation,  patient 
as  she  was.  She  did  everything  she  could  to 
help  this  lad  overcome  his  mooning;  to  help 
him  act.  But  he  was,  inevitably,  only  a  back- 
ground for  her  when  the  picture  was  released. 

I  talked  with  Ramon  Novarro  when  he  began 
"Mata  Hari."  He  was  prepared  to  worship. 
He  worshipped.  His  eleven  years  of  stardom 
and  popularity,  dating  back  to  long  before  the 
name  "Garbo"  was  known,  seemed  to  mean 
nothing.  He  was  like  a  school  boy,  with  his 
first  great  opportunity. 

•"THERE  was  a  difference  between  Ramon's 
*-  love  for  Greta  and  the  love  bestowed  upon 
her  by  other  men.  You  know  that  this  Spanish 
lad  is  deeply  religious;  truly  artistic.  His  reli- 
gion, his  devotion  to  true  art.  his  native  Span- 
ish chivalry  were  all  combined  in  the  adoration 
he  gave  this  woman,  and  still  does.  She  is,  to 
him,  a  personification  of  ideal  womanhood  and 
perfected  artistry.  It  is  a  beautiful  and  in- 
spiring adoration. 

He  placed  fresh  roses  in  her  dressing-room 
each  morning  as  he  would  light  candles  before 
a  shrine. 

But — he  completely  forgot  Ramon  Novarro, 
as  the  romantic  Jack  Gilbert  and  the  mooning 
Gavin  Gordon  had  forgotten  themselves. 
Ramon  was  too  busy  paying  tribute  to  his  ideal 
woman  to  watch  the  acting  of  Ramon.  He  be- 
came an  indefinite  background.  And  he  hurt 
Garbo's  picture  by  so  doing. 

In  fact,  they  have  all  hurt  her  pictures  by 
becoming  "saps" — as  one  Hollywood  observer 
has  called  them — rather  than  remaining  he- 
men.  As  great  as  the  Garbo  pictures  have 
been,  they  would  have  been  greater  had  the 
men  equaled  the  woman  in  them. 

Charles  Bickford  did.  There  was  no  place 
for  Garboism  in  the  mental  and  physical 
strength  of  this  man.  He  didn't  want  to  make 
"Anna   Christie";  refused   to  work  in  it  for 


Before  the  second  baby  was  born  Jack  Barrymore  said  he  didn't  care 
whether  it  was  another  girl  or  not,  but  keen  observers  note  that  he  is  about 
the  proudest  papa  in  Hollywood  because  there  is  another  Barrymore  man 
to  carry  on  the  tradition.  And  w^e'll  bet  that  some  day  John  Blythe  Barry- 
more will  be  playing  "Hamlet."  Mama  Dolores  Costello  doesn't  care 
about   her   best   camera   angle,   so  long    as    baby   John    gets    a    break 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  September,  1932 


several  weeks.  Production  was  held  up  until 
Louis  B.  Mayer  and  Irving  Thalberg  could 
tactfully  persuade  him  to  play  in  it.  Had  they 
ordered  Charlie,  he  would  not  have  played  it. 
They  sold  him  on  it.  Had  they  ordered  Garbo, 
she  would  not  have  made  it.  And  there  you 
have  it — two  people  who  can  never  be  ordered 
but  must  always  be  cleverly  persuaded. 

There  is  no  doubt  that  Garbo  has  the  most 
dominant  personality  on  the  screen  today. 
The  Bickford  personality  is  one  of  the  most 
dominant,  both  on  and  off  the  screen.  Which 
is  the  reason  there  was  no  Garbo  jinx  for 
Charlie. 

TOURING  the  making  of  "Anna  Christie," 
-'—'Charlie  ate  at  the  publicity  table  in  the 
M-G-M  commissary,  exactly  as  he  had  during 
the  making  of  other  pictures.  He  talked  about 
the  cast  exactly  as  he  had  about  all  others — 
despite  the  fact  that  to  discuss  a  Garbo  picture 
was  forbidden  by  the  highest  officials.  He 
thought  her  a  grand  sport,  a  tine  workman,  an 
intelligent  human  being.  If  he  hadn't  thought 
that,  he  would  have  said  so. 

He  talked  with  her  between  scenes  as  he 
would  have  talked  with  any  woman  with  whom 
he  was  working.  They  went  for  walks  to- 
gether, practising  their  lines.  Of  course,  Garbo 
may  have  been  a  little  more  down-to-earth  and 
sociable  at  this  time.  It  was  her  first  talkie. 
She  was  frankly  nervous,  never  having  spoken 
an  English  line  in  public  before  and  not  know- 
ing whether  she  was  to  be  a  flop  or  a  success. 
She  had  taken  the  script  for  "Anna  Christie" 
into  the  mountains  and  studied  for  weeks  be- 
fore they  began  shooting.  She  knew  the  lines, 
but  she  was  uncertain  of  the  delivery.  Charlie 
was  a  well-known  stage  actor.  He  could  help 
her.  He  did — as  he  would  have  helped  any 
woman. 

There  were  rumors  that  it  was  Greta  whose 
thoughts  turned  toward  Charlie  during  "Anna 
Christie."  We  cannot  vouch  for  the  veracity 
of  these  rumors,  but  Charlie  is  the  type  of 
dominant  man  who  would  have  to  be  sought 
and  then  given  command.  It  is  possible  that 
such  a  one  would  intrigue  the  heretofore  com- 
manding Garbo. 

Greta  Garbo  on  the  screen  has  such  strength 
of  personality  that  only  one  man  has  held  his 
own  in  competition  with  it.  We  eliminate 
"Grand  Hotel"  because  rivalry  was  the  key- 
note of  that  production.  John  Barrymore  was 
not  appalled  by  one  personality,  he  was  at- 
tempting to  get  his  face  before  the  camera  as 
often  as  six  others.  Garbo,  alone,  was  unper- 
turbed by  the  competition.  She  had  a  job  to 
do  and  she  did  it  without  worrying  about 
anybody  else. 

We  are  speaking  of  pictures  in  which  there 
was  one  definite  leading  man  for  this  woman. 
None  of  these  men  are  weaklings.  They  all 
have  proved  charm  and  ability.  All  had  suc- 
ceeded either  on  the  stage  or  the  screen  or  both 
before  they  played  with  her.  Undoubtedly, 
however,  none — with  the  exception,  of  course, 
of  Bickford — is  as  strong  a  personality  as 
Garbo.  With  their  normal  strength  weakened 
by  a  complex  of  awe,  worship  and  inferiority, 
what  chance  did  they  have  against  the  jinx  of 
Garboism? 

A  DD  to  these  drawbacks  the  type  of  role 
-*  »-most  of  these  men  were  pledged  to  play! 
Remember,  Garbo  is  generally  a  strange  woman 
in  her  pictures  as  she  is  in  life.  She  is  usually, 
on  the  screen,  the  aggressor,  the  wooer — the 
epitome  of  the  Shady  Dame  of  which  Photo- 
play told  you  last  month.  Any  man  placed  in 
the  position  of  the  one  being  wooed,  looks  like 
a  sap  to  the  public.  So  if  he  plays  the  role  of  a 
sap  and  acts  like  one  while  he  plays  it — what 
can  you  expect? 

Just  as  we  cannot  give  anyone  the  credit  for 
the  career  of  this  weird  woman  of  the  screen,  so 
we  cannot  blame  anyone  or  anything  for  the 
jinx  with  which  she  has  bedeviled  those  who 
have  played  with  her.  As  Norma,  Joan, 
Marlene  and  numerous  others  have  helped 
their  leading  men,  just  so  much  has  Garbo 
hindered  them.

If  You  Have  A  Good  Figure — Keep  It! 

|  CONTINUED  FROM  PACE  69  ) 


diets  can  be  taken  by  anyone  who  is  not  an 
invalid!     Make  no  mistake-  about  that! 

I  -aid  a  few  paragraphs  ago  that  no  matter 
how  plain  your  face,  if  you  had  a  beautiful 
figure  you  attract  attention.  That  still  goes, 
hill  you  can  improve  a  plain  and  even  a  homely 
face  if  you  listen  to  your  Aunt  Sylvia  and  do 
what  she  tells  you.  Did  you  know  that  you 
can  make  a  receding  chin  larger?  Well,  you 
can.  Of  course,  another  way  to  have  a  strong 
chin  is  to  develop  character.  Stop  being 
afraid;  speak  your  mind;  get  a  set  of  convic- 
tions and  live  up  to  them — that  will  make  a 
chin  for  you.  And  while  you're  starting  to 
build  character,  resolve  to  follow  my  exercises 
and  diets  and  stick  to  that  resolve. 


If  you  have  large  muscles  around  the  mouth, 
it 's  probably  from  nervous  tension.  Relax,  but 
also  take  this  exercise.  With  cold  cream 
smeared  over  your  face,  draw  your  lips  far  back 
into  an  exaggerated  smile  and  then  snap  the 
harpry  into  a  pucker.  Do  this  eight  or 
ten  times  a  day.  Then,  with  the  linger  tips, 
gently  massage  the  corners  of  the  mouth  and 
the  base  of  the  nose  in  a  rotating  movement. 
There — there  are  a  couple  of  ways  to  improve 
your  face      Now  snap  into  it. 

Lots  of  folks  have  wrinkled  elbows  from  ex- 
posure to  wind  and  sun.  Here's  how  to  cure 
that.  At  night,  put  a  generous  amount  of  cold 
cream  into  the  palm  of  one  hand  and  place  the 
elbow  in  that  hand.    Then  rub  with  a  rotating 


You  Must  Dance  to  Keep  a  Figure 
This  Way  Not  Like  This 


An  hour's  dancing  every  day  is  absolutely  essential  to  the  woman  who 
wants  to  get  or  to  keep  a  beautiful  figure.  But — you  must  take  the  po- 
sition I'm  in  at  the  left— chest  out,  shoulders  back.  This  will  reduce 
that  lump  of  fat  just  below  the  waistline,  will  keep  the  waist  thin  and 
make  your  whole  body  lithe  and  lovely.  Never,  never  slump  while  danc- 
ing as  I'm  doing  at  the  right.  And  this  goes  for  dancing  alone  as  exer- 
cise, and  ballroom  dancing  with  a  partner !  You've  got  to  be  alert,  always 


movement.  Leave  the  cold  cream  on  over 
night.  In  the  morning  after  your  shower  do 
the  same  thing  and  leave  the  cream  on  until 
just  before  you  put  on  your  dress.  Then  wipe 
it  off  with  tissue. 

Incidentally,  while  you  arc  squeezing  excess 
fat  oil  the  body,  you  can  use  cold  cream  or  not 
as  you  prefer,  but  you  must  always  use  it  when 
you're  taking  my  facial  treatments.  You  can 
squeeze  off  the  flesh  from  the  legs,  hips,  waist 
or  any  part  of  the  body,  but  be  sure  to  stick  at 
it  and  at  it  and  never  get  discouraged.  If  you 
use  cold  cream  for  the  body  massages,  be  sure 
that  it  is  a  light  cleansing  cream  that  will  not 
clog  the  pores. 

None  of  my  exercises  will  do  you  any  harm, 
nor  will  they  enlarge  the  tiny  broken  veins  that 
some  girls  have  on  their  legs.  I  do  not  approve 
of  Turkish  baths  except  for  cases  of  inflam- 
matory rheumatism  or  some  such  ailment 
where  they  have  been  recommended  by  a 
doctor.  If  you  are  an  average,  healthy  person, 
the  Turkish,  bath  lowers  resistance  and  robs 
you  of  the  pep  that  my  exercises  give  you. 

That  buttermilk  diet  I  gave  a  few  months 
ago  for  reducing  the  bust  will  tend  to  reduce 
you  all  over,  but  it  will  work  principally  on  the 
bust  and  stomach  and  I  don't  think  anyone 
should  object  to  that.  What  do  you  care  if 
you're  a  little  thin  in  other  places,  when  your 
bust  and  stomach  have  been  reduced  too?  You 
can  put  back  those  extra  pounds  you  lost  on 
the  other  parts  of  your  body  soon  enough. 
Extra  pounds  aren't  so  precious,  you  know! 

AND  now,  before  I  stop,  I  want  to  hand  you  a 
laugh.  Somebody  wrote  in  and  asked  if  there 
were  any  way  of  growing  taller  once  you'd  got 
your  height.  I've  heard  that  stretching  makes 
people  grow  taller — but  I'm  a  skeptical,  hard- 
boiled  dame  and  I've  got  to  see  it  with  my  own 
eyes  before  I  can  believe  it.  I've  seen  what  my 
diets  and  exercises  will  do.  But  I  never  saw 
anybody  grow  any  taller  after  she  had  her  full 
height. 

Next  month  I'm  not  going  to  be  so  good.  I'll 
be  back  in  my  old  lambasting,  bawling-out 
form  with  some  exercises  and  advice  that  you 
didn't  know  before.

These  Hysterical  Women 


GRYING  .  .  .  sobbing  .  .  .  laughing! 
She  has  no  control  of  herself  .  .  . 
the  slightest  thing  drives  her  to  distrac- 
tion. Tired  all  the  time  .  .  .  overwrought 
•  .  .  nerves  strung  to  the  breaking  point. 
Constant  headache,  backache,  and  dizzy 
spells  are  robbing  this  woman  of  youth, 
beauty  and  health. 

If  she  would  only  give  Lydia  E.  Pink- 
ham's  Vegetable  Compound  a  chance  to 


help  her.  How  well  and  happy  she  might 
be. 

The  tablet  form  is  so  easy  to  take.  Send 
fifty  cents  to  the  Lydia  E.  Pinkham  Medi- 
cine Company,  1172  Cleveland  St.,  Lynn 
Massachusetts  for  a  bottle  which  sells 
regularly  for  $1.50.  Let  us  prove  that  this 
medicine  can  do  for  you  what  it  has  done 
for  other  suffering  women.

Your 

Budget? 


MANY  people  are  finding 
it  difficult  to  make  "ends" 
meet  these  days — but  there  is  a

earnings  so  that  you  can  buy 
the  little  "extras"  that  you 
want. 

PHOTOPLAY  is  looking  for 
energetic  subscription  repre- 
sentatives everywhere.  The 
work  does  not  require  special 
training — it  is  pleasant  and  the

"Monthly  Broadcast  from 
Hollywood." 

The  general  beauty  of  its  roto- 
gravure and  duotone  color 
sections. 

Foremost  among  the  features 
exclusive  in  PHOTOPLAY  are 
the  Hollywood  fashions  by 
Seymour — and  now  "THE 
HOLLYWOOD  BEAUTY

Wyck  tells  the  beauty  secrets  of 
the  stars  and  how  to  improve

Here  are  the  funny  little  fellows  who  enliven  that 
very  bright  animated  cartoon,  "The  Mad  King," 
which  is  reviewed  below.  The  music  is  really  first- 
class    and  you  will  thoroughly  enjoy  this  gay  piece 


THE  MAD  KING 

Educational- 
Paul  Terry-Toons 

Don't  miss  this  gay,  foolish  bit  of  animated 
cartoon  nonsense.  It's  very  Gilbert  and  Sulli- 
vanish  with  rollicking  tunes  and  a  fair  damsel 
in  distress.  It's  actually  a  grand  parody  of 
'"The  Vagabond  King." 

ISLAND  OF  PERIL 

Principal  Pictures 

A  thrilling  glimpse  into  the  lives  and  customs 
of  the  inhabitants  of  the  bleak  and  barren 
Faroe  Islands.  There  is  a  story  winding  itself 
through  this  travalogue  that  makes  it  an  inter- 
esting and  worthwhile  journey. 

VENDETTA 

Educational- 
Kcndall-Dc  Vally 

Now  you  can  have  brief  moments  of  opera  on 
the  screen.  This  short  is  called  an  operaloguc 
and  is  based  on  that  famous  opera  "Cavalleria 
Rusticana. "  A  group  of  fine  voices  have  been 
assembled  and  the  settings  have  a  true  operatic 
flavor. 

JIMMY'S  NEW  YACHT 

Paramount 

Daughter  loves  poor  boy.  Boy  tells  family 
he  has  bought  a  boat.  They  think  it's  a  yacht, 
but  it's  only  a  tiny  motor-boat.  Upon  this 
none-too-new  plot  a  lot  of  very  funny  gags  are 
hung. 

HIS  ROYAL  SHYNESS 

Educational-.  1  ndy  Clyde 

Andy  Clyde  is  all  messed  up  with  post-war 
kingdom  troubles,  in  Bullgravia  this  time.  He 
is  both  doughboy  and  king — and  a  bit  of  a 
tippler  besides.    You  can't  help  laughing. 

A  REGULAR  TROUPER 

Vita  phone 

Ruth  Etting  is  the  star  of  this  and,  in  spite 
of  the  fact  that  the  brief  story  doesn't  give  her 


much  to  do,  she  does  manage  to  get  in  two 
songs.    The  yarn  has  a  backstage  atmosphere. 

II ATT  A  MARRI 

Educational-Mack  Sennett 

In  spite  of  the  title,  this  isn't  a  real  burlesque 
of  the  Garbo  picture.  Harry  Gribbon  bursts 
into  song  every  few  scenes  or  so.  The  plot,  if 
you  can  callit  that,  is  a  hodge-podge.  Dorothy 
Granger  is  Hatta  Marri.    Fairly  funny. 

UNION  WAGES 

Universal 

Back  to  the  days  when  slapstick  was  slap- 
stick, with  Louise  Fazenda  and  Sidney  Toler. 
Bathrooms  filled  with  water;  Louise  caught  in 
a  waterless  shower  with  soap  prickling  like  a 
cactus — you  know  the  rest.  Only  the  custard 
pies  are  missing. 

THE  CANDID  CAMERA 

Educational-Mack  Sennett 

If  you  want  a  new  car.  compromise  your  hus- 
band! Such  is  the  tidy  bit  of  advice  given  by 
old  maestro  Sennett.  Franklin  Pangborn,  as 
friend  hubby,  gets  caught  beach-mashing  just 
after  he  has  refused  to  buy  a  new  car.  Pretty 
funny. 

THE  ENGINEER'S  DA  UGHTER 

RKO-Pathe 

Here's  another  short  made  by  The  Maskers 
Club  but  it  is  much  funnier  than  the  average. 
It's  a  grand  burlesque  on  the  old-fashioned 
"drahma''  and  you  will  be  able  to  see  Hank 
Mann,  May  Robson,  Montagu  Love  and  lots 
of  other  favorites. 

ICE  MEN'S  BALL 
RKO-Radio 

You  are  due  for  a  grand  round  of  laughs  from 
Clark  and  McCullough's  antics  in  this.  They 
steal  a  police  car  and  go  on  radio  patrol.  One 
silly  situation  after  another.  Recommended 
for  any  kind  of  blues.

Cal  York's   Monthly  Broadcast  from  Hollywood 


CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  96  J 


TTrlERE  was  an  open  feud  between  Tallulah 
■*-  Bankhead  and  Marlene  Dietrich.  And  all 
because  of  a  certain  male. 

It  seems  Tallulah  strolled  onto  the  Dietrich 
Bet,  spied  the  lad  and  became  so  enamoured  she 
immediately  rushed  fortli  and  purchased  tons 
of  presents  for  her  adored  one.  And  he  was 
hers. 

Hut  the  next  day,  Marlene,  not  to  be  out- 
done, came  onto  the  set  loaded  to  the  chin  with 
mysterious  gifts  for  the  lad.  And  now  both 
ladies  are  even. 

And  little  Dickie  Moore,  just  six,  is  richer  by 
two  electric  trains,  bats,  balls,  games  and  what- 
nots. And  declares  he  loves  both  ladies  just 
the  same! 

"LTERE'S  a  good  one  about  the  wife  of  a  well 
A  ■•■known  vaudeville  actor  who  came  home 
from  a  party  the  other  evening  and  told  of 
being  insulted  by  one  of  the  male  guests. 

Her  husband  flew  into  a  rage.  He  tore  and 
raved  and  threatened  to  tear  the  insulter  limb 
from  limb. 

"Well,  if  you  mean  that,"  a  friend  said,  "I 
can  tell  you  where  to  find  him." 

Somewhat  taken  aback,  but  unable  to  back 
out,  he  got  into  his  car  and  roared  down  the 
street  to  avenge  his  wife. 

A  few  minutes  later  he  was  back. 

"Did  you  thrash  him,  dear?"  his  wife  asked. 

"No,"  he  sulked,  "but  I  was  awful  cold  to 
him." 

"V'OU  might  imagine  that  when  you  got  a  con- 
tract  at  a  studio  the  sacred  shrine  of  the 
Chief  Executive  would  be  easy  to  enter.  But 
not  a  bit  of  it.  The  job  of  getting  in  to  see  the

"Hello,  actress"  which  is  a  swell  compliment  from  a  Barrymore  to  a  new- 
comer. Between  scenes  of  "The  Washington  Masquerade"  they  chatted 
like  a  couple  of  old  cronies.  Karen,  played  with  both  Barrymores  in 
"Arsene  Lupin"  and  did  a  grand  job,  considering  the  keen  competition 


Folly"  was  in  the  preparatory  stages,  she  put 
her  name  down  on  the  long  list  of  people  anxious 
to  see  the  boss  producer. 


A  first  lady  of  the  stage  meets  a  first  lady  of  the  screen  and  if  you  don't 
believe  Norma  Shearer  is  just  that,  wait  until  you  see  "Strange  Interlude." 
Katherine  Cornell — great  stage  actress  who  has  held  out  steadily  against 
the  movies — visited  Norma  on  the  "Smilin*  Through"  set.  That's  Freddie 
March,  Norma's  leadii  j  man,  in  costume  and  Ralph  Forbes,  who'll  soon 
be  Ruth  Chatterton's  ix-husband,  on  Norma's  right.  Even  this  visit 
didn't  convince  Kit  Cornell  that  she  should  desert  Broadway  for  the  films 

1 26 


The  producer  worked  through  the  list,  ac- 
cording to  his  custom. 

The  poor  chap  works  fourteen  hours  a 
day.  After  more  than  two  months  Frances 
was  ushered  into  his  presence. 

"You  wished  to  see  me?"  said  the  boss. 
"What  can  I  do  for  you?" 

Timidly  Frances  spoke  up.  "I  only  wanted 
to  ask  you  if  I  could  have  the  daughter  role  in 
'Rich  Man's  Folly',"  she  said.  "But  it  doesn't 
matter  now — we  finished  the  picture  two  weeks 
ago." 

AND  now  Hollywood  wants  to 
know  just  what  New  York  has 
done  to  its  own  madcap  Lupe?  She 
arrived  in  Hollywood  recently  without 
the  least  fuss  or  confusion.  Quietly, 
like  a  subdued  little  mouse,  she  stole 
into  town  and  away  again  before 
people  even  realized  she  was  here. 
Which  is  so  unlike  Lupe  that  Holly- 
wood is  worried! 

V\  7T,  wondered  if  that  Maureen  O'SuIIivan- 
^^  Jimmy  Dunn  romance  were  getting  so 
serious  that  wedding  bells  were  imminent.  The 
two  are  so  constantly  together. 

We  talked  to  a  close  friend  of  Jimmy's. 
"No!"  the  friend  laughed.  "Jimmy's  Irish. 
He's  just  got  to  be  violently  in  love  with  some- 
one to  be  happy.  It  was  just  the  same  with 
June  Knight,  but  when  she  left — Jimmy  must 
have  romance  but  I  don't  think  that  means 
marriage!" 

And  that's  that.

/"COLUMBIA  simply  couldn't  decide  on  a 
^"'general  for  "The  Bitter  Tea  of  General 
Yen."    And  then  someone  had  a  bright  idea. 

Fifty  office  girls,  stenographers  and  secre- 
taries, were  herded  into  a  projection  room  while 
test  after  test  of  prominent  leading  men,  was 
shown. 

Then  a  vote  for  the  colorful  role  of  the 
general  was  taken.  And  out  of  the  fifty  men 
considered,  48  of  the  50  girls  voted  for  Nils 
Asther.    So  a  Swede  will  play  a  Chinaman. 

TTARPO  MARX  is  wandering 
■*■  -*-around  with  a  sad,  bewildered 
look  these  days.  Harpo  came  out  of 
the  Brown  Derby  recently  and  was 
met  by  a  young  woman  with  a  pencil 
and  autograph  book  clutched  in  her 
hand. 

She  walked  up  to  Harpo  and  peered 
into  his  face  with  a  puzzled  look. 

"Pardon  me,"  she  finally  said, 
"but  are  you  anybody?" 

A  LL   the   criticism   that   came   after  Joan 
"■Crawford  changed  her  mouth  make-up  to 
those  heavy  dark  lips  has  reached  Joan's  ears. 
And  from  now  on  it's  going  to  be  different. 

For  one  thing,  she  used  a  different  sort  of  lip- 
stick in  "Letty  Lynton"  that  photographed 
darker  than  she  thought  it  would,  and  because 
the  character  was  a  voluptuous  type  of  girl  she 
made  the  mouth  bigger.  In  "Rain"  the  mouth 
will  be  that  way  again,  for  Sadie  Thompson 
wasn't  noted  for  her  cupid's  bow  lips.  But, 
after  that,  la  Crawford  returns  to  her  own 
natural  mouth.     Pleased,  girls? 

TT  was  a  long,  hot  day  on  the  set,  and  Peggy 
Shannon  had  struggled  for  her  virtue  with  the 
villain  for  several  hours. 

Finally  she  turned  to  the  director  and  said: 

"Listen!  You'll  have  to  shoot  this  scene 
pretty  quick  or  rewrite  the  whole  story!" 

"Why?"  the  director  asked. 

"Well,"  she  replied,  "about  two  more 
struggles  and  I'll  be  so  tired  I'll  have  to  give 
in."

r^oROTHY  MACKAILL  is  a  smart  girl— 
■■-'and  she  heat  'em  all  to  the  punch.  You 
know  that  she  and  her  crooner  husband,  Neil 
Miller,  have  been  doing  a  vaudeville  act  with 
Jack  Benny  and  Ukelele  Ike.  In  the  routine 
Benny  and  Ike  keep  calling  Miller  "Mr. 
MackaUl"  and  he  keeps  howling,  "The  name 
is  Miller." 

When  somebody  asked  Dot  if  Neil  didn't 
t  to  all  this  kidding,  she  countered,  "  Win- 
should  he? 

'"Anyone  out  of  the  profession  who  marries 
a  picture  star  is  going  to  be  kidded  as  "Mr.  So 
<'  anyhow. 

''We  simply  beat  the  mob  to  it.  and  get 
plenty  of  laughs  out  of  it  on  the  stage.  Isn't 
that  good  showmanship?'' 

GIVE  Bob  Montgomery  a  well 
deserved  hand.  He's  giving  up 
his  beloved  game  of  polo.  And  that's 
the  same  as  giving  up  pie  to  the  small 
boy. 

Bob    is    selling    his    ponies    and 
spending  the  proceeds  on  three  needy 
families  he  knows. 
Good  boy,  Bob! 

Y\  7HF.X  an  actor  goes  after  stardom,  tooth 
and  nail,  that's  just  ambition.  But  when 
an  actor  has  stardom  handed  him  on  a  silver 
platter  and  say's  take  it  away,  well,  Hollywood 
calls  that  insanity. 


But  that's  exactly  what  Stu  Erwin  has  ■ 
The  exhibitors  and  fans  yelled  so  loudly  for 
Stu.    Paramount  decided    the   Ixjv  had   some- 
thing besides  a  funny  face  and  offered   him 
stardom. 

They  even  gave  him  a  picture  called 
"Make  Me  a  Star."  But  Stu  won't  have 
the  star  thing  on  a  bet,  and  in  answer  to 
his  picture  says,  "Don't  'Make  Me  a  Star' 
with  all  its  grief  and  sorrow 

And  any  time  anyone  thinks  there  isn't 
plenty  of  horse  sense  behind  that  dead  pan 
of  Stu's,  guess  again. 

T^NII)  you  ever  wonder,  girls,  as  you  sat  there 
■'""'^listening  to  the  husky  tones  of  Bing 
Crosbv's  voice  just  how  he  picked  up  that  name 
"Bing 

Well,  it  seems  Harry  Crosby  was  one  of 
those  little  boys  the  girls  all  picked  on.  Which 
is  a  pretty  sure  sign  a  little  miss  is  interested. 

At  any  rate,  one  of  his  tormentors  went  a  bit 
too  far  one  day  and  Harry  chased  her  all  the 
way  home. 

She  dashed  inside  the  house  and  leanirg 
out  a  window  called,  "You  look  just  like 
Bingo  in  the  funny  papers."  And  that  was 
enough.  They  shortened  it  to  "Bing"  and 
"  Bing"  it's  been  ever  since. 

And  now  he's  in  Hollywood,  girls,  making 
"The  Big  Broadcast"  for  Paramount,  and  soon 
you'll  hear  those  husky  tones  from  the  screen. 
In  case  you're  interested.

It  just  happens  that  the  stars  are 
informed  in  the  ways  of  beauty.  They 
know  what  to  demand  of  their  creams 
and  their  lipsticks  and  their  powder. 

How  do  they  judge  a  face  powder? 
They  insist  that  it  be  light  and  fine, 
so  that  it  will  spread  evenly  over  the 
face.  That  it  give  a  smooth,  perfect 
effect,  without  covering  up  the  trans- 
parent texture  of  the  flesh.  Not 
too  light,  since  then  it  would  not 
cling.  Not  too  heavy,  since  then  the 
face  would  be  a  dull,  dead  mask. 

Because  it  meets  these  strict  re- 
quirements, the  new  Pompeian  is  the 
perfect  face  powder.  It  does  not  coat 
the  skin.  It  clings  for  hours.  It  gives 

FIVE         CENTS         THE         BOX         • 


a  soft  fine-textured  finish.  It  is  devel- 
oped in  new  tones  that  enhance  the 
natural  colorings.  Flesh  for  the  very 
light  skin,  Naturelle  (Nude)  for  the 
blonde  with  a  fair  complexion,  Rachel 
for  the  brunette  with  a  fair  skin. 
Peach  for  the  blonde  with  a  warm 
skin  tone,  and  Dark  Rachel,  a  warm 
rich  tone  for  the  brunette  with  a 
dark  skin.  You'll  love  the  new  deli- 
cate fragrance  and  the  smart  new  con- 
venient box.  Pay  more  for  your  face 
powder  if  you  will,  but  you  can't 
purchase  better  powder  than  the  mod- 
ern Pompeian.  The  Pompeian  Creams, 
Lipsticks  and  Rouges  are  equally  high 
in  quality  and  low  in  price.

A  frank 

discussion 

at  last 

on  a  subject  that 
has  long  been  "taboo" 


IET  sleeping  dogs  lie!"  So  said 
^  the  cigarette  trade  when  first 
we  raised  the  subject  of  inhaling. 
But  dodging  an  important  issue  is 
not  Lucky  Strike's  policy! 

Do  you  inhale?  That  question  is 
vitally  important ...  for  every  smoker 
inhales  —  knowingly  or  unknow- 
ingly. Every  smoker  breathes  in 
some  part  of  the  smoke  he  or  she 
draws  out  of  a  cigarette!  And  the 
delicate  membranes  of  your  throat 
demand  that  your  smoke  be  pure, 
clean  — free  of  certain  impurities! 

No  wonder  Lucky  Strike  dares  to 
raise  this  vital  question !  For  Luckies 
bring  you  the  protection  you  want 
...  because  Luckies'  famous  purify- 
ing  process  removes  certain  im- 
purities concealed  in  every  tobacco 
leaf.  Luckies  created  that  process. 
Only  Luckies  have  it! 

So,  whether  you  inhale  know- 
ingly or  unknowingly,  safeguard 
those  delicate  membranes!

HER  husband  would  probably  notice 
in  a  minute  if  she  didn't  keep  the 
house  neat  and  clean.  But  don't  you  sup- 
pose he  notices  how  her  teeth  look,  too? 
While  she's  taking  such  good  care  of  the 
house,  it  might  be  wise  for  her  to  keep 
her  teeth  good-looking,  too! 

Do  you  realize  that  while  today's  foods 
are  delicious,  they  are  too  soft  to  stimu- 
late the  gums?  Gradually  your  gums  have 
become  flabby  and  tender.  If  you  haven't 


"pink  tooth  brush''  already,  you  prob- 
ably will  have  it  unless  you  do  something 
about  those  touchy  gums  of  yours. 

And  "pink  toothbrush"  not  onlv tends 
to  dull  the  teeth,  but  it  often  leads  to 
Vincent's  disease,  gingivitis,  and  even 
pyorrhea.  And  it  may  endanger  perfectly 
sound  teeth. 

Today— get  a  tube  of  Ipana  Tooth 
Paste.  Clean  your  teeth  with  it.  And  each 
time,  rub  a  little  extra  Ipana  into  those 
sickly  gums  of  yours. 


Ipana  really  cleans  the  teeth !  And  because 
it  contains  ziratol,  Ipana  with  regular 
daily  massage  tones  up  the  gums,  stimu- 
lates thecirculation  through  the  walls,  and 
helps  bring  them  back  to  healthy  firmness. 
Before  you  have  used  up  one  tube  of 
Ipana,  and  rubbed  it  regularly  into  your 
gums,  your  teeth  will  begin  to  glisten 
and  your  gums  to  show  marked  im- 
provement. Keep  on  using  Ipana  with 
massage,  and  you  can  forget  all  about 
"pink  tooth  brush."

There's  praise  in  every  mail  for  Constance 
Bennett  in  "What  Price  Hollywood."  One 
reader  said  the  "calm  Connie  forgot  her 
press-agented  poise  and  acted  like  a  real  girl 
with  real  emotions."  They  raved,  too,  about 
Lowell   Sherman,   shown  here  with   Connie 


"King  Clark  can  do  no  wrong!"  shout  all  his 
fans.  "Give  him  more  varied  roles  and  he 
will  show  what  a  fine  actor  he  really  is" — 
that's  the  gist  of  all  their  letters.  Nothing  but 
bouquets  this  month  for  "What-A-Man"

THE  $25  LETTER 

TO  MICKEY 

(With  apologies  to  "The  Barefoot  Boy") 

Blessings  on  thee,  Mickey  Mouse, 
At  our  talking  picture  house! 
With  thy  patched-seat  pantaloons, 
And  thy  jazzy  whistled  tunes; 
With  thy  turned-up  nose,  no  part 
Of  some  plastic  surgeon's  art; 
And  thy  long  tail's  jaunty  grace 
Curling  round  thy  funny  face; 
Surcease  from  all  shady  dames 
And  tough  heroes'  fancy  names. 
Clown  thou  art — and  clown  continue, 
Lit  not  Tarzan's  bone  and  sinew, 
Or  some  gangster's  Latin  grace, 
Make  thee  change  thy  role  or  face. 
Thou  has  something  which  no  tragic 
Ai  tor  matches — thou  hast  magic 
In  thy  land  of  make-believing; 
Saving  Minnie  from  her  grieving, 
Slaying  giants  on  stick  horses, 
Far  from  rent  bills  and  divorces; 
With  disaster  always  pending, 
Yet  sure  of  a  happy  ending. 
Laughter  follows  by  thy  name — 
So — here's  to  thee  and  thy  fame!

THE  $10  LETTER 

Connie  Bennett  is  still  a  big  favorite  with 
me.  Even  if  she  is  supposed  to  be  high-hat  or 
temperamental,  it  doesn't  seem  to  affect  her 
charming  entertainment  value.  She  has  the 
looks,  she  can  act  and  she's  not  "everyday." 

Recently  when  the  whole  world  looked  dark, 
after  a  particularly  trying  week  of  making  beds 
and  doing  dishes,  wiping  little  noses  or  kissing 
big  bumps,  I  dropped  into  "What  Price  Holly- 
wood," just  to  watch  her  for  a  few  hours,  and 
the  whole  world  seemed  different.    I  bought  a 


bit  of  allover  lace,  came  home  decidedly  re- 
freshed, tackled  the  necessary  household  chores 
and  then — I  made  a  new  lace  top  for  an  old 
black  skirt  (suggested  by  one  sequence  in  the 
picture) — cut  bangs  a  la  Bennett,  and  faced 
the  world  again  with  new  pep.

THE  $5  LETTER 

A  few  words  from  the  land  of  Pharaohs 
about  films  and  stars.  Able  artists  should 
appear  only  in  interesting  plays.  Sometimes 
the  play  is  so  poor  and  uninteresting,  but  the 
actors  are  able  and  famous.  Just  the  same  as 
books,  with  line  edition,  luxuriously  clothed, 
but  with  nonsense  materials.  George  Arliss 
demonstrated  bis  wonderful  and  most  excellent 


THOSE  fighting  fans  of  Clark  Gable! 
How  they  did  bombard  us  with 
brickbats  for  our  recent  article,  "Will 
Clark  Gable  Last?"  in  which  the  writer 
merely  intimated,  as  her  personal 
opinion,  that  Clark  might  not  be  as 
versatile  an  actor  as  he  is  a  convincing 
one.  She  must  be  wrong — fifty  million 
fans  can't  be! 

Readers  are  still  raving  about  Connie 
Bennett's  performance  in  "What  Price 
Hollywood" — strange  that  the  "orchid 
girl  of  the  screen"  should  make  her  big- 
gest hit  to  date  in  the  role  of  a  movie- 
struck  waitress! 

"American  Madness,"  "The  First 
Year,"  and  "Red-Headed  Woman"  con- 
tinue to  be  the  most  discussed  pictures. 
And  folks  say  they  want  to  laugh  more, 
and  thev  sav  a  lot  of  other  interesting 
things,  too,  so  read  their  letters  for  your- 
self.    And  then  tell  us  what  \om  think. 


capacity  as  an  actor  in  "Disraeli" — the  right 
man  in  the  right  cinema. 

Producers  advertise  the  star  who  will  play  in 
next  picture.  Not  a  word  about  the  story.  It 
seems  the  general  public  must  only  attend 
cinema  performances  to  admire  the  beauty  of 
the  star.  But  no,  no,  we  do  not  attend  cinemas 
as  to  a  beauty  parlor! 
Yervaxt  Kutchukiax,  Alexandria,  Egypt. 

THAT  ABLE  GABLE 

There  was  entirely  too  much  prejudice  in 
that  article  in  your  August  issue  about  Clark 
Gable.  "He  isn't  versatile'?  How  do  you 
know?  Whose  fault  is  it  that  he's  given 
"typical  Clark  Gable  parts"?  George  Arliss 
always  plays  "typical  George  Arliss  parts" 
and  no  one  dreams  of  panning  him! 

Mary  A.  Ball,  Tonington,  Conn. 

I've  lived  in  Houston  several  years  and  was 
here  at  the  time  Gable  was  leading  man  in  the 
stock  company.  I  never  missed  a  week.  I  saw 
Gable  play  all  sorts  of  roles  and  never  found 
him  lacking  in  any  part.  He's  a  real  man  and 
a  real  actor,  and  I  hope  his  success  will  last. 
Mozllle  Games,  Houston,  Texas. 

It  seems  to  me  that  Clark  Gable  is  Rudolph 
Valentino,  come  back  to  life.    Why  not  have 
Mr.  Gable  play  a  role  in  an  Arabian  picture  to 
prove  he  is  a  new  Valentino?    He  can  do  it. 
Robert  Nasif  Siiebax,  Cleveland,  O. 

LIONEL  AND  KAREN 

Lionel  Barrymore  and  Karen  Morley  should 
be  teamed  again  and  again,  for  they  do  brilliant 
work  together.  They,  and  the  unusual  theme 
of  "The  Washington  Masquerade,"  made  that 
a  memorable  picture  for  me.

BETTER  Ul  Y   SEASON  TICKETS! 

I  took  my  brood  of  four  children,  youngest 
eight,  eldest  seventeen,  to  see  "Congorifia." 
The  result?  I  have  had  to  promise-  I  will  take 
them  all  back  again.  They  are  fascinated  by 
the  pygmies  and  won't  be  satisfied  until  we 
have  another  "Congorilla  Theater  Party."

SIT  ART  ERWIN 

Have  just  seen  "Make  Me  A  Star."  and  if 
that  picture  doesn't  make  a  star  of  Stuart 
Erwin,  there  just  isn't  any  justice!  It  was  one 
of  the  finest  performances  I've  seen  in  many  a 
day.  In  fact,  it  was  far  finer  than  a  "per- 
form.i  I've  always  admired  Stuart 
Erwin,  hut  in  this  picture  he  is  simply  amazing.

8 


"Make  Me  A  Star,"  with  Stuart  Erwin,  was  taken  as  a  literal  request 
by  his  loyal  fans.  "And  why  not?"  they  asked  after  seeing  this 
picture.  And  Paramount  echoed,  "Why  not?"  But  Stuart  wants 
good,  meaty  roles,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  they  are  stellar 
parts.  So,  still  wearing  that  bewildered  look,  he  turned  down  stardom 


miration  for  Walter  Huston's  performance  in 
"American  Madness."  He  was  earnest,  con- 
vincing and  completely  natural.  I  never  miss 
one  of  his  pictures,  because  I  know  it  will  be 
among  the  best  if  he  is  in  it. 

Mrs.  L.  A.  Yickery,  Kansas  City,  Mo. 

What  an  interesting  picture  "American 
Madness"  is.  I  never  realized  before  that  a 
story  about  Big  Business  and  the  Depression 
could  be  made  so  entertaining,  and  I  have 
never  seen  more  gripping,  intense  scenes  than 
those  during  the  run  on  the  bank.  Walter 
Huston  gave  a  remarkable  performance,  and 
Pat  O'Brien  ran  him  a  close  second.  Constance 
Cummings  is  new  to  me,  but  now  I'll  be  eager 
to  see  her  next  picture.    She's  sweet! 

Henriette  Leslie,  Spokane,  Wash. 

THAT  "FIRST  YEAR" 

Don't  give  us  any  more  pictures  in  which 
Gaynor  and  Parrel]  squabble  as  they  did  in 
"The  First  Year."  Keep  them  sweethearts  in 
their  pictures. 

Harriett  A.  Eger,  Springfield,  Mass. 

Leila  Bennett,  the  colored  maid  of  the  long 
stage  run  of  "The  First  Year,"  repeating  the 
role  in  pictures,  steals  the  show  from  Charlie 
Farrell  and  Janet  Gaynor. 

E.  C.  Wilson,  Kansas  City,  Mo. 

QUICK  REPAIRS 

At  the  end  of  "The  First  Y"ear,"  Charles 
Farrell  lights  with  an  old  admirer  of  Janet 
Gaynor  and  his  coat  sleeve  is  torn  nearly  out 
of  the  coat.  Yet,  a  few  minutes  later,  the  coat 
is  apparently  all  right. 

M.  F.  Headrk  k,  Windsor,  Ont.,  Can. 

In  "The  First  Year."  in  which  Janet  Gaynor 
and  Charles  Farrell  starred,  I  noticed  the  fol- 
lowing slip-up  in  the  scene  between  Tom  and 


Dick:  While  fighting,  Tom's  coat  was  torn  in 
two.  A  moment  later,  while  being  carried  out 
on  the  porch,  he  had  a  new  coat  on. 

Mildred  Sharrow,  Mt.  Clemens,  Mich. 

MAKE    EM  LAUGH 

Often,  when  I  go  to  see  a  show,  the  comedy 
or  the  animated  cartoons  are  better  than  the 
main  feature.  I've  grown  very  tired  of 
the  majority  of  films.  Everything  has  gone 
sophisticated,  "mysterious,"  and  Garbo.  What 
we  want  is  comedy.  Give  us  more  of  ZaSu 
Pitts,  Ford  Sterling,  Eddie  Cantor,  Harold 
Lloyd,  Lloyd  Hamilton,  Charlie  Chaplin  and 
Marie  Dressier! 

Richard  C.  Littlehales,  Portland,  Ore. 

After  a  monotonous  day's  work,  I  think 
there  is  nothing  so  grand  and  so  restful  as  to 
laugh.  I  love  to  watch  Marie  Dressier,  the 
queen  of  comedy,  cavorting  with  Polly  Moran, 
Marie's  sidekick  and  able  foil  for  Marie's  wit. 
Wally  Beery's  boyish  grin  endears  him  to  all 
his  fans.  Then  there  is  Jimmy  Durante — he  of 
the  big  nose.  How  that  accent  and  schnozzle 
slay  the  audiences!  The  comedy  teams — Stan 
Laurel,  with  his  pitiful  whimper,  and  Hardy, 
with  his  coy  manner  and  patient  air.  ZaSu 
Pitts,  with  her  fluttering  hands,  frightened 
voice,  and  "Oh,  dear,  what  shall  I  do?" 
manner. 

Personality?  Glamour?  Sex-appeal?  They've 
got  more  of  what  it  takes  than  any  of  the 
dramatic  stars  could  ever  hope  to  have. 

Amy  F.  McClixton,  Toronto,  Ont.,  Can. 

I  like  to  see  pictures  that  send  me  away 
laughing,  not  with  a  depressed  or  unhappy 
feeling.  There  will  always  be  films  of  the  latter 
variety,  however,  and  what  would  happen  if 
there  were  no  short  subjects  to  brighten  the 
program?  I  especially  enjoy  Eddie  Buzzell's 
"Bedtime  Stories  for  Grown-ups."  The  one 
about    Columbus    discovering    America    will 


What  You  Think  of  Pictures  and  Stars 


"The  sweet  love  of  a  man  and  wife"  and  other  fine  qualities  por- 
trayed in  "The  Doomed  Battalion"  won  the  praise  of  a  mother  who 
saw  this  film  with  her  young  daughter.  "What  an  inspiration  for 
something  fine  was  given  young  people,"  this  mother  writes  in 
speaking  of  the  fine  performance  of  Tala  Birell  and  Luis  Trenker 


always  remain  in  my  memory.  Please,  for 
goodness'  sake,  don't  let  anybody  stop  him 
from  continuing  his  silly  but  delightful  non- 
sense. 

And  when  a  cartoon  of  Mickey  Mouse  or 
Betty  Boop  flashes  on  the  screen  I  know  I  can 
sit  back  and  smile,  if  only  for  a  little  while. 
William  Frve,  Milwaukee,  Wis. 

SHE  SIGHS  FOR  THE  "SINGIES" 

Just  because  producers  gave  singing  actors 
poor  pictures  that  the  public  didn't  patronize, 
must  we  be  deprived  of  hearing  our  favorite 
stars  sing  in  good  pictures?  Please  let  us  have 
more  singing  from  Ramon  Novarro  and  John 
Boles,  in  pictures  as  good  as  "The  Pagan," 
"Desert  Song,"  and  "Rio  Rita." 

Bettixa  Boxxell. 

"WHAT  PRICE  HOLLYWOOD" 

The  fans  who  have  been  knocking  Constance 
Bennett  by  saying  that  she  is  too  aloof  have  an 
opportunity  to  realize  how  wrong  they  have 
been  all  the  time. 

To  those  brickbat  throwers,  I  recommend 
"What  Price  Hollywood,"  in  which  Miss 
Bennett  exhibits,  more  than  ever,  her  charm 
and  personality.  The  part  of  the  waitress  who 
climbs  to  the  pinnacle  of  movie  fame  is  Miss 
Bennett's  greatest  and  she  plays  it  with  much 
sincerity  and  understanding. 

Albert  Maxski,  Boston,  Mass. 

"What  Price  Hollywood"  is  a  knockout! 
Found  it  so  entertaining  that  I  stayed  to  see  it 
twice.  Lowell  Sherman  plays  his  part  mag- 
nificently. He  is  so  hilariously  funny  he  al- 
most runs  away  with  the  picture.  But,  of 
course,  the  audience  cannot  help  but  cast  ad- 
miring eyes  frequently  upon  the  gorgeous 
Constance  Bennett,  who  is  sweeter  and  acts 
better  than  ever. 

Frances  C.  Statzer,  Jersey  City,  N.  J. 


TYPING  GEORGE  RAFT? 

I  am  one  of  the  new  army  of  George  Raft 
admirers,  and  have  been  since  seeing  "Scar- 
face,"  which  I  attended  over  and  over  again. 
In  my  opinion  there  is  no  actor  on  the  screen 
today  who  has  Raft's  potentialities.  He  can 
take  a  part  and  make  it  live  without  overact- 
ing. But  I  am  afraid  his  ability  will  not  be  rec- 
ognized fully  unless  he  is  given  different  roles. 
How  can  his  popularity  last  if  it  is  built  only  on 
gangster  parts,  of  which  we  are  already  sur- 
feited? 

Mrs.  Cleo  Kranz,  New  York  City. 

PICTURES  IN  PRISON 

One  of  the  greatest  diversions  the  inmates  of 
San  Quentin  Prison  have  from  routine  is  the 
weekly  movie  show.  These  shows  are  linked 
up  with  the  Educational  Department  of  the 
prison  and  are  a  direct  incentive  to  study. 
Admission  to  the  show  is  based  on  regular 
attention  to  class  studies,  and  merit,  not 
money,  is  the  admission  price. 

Travel  and  war  pictures  are  probably  the 
most  popular.  Movies  here  encourage  men 
and  women  to  read,  and  in  the  library  of  19,000 
volumes  the  books  most  in  demand  are  those 
that  have  been  filmed. 

And  may  I  inject  a  purely  personal  opinion 
from  one  who  has  not  long  been  confined 
behind  these  gray  walls? — one  wearies  of  the 
never-ending  sex  pictures  that  are  turned  out 
with  machine-like  regularity. 

E.  J.  C,  San  Quentin,  Calif. 

"LADY  AND  GENT" 

Acting,  directing  and  dialogue  are  nearly 
perfect  in  "Lady  and  Gent,"  starring  George 
Bancroft.  Wynne  Gibson  and  James  Gleason. 
Wynne  Gibson's  characterization  of  the  hard- 
lustered  lady,  ashamed  of  her  womanliness,  and 
George  Bancroft's  presentation  of  the  slow- 
witted,    soft-hearted    pugilist    could    not    be

"THE  DOOMED  BATTALION" 

My  twelve-year-old  daughter  and  I  have 
just  seen  "The  Doomed  Battalion."  There 
were  no  difficult  questions  for  me  to  answer, 
because  the  picture  contained,  among  other 
things  of  beauty  and  interest: 

The  sweet  love  of  a  man  and  wife ;  their  un- 
compromised  friendship  for  another  man;  an 
adorable  baby;  fine  patriotism;  a  skiing  exhibi- 
tion, daring  and  breathtaking;  and  gorgeous 
mountain  scenery. 

In  front  of  us  sat  a  row  of  absorbed  young 
boys.  Behind  us  was  a  row  of  equally  inter- 
ested girls. 

What  an  inspiration  for  something  fine  was 
given  them  by  this  picture,  and  what  a  source 
of  real  pleasure  it  was. 

Glenda  Oppenheim,  Boise,  Idaho.

• 

"OKAY  AMERICA"  is  the  snappiest,  time- 
liest picture  ever  made  and  the  finest  perfor- 
mance LEW  AYRES  has  ever  given    the    screen. 

This  picture  shows  the  courage,  the  great  sense 
of  loyalty  and  of  duty  of  the  newspaper  man. 
This  is  the  first  time  the  newspaper  man  has 
been  shown  without  a  bottle  of  gin  —  and  the 
picture  shows  the  power  of  the  press  and  the 
radio   in  battling  crime. 

The  story  deals  with  the  kidnapping  by  gang- 
sters of  the  daughter  of  a  Cabinet  Member 
and  reveals  in  a  fast  moving,  tensely  dramatic 
story  how  a  newspaper  man  solves  a  mystery 
that  baffles  the  police  and  also  how  he  sacrifices'' 
himself  to  bring  to  a  halt  the  racketeering  in 
human  souls. 

It  is  more  than  a  newspaper  picture — more 
than  a  radio  picture.  It  is  full  of  suspense 
—  full  of  thrills  — full  of  intense  excitement  — 
yet  modern  and  true.

This  mark  means 

good  light 

at  low  cost/ 


WHETHER  or  not  you  get  all 
the  light  you  pay  for  depends 
upon  the  quality  of  the  lamps  you 
use. 

A  lamp  merely  transforms  elec- 
tric current  into  light.  Only  a 
lamp  that  is  correctly  designed 
and  accurately  made  will  give 
you  good  light  at  lowest  cost. 
A  good  lamp  will  not  consume 
current  extravagantly,  nor  will 
it  burn  out  or  blacken  before  it 
has  given  you  adequate  hours 
of  service. 
Let    us    repeat — whether   or   not 
you  get  all  the  light  you  pay  for 
depends  upon  the  quality  of  the 
lamps  you  use. 

You  can  identify  a  good  lamp 
just  as  you  do  any  other  piece  of 
excellent  merchandise,  by  the  name 
or  trademark  of  a  reliable  maker. 
When  you  buy  a  lamp  with  this 
mark  (jf<|)  on  the  bulb  and  the 
name  Edison  on  the  carton,  you 
are  sure  of  getting  all  the  light  you 
pay  for. 

Now  is  the  time  to  check  up  on 
your  lighting.  Get  a  carton  or  more 
of  Edison  Mazda  lamps  from  your 
nearest  dealer.  Then  you  are  as- 
sured of  good  light  at  low  cost.

What  the  Audience  Thinks 


CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  9  | 


•LIFE"'  AND  THE  MOVIES 

It  amuses  me  while  reading  reviews  of 
pictures  to  see  the  critic  has  described  a 
picture  as  "true  to  lite."  The  phrase  is  gener- 
ally used  for  some  grim  and  disheartening  film. 

Xo  critic  can  say  of  one  small  section  of  life, 
''This  is  life  as  it  is,"  for  life  is  lived  differently 
everywhere.  For  instance.  "  Possessed  "  is  just 
as  real  a  picture  of  a  certain  type  of  New  York 
life  as  "  Street  Scene"  is  of  another  type.  There 
are  artificial  and  frivolous  people  living  arti- 
ficial and  frivolous  lives;  and  there  are  fine, 
industrious  people  living  ordinarily  decent  lives. 
LUCY  Keating,  Rochester,  X.  V. 

"RED-HEADED  WOMAN" 

Thanks  to  the  "Red-Headed  Woman"  for 
the  discovery  of  a  new  Jean  Harlow.     She  has 
become  a  thoroughly  human  character,  radi- 
cally different  from  the  platinum  blonde. 
B.  L.  Garland,  Greensboro,  X.  C. 

I've  just  been  to  see  Jean  Harlow  in  "Red- 
Headed  Woman."  What  a  blues  chaser  that 
picture  is.  A  line  picture  for  everyone  to  see 
because  it  has  just  enough  sex  to  be  amusing. 
Of  course,  the  r6le  was  a  little  overdone,  but 
what's  the  difference?  Wasn't  Jean  good  to 
look  at  no  matter  what  she  did?  I  cannot 
this  letter  without  a  word  of  praise  for 
Chester  Morris.  In  my  opinion  he's  a  peach! 
Jean  Florio,  E.  Haven,  Conn. 

Photoplay,  how  could  you?  After  all  the 
years  that  I  have  depended  on  your  reviews  in 
choosin,r  movie  diet,  now  you  stand  me  up! 

Usually  I  avoid  sex-problem  plays,  but  you 
gave  this  one  such  a  boost!  "Risque."  you 
said  That  was  nothing  in  the  world  but  just 
plain  common!  And  as  for  Jean  Harlow,  well! 
With  her  platinum  locks  she  was  unreal  but 
exotic,  fascinatingly  different.  But  this  new 
red-headed  "hot-cha"  girl  is  nothing  but 
another  carbon  copy  of  Clara  Bow.  And 
hasn't  that  been  done  before? 

Hi  1 1  n  Pkk'i  .  Pennington,  X.  J. 

Iovn  (IUW  FORD 

It  seems  to  me  that  Joan  Crawford  has 
accomplished  the  one  difficult  thing  so  many 

in 


Scenes  like  this  one  from  "Red- 
Headed  Woman"  called  down 
storms  of  protest  on  Jean  Har- 
low's once-platinum  head.  And 
while  many  people  liked  the  red 
wig  she  wore,  one  disappointed 
movie-goer  described  the  new 
Jean  as  "another  carbon  copy  of 
Clara  Bow,"  the  old  platinum 
Jean  as  "fascinatingly  different" 


girls  dream  of  doing.  Rising  from  a  lower 
status  to  her  present  heights  is  in  truth  a 
modern  fairy  tale  that  holds  the  working  girl  of 
today  entranced. 

Even-  interview  she  gives  out,  every  picture 
that  she  plays  in.  every  photograph  she  has 
made  is  of  vital  interest  because  of  the  remark- 
able change  that  has  been  wrought  in  her 
since  her  early  pictures.  Is  it  any  wonder  she 
is  fascinating  to  us? 

Xeva  O'Hammer,  Wichita,  Kans. 

I  want  to  protest  against  the  whatever-it-is 
Joan  Crawford  has  done  to  her  one  and  only 
face!  It's  a  shame  that  this  beautiful  girl 
should  paint  her  mouth  so  grotesquely  to 
assure  the  public  that  she  is  "different."  Some 
people  tell  me  it  is  to  emulate  Garbo,  but  I 
doubt  this. 

Garbo  has  her  place,  but  Joan  has  her  own 
natural  beauty  and  charm.  I  am  waiting  for 
her  lovely  young  mouth  to  appear  again,  in 
the  natural. 

Mrs.  Y.  J.  Patterson,  Glendale,  Calif. 

HARMLESS  "FLAMES" 

Excuse  the  verse    I  will  be  terse"!  and  hurl  my 

little  brick. 
Poetic  license  please  forgive,  I'll  try  and  make 

it  quick. 
Have  you  beheld  the  picture  "Flames"?    Did 

you  see  what  I  saw? 
Oh.  well,  it's  nothing  serious,  nor  yet  against 

the  law. 
The  girl  stenogs  are  trapped  upon  a  burning 

roof  of  flame, 


The  husky  firemen  rescue  them,  which  proves 

that  they  are  game. 
Midst  smoke,  and  flame,  and  grimy  dirt  they 

carry  them  to  earth. 
Excuse  me,  reader,  while  I  pause,  to  hush  my 

howls  of  mirth. 
They  bear  the  gals  through  smoke  and  grime, 

where  dirt  and  danger  bristles. 
And  when  they  set  them  on  the  ground,  they're 

all  as  clean  as  whistles! 
With  gowns  unruffled,  chic  and  neat,  with  faces 

clean,  ho  hum! 
Xow  can  you  blame  a  fan  for  growling,  "What 

the  heck?    How  come?" 

Lorraine  E.  Grant,  Jackson,  Mich. 

CLARA'S  COMING  BACK! 

Three  cheers  for  that  plucky  little  Bow  sir!! 
Most  actresses  after  getting  the  raw  deal  that 
Clara  Bow  got  wouldn't  dare  try  to  make  a 
"comeback"  in  the  movies.  Clara  can  do  it, 
too! 

Dorothy  Harbison,  Sacramento,  Calif. 

"TOM  BROWN   OF  CULVER" 

"Tom  Brown  of  Culver"  was  a  good,  clean 
picture,  full  of  action  and  drama.  Pictures  of 
such  a  wholesome  nature  are  welcomed  by 
everyone,  young  or  old.  Many  parents  who 
forbid  their  children  to  attend  ordinary  sex 
pictures  will  be  glad  to  allow  Junior  and  Mary 
to  see  this  one.    Let's  have  more  of  them. 

Bill  James,  Birmingham,  Ala. 

FROM  THREE  SCHOOL  TEACHERS 

I  was  teaching  a  country  school  twenty-five 
miles  from  a  town,  and  boarding  in  the  house  of 
one  of  my  pupils.  The  stork  visited  the  home 
without  the  aid  of  a  doctor,  and  the  mother 
passed  on  within  the  week. 

The  question  of  feeding  the  child  arose. 
There  was  no  nipple  in  the  house,  but  in  rack- 
ing my  mind  for  something  to  substitute  I  re- 
called how,  in  "His  Woman."  with  Gary 
Cooper  and  Claudette  Colbert,  they  used  an 
old  rubber  glove  and  an  empty  bottle.  It 
worked  fine  as  an  emergency  measure,  and 
baby  went  to  sleep  contented

BU  YS    SOME    STOCKINGS 

AN  ADVERTISING  TALKIE 


CHARACTERS 

Miss  Francis 

A  Realsilk  Representa- 
tive 

A  Call  Boy 


Kay  Francis,  charming  "aristocrat  of  the  screen,"  scored  big  hits 
in  "Street  of  Women"  and  "The  Jewel  Robbery."  Her  most  recent 
success  is  "One  Way  Passage" — All  Warner  Brothers  pictures. 


Realsilk  stockings  reach  you,  on  an  average,  less  than  30  days  after  manufacture, 
due  to  Realsilk's  method  of  selling  direct  from  mills,  eliminating  all  in- 
between  steps  and  delays.  Fresher  silk  is  only  one  of  Realsilk's  seven  ex- 
clusive features.  Sold  only  in  home  or  office — never  in  stores. . . .  Realsilk 
Hosiery  Mills,  Inc. ,  Indianapolis,  Ind.  World's  largest  manufacturer  of  silk 
hosiery.  .  .  .  Branches  in  200  cities.   Listed  in  your  telephone  directory. 


Miss  F.  I've  heard  people  go  into  raptures  over  fresh 
coffee,  fresh  cigarettes,  or  even  fresh  air,  but 
fresh  stockings!  What's  the  point? 

Realsilker  The  same  as  other  fresh  things  — they're  better. 
In  this  case — stronger,  stand  more  strain  — you 
know  what  happens  to  old  silk.  We  can  furnish 
fresh  silk  because  we  sell  direct  — don't  waste 
time  with  a  lot  of  in-between  steps .  .  . 

Miss  F.  (Holding  stocking  to  light.)  Sounds  like  a 
good  idea,  but  take  these  stockings  here. 
They're  deliciously  sheer  — sheer  audacity 
I'd  say  — the  kind  you  have  to  look  at 
twice  to  make  sure  they're  there.  They  may 
be  as  fresh  as  fresh  can  be,  but  what  I  want 
to  know  is 

Realsilker    '  'How  long  will  they  last?  "  isn  't  that  it? 

Miss  F.  Yes,  that's  the  question.  I  suppose  you'll 
tell  me  that  cobwebs  are  strong  as  hammocks 
if  they're  spun  by  fresh  spiders.  .  .  .  Never 
mind,  we  must  have  sheerness.  Legs  are  the 
pillars  of  society  in  Hollywood.  And  truly, 
these  stockings  are  lovely. 

Call  Boy   Two  minutes,  Miss  Francis. 

Realsilker  A  dozen  pairs  of  these  then  — six  in  the  new 
Nomad  shade,  and  six  of  the  Taupe- Mist? 

Miss  F.   Good— and  see  they're  hurried  to  me  fresh. 
—and  She  Does  Buy  Realsilk 

The  most  interesting  part  of  this  advertising  talkie, 
to  us,  is  the  fact  that  Miss  Francis  is  a  regular 
Realsilk  customer  and  very  graciously  permitted 
us  to  use  her  name  and  picture  in  this  manner.

THIS  is  the  little  minx  who  steals  all  the  Hollywood  beaux  and  sets 
glamorous  stars  wondering  how  she  does  it.  Here's  the  secret.  It's 
that  smile.  And  that  cute  Southern  accent.  Yes,  suh.  Having  done 
such  a  good  movie  job  with  Dick  Barthelmess  in  "The  Cabin  in  the 
Cotton,"  Dorothy  Jordan  won  a  splendid  role  in  "70,000  Witnesses" 


IT  could  only  happen  in  pictures — or  to  Clara  Bow.  Who  would  have 
expected  the  rather  plump  and  picture-weary  star  to  emerge  from  her 
desert  ranch,  looking  like  this?  It  is  one  of  the  first  portraits  of  the  new 
Bow,  taken  just  before  her  comeback  picture,  "Call  Her  Savage."  But

REMEMBER  the  grand  job  Eric  Linden  did  as  the  pinch-hit  auto 
racer  in  "The  Crowd  Roars"?  The  lad  has  come  through  since 
in  notable  and  entirely  different  roles  in  "The  Age  of  Consent"  and 
"Life  Begins."  You  can't  type  Eric  except  to  say  he's  a  mighty  con' 
vincing  representative  of  modern  youth.    The  boy  is  just  twenty-three

SWEET  as  a  June  morning  is  this  first  photograph  of  Norma  Shearer, 
waiting  at  the  garden  gate,  in  a  scene  from  "Smilin'  Through." 
Remember  when  Jane  Cowl  created  the  role  on  the  stage,  followed 
by  Norma  Talmadge's  interpretation  in  the  silents?  What  a  change  from 
the  neurotic  heroine  as  we  see  Miss  Shearer  in  "Strange  Interlude"!

Does  she  use  Perfume  because  she  thinks 
that  a  man  may  like  it,  or  does  she  choose 
it  for  the  increased  charm,  the  fresh  glam- 
our, it  brings  herself? 

Clever  women  won't  have  to  answer. 
They  know  that  Perfume  puts  a  delight' 
ful  lilt  into  living.  It  makes  them  feel 
ready  to  greet  Fate  debonairly. 

They  find — in  the  more-than-a'score 
of  exquisite  Perfumes  distilled  by  Coty 
— fragrances  spar\ling  as  the  gay  capital 
of  France,  fresh  as  the  scent  of  lilacs  after 
rain,  sweet  as  the  wind's  breath  over 
Corsican  jasmine  flowers. 

For  certain  moods,  they  select  Coty's 
Chypre — a  bit  of  a  snare;  or  Styx — with 
the  mystery  of  Charon's  troubled  stream. 

But  you  don't  wish  to  be  told  which 
Coty  odeur  is  best  for  you.  In  fact,  we 


shouldn't  tell  you!  Your  own  heart,  your 
awareness  to  Life,  should  help  you  decide. 

And — just  as  you  don't  care  to  express 
the  same  mood  every  day,  every  hour,  in 
every  set,  but  hope  to  play  a  different 
role  to  different  friends — so  you'll  find 
various  Coty  Perfumes  that  properly  in' 
terpret  you:  Perfumes  which  abolish 
boredom,  enhance  vivacity,  renew  allure. 

It  doesn't  take  a  lot  of  money  to  enjoy 
them,  either!  Coty's  fame  is  world'wide, 
and  that  makes  Coty  prices  modest — 
$1.10  to  $27.50.

WHEN  a  prominent  stage  or 
screen  star  comes  to  me  for 
professional  advice,  she  pays  me 
$100  for  each  half  hour  of  instruc- 
tion on  reducing  and  keeping  fit. 

But  in  300  half  hours,  I  could  not 
tell  her  any  more  than  I  can  tell  you 
here,  in  three  minutes.  And  my  plan 
for  reducing  will  cost  you,  not  hun- 
dreds of  dollars  .  .  .  but  just  a  few 
nickels,  plus  your  cooperation  and 
self-control. 

Keeping  trim  and  fit  is  your  job  .  .  . 
not  mine.  I  can  tell  you  how  to  do  it, 
right  plainly  .  .  .  but  it's  up  to  you 
to  get  it  done! 

There  are  only  three  things  impera- 
tive in  any  slenderizing  program. 
I'm  not  going  to  waste  time  on  fancy 
words.  Here's  the  straight-from-the- 
shoulder  tip — 

FIRST:  Exercise  sanely.  Walk  at 
least  a  couple  of  miles  a  day  in  the 
open  air. 

SECOND:  Cut  out  fat  and  rich 
foods— gravies,  sauces  and  liquor, 
absolutely! 

THIRD:  (and  this  is  vital!)  Eat 
enough  sugar!  Yes,  I  mean  it! 
Don't  starve  yourself  on  sweets. 
That's  the  old  idea.  Forget  it.  Here's 
why. 

You'll  actually  lose  weight  faster  if 
you  do  include  sugar  in  your  diet.

fire  of  burning  sugar.  Fat  is  fuel, 
sugar  is  flame.  Without  sugar  to 
burn  up  the  fats,  you  slow  down  the 
loss  of  weight  and  disturb  the  body's 
functions  .  .  .  often  seriously. 

My  own  experience  verifies  these 
facts.  Frankly,  results  have  been 
wonderful.  I  advise  sugar  .  .  .  the 
right  sweet  for  the  right  time.  And 
my  people  lose  weight  faster  and 
they  don't  suffer  the  pangs  of  their 
normal  sweets-hunger.  Nor  grow 
listless  and  irritable  from  loss  of 
energy  due  to  sugar  starvation. 

I  always  include  Life  Savers  with  my 
advice.  They  are  purposeful  candy 
for  your  slenderizing  program.  They 
give  you  the  quickly  assimilated 
sugar  energy  you  must  have  to  re- 
duce without  any  fat  producing  bulk.

They're  hard,  too.  So  you  let  them 
dissolve  slowly  upon  the  tongue. 
They  satisfy  that  sweets-hunger  and 
give  your  body  that  pure  sugar  it 
needs.  Each  Life  Savers  Mint  or 
Fruit  Drop  gives  8  to  10  minutes  of 
"sweets"  satisfaction. 

You  can  find  a  variety  of  enticing 
flavors  at  any  candy  counter.  I  espe- 
cially recommend  the  delicious,  new,

Close-Ups  and  Long-Shots 


JUST  when  the  statement  was  finding  currency 
that  pictures  were  running  in  cycles,  that  they 
covered  much  the  same  background,  were  be- 
coming too  similar  in  theme,  etc.,  the  producers  rang 
for  a  new  deck  of  cards  and  not  a  one  could  call  the 
other's  hand. 

Different— refreshingly  and  brilliantly  different — 
is  this  month's  deal  in  pictures,  as  we'll  show  you 
presently. 

You'll  recall  that  gangster  pictures  ran  hard  on 
the  heels  of  war  films;  that  creepy  horror,  such  as 
"Frankenstein,"  followed  sex,  or  ran  nip  and  tuck 
with  it. 

Of  course  there  were  many  variations  and  over- 
lapping of  one  kind  of  picture  with  another,  but,  on 
the  whole,  the  broad  trend  was  obvious  to  the  most 
casual  movie  patron. 

Grand  entertainment,  much  of  it,  and  the  public 
registered  its  general  approval  at  the  box-office.  How- 
ever, a  trend  that  becomes  a  fetish  can  grow  a  bit 
wearisome. 


BUT  look  over  the  list  of  Photoplay's  starred 
best  in  "The  Shadow  Stage"  for  this  month. 
Theme,  point  of  view,  presentation,  as  you  will  ob- 
serve, entirely  different. 

A  choice  menu.  As  varied  as  a  vaudeville  bill 
ought  to  be.  Running  the  gamut  of  human  emotions 
and  interests. 

You  won't  make  a  mistake  if  you  go  to  them  all, 
for  you  will  find  the  last  as  refreshingly  entertaining 
as  the  first.  That's  good  art  and  good  business,  too. 
Perhaps  the  few  retrousse  nosed  critics  who  still  be- 
lieve only  in  foreign  films  would  like  to  think  that 
one  over. 

There's  a  fundamentally  healthy  tone  to  the  latest 
leading  pictures.  The  humor  may  be  broad,  and  life 
shown  as  tragic,  but  it  is  life — minus  false  psychology, 
melodrama  and  Pollyanna. 


MUCH  of  the  criticism  of  producers  for  their 
selection  of  themes  has,  we  think,  been  unjust. 
Gangster  pictures,  for  example.  These  were  not 
fantasies  of  the  studios.  Rather  they  were  the  ex- 
pression of  the  spirit  of  the  times — what  was  actually 
happening;  what  men  and  women  were  hearing,  seeing, 
thinking  about. 


It  has  always  been  so.  Literature — and  some  of 
the  very  greatest — has  run  in  cycles.  So  with  the 
speaking  stage,  too. 

After  all,  books  and  plays  are  largely  the  interpre- 
tation of  the  life  of  the  moment. 


WHAT  section  of  the  public  takes  its  movie 
fare  most  seriously — that  is,  wants  serious 
stuff?  Well,  according  to  a  census  conducted  by  the 
Will  Hays  office,  it's  the  average  run  of  human  beings. 
And  writers  of  note  turn  to  animated  cartoons.  And 
plain  college  professors  dote  on  Westerns. 

At  any  rate,  now  we  know  what  college  professors 
think  about. 


THOSE  Barry  mores  —  ah,  those  Barrymores! 
What's  happening  on  the  "Rasputin"  set,  any- 
way? Lionel,  John  and  Ethel  have  put  a  touch  of 
the  old  three-ring  circus  into  the  production.  When 
Greek  meets  Greek  there's  trouble,  you  know,  and 
when  three  great  and  temperamental  artists  such  as 
these  foregather,  someone  had  better  look  out. 

On  another  page,  Ruth  Biery  has  given  us  a  vivid 
word  picture  of  the  earlier  rounds.  It's  more  excit- 
ing than  a  radio  announcer  shouting  to  a  waiting 
world  the  details  of  a  fistic  combat. 

Ethel,  though  a  woman,  will  take  odds  from  no  one. 
John  looks  fit,  and  as  for  Lionel,  he  carries  a  cagey 
head  on  those  shoulders.  Director  Charles  Brabin 
is  out  of  the  scene,  and  bold,  brave  Richard  Boleslavsky 
has  thrust  his  head  into  the  lions'  den. 

And  there'll  be  more  about  this — oh,  yes,  indeed — 
quite  a  lot  more! 


O   ASPUTIN"  has  the  basis  for  a  great  picture. 

XVThe  theme  is  of  epic  proportions — autocrats  of 
a  vast  empire — Russia — outwardly  impregnable  before 
the  world — yet  in  the  toils  of  a  man,  half-saint, 
half-lunatic. 

It  is,  perhaps,  the  greatest  opportunity  that  the 
Barrymores  have  ever  faced.  Not  only  have  they 
been  given  roles  that  no  star  would  think  of  refusing, 
but  their  union  in  one  production  is  most  highly 
provocative  of  public  curiosity.  And  we  don't  be- 
lieve the  Barrymores  will  muff  a  triumph  like  this. 
They  are  great  showmen  as  well  as  great  actors.

THE  still,  small  voice  <>f  censorship  continues  t" 
w  hisper  caul  ions  into  t  lit'  ears  of  executives.    For 
example: 

lay  Garnet!  was  directing  a  scene  for  "Okay 
America!"  In  it  Lew  Ayres,  as  the  columnist  hero, 
shoots  a  villainous  gangster. 

The  action  calls  for  Lew  to  mask  his  gun  with  a 
pillow  drape  it  over  the  revolver  and  shoot  from 
the  fold.    Somebody  asked  why  the  pillow. 

"It's  a  'must.'  "'  said  Tay.  "I  can't  show  two  men 
in  the  same  scene  if  there's  to  be  gunplay.  That  is, 
I  can't  show  the  gun.  It's  all  right  to  show  a  fellow 
shooting  and   then   the  effect    of  the  shot.     But  these 

must  be  separate  scenes. 

"In  order  to  gel  both  men  on  the  sereen  at  the 
same  time,  tin-  gun  has  to  he  hidden.  Otherwise  we 
run  into  trouble  with  censorship  hoards  all  over  the 
country." 

Kind  of  silly,  isn't  it? 


GARY  COOPER  has  heen  kidded  a  lot  about  his 
Bond  Street  clothes,  his  Continental  manner  and 
his  new  personality.  And  he  hasn't  hatted  an  eye. 
That's  pretty  good  proof  that  the  kidders  are  all 
wrong,  and  that  the  new  Gary  Cooper  is  not  a  pose 
hut  an  actuality. 

Von  must  remember  that  Gary  was  in  a  run-down 
condition  when  he  made  that  trip  abroad;  that  he 
had  received  some  pretty  hard  emotional  shocks,  and, 
withal,  that  he  never  lay  down  on  his  acting  job. 

He  was  but  a  lad  the  other  day,  and  now  he  has 
returned  with  the  maturity  that  travel  and  even  a 
few  months'  absence  can  impart  to  youth,  which 
changes  fast. 

When  Gary  in  an  interview,  said,  "I'm  Through 
Being  Bossed,"  he  meant  it.  And  you'll  find  on  page 
.'54  of  this  magazine  just  what  was  behind  that  state- 
ment. 


opinion  of  these  two  movie  leaders  happens  to  appear 
at  about  the  same  time,  making,  therefore,  their  com- 
ments worth  noting.  Clair  thinks  that  present 
methods  of  production  submerge  talent  in  both 
directing  and  acting. 

The  upshot  <>f  the  whole  matter  seems  to  be  that 
Clair  is  for  less  business  control  on  the  sets;  Katz  for 
the  most  intelligent  business  control  of  the  industry 
as  a  w  hole. 

It  is  quite  possible  that  the  artist  and  the  practical 
executive  could  get  together  on  the  details. 


WITNESSES  can  be  found  who  will  verify  this, 
they  say.  Anyhow,  it  seems  a  foreigner 
craved  a  wife,  so  he  wrote  out  an  advertisement  and 
placed  it  in  the  newspaper  of  his  little  home-town 
paper  in  the  old  country.  And,  sure  enough,  he 
received  the  picture  of  a  very  beautiful  young  lady 
who  would  marry  him  if  he  would  send  her  the 
passage  money — $500. 

Then  he  sat  down  to  wait.  The  boat  docked  at 
New  York  but  no  blushing  bride-to-be.  So  he  took 
himself  off  to  a  lawyer  to  see  what  could  be  done 
about  it. 

"Let  me  see  the  young  lady's  picture,"  the  lawyer 
said. 

Very  carefully  he  unbuttoned  his  coat  and  took  out 
the  picture,  and  the  lawyer  passed  right  out. 

It  was  a  picture  of  Greta  Garbo. 


A  HOLLYWOOD  writer  tells  this  one  about 
Groucho  Marx's  little  girl.  Groucho  took  her 
to  one  of  the  Olympic  events  and  after  a  race  the 
announcer  said,  "United  States  first,  France  second. 
Argentine  third."  And  then  Groucho's  off-spring 
nudged  her  daddy  and  said:  "Argentine.  Listen  to 
that.     He  means  unguentine. " 


TWO  men  with  outstanding  names  seem  to  differ 
somewhat  as  to  how  pictures  should  be  produced. 
One  is  Sam  Katz,  vice-president  of  Paramount- 
Publix  Corporation;  the  other  is  Rene  Clair,  whom 
French  public  opinion  proclaims  as  the  greatest 
director  in  France. 

In  substance,  Mr.  Katz  believes  that  common- 
sense  business  policy  should  prevail  throughout  the 
industry,  and  that  men  who  know  best  the  public 
reactions  should  have  the  real  say.  Lie  took  his 
viewpoint  as  a  practical  and  successful  exhibitor  right 
into  the  Paramount  Studios  and  stayed  three  months. 
What  he  learned  there  he  undoubtedly  could  have  dis- 
covered in   most   of  the  studios  of    other  companies 


CLAIR  regards  himself,  one  would  conclude  from 
his  statements,  as  an  artist,  and  the  picture- 
making  industry,  as  an  art.  Nothing  new  in  that 
view;   others    have   had    it.      But    the   expression    of 

26 


THE  public  will  take  'em  wild  if  they  are  genuine. 
"Bring    'Em    Back   Alive"   was   a   tremendously 
revealing  film — no  fake,  no  bunk. 

A  topnotch  nature  picture  is  good  box-office.  It's 
in  the  blood.  The  old  cry  on  circus  day  of  "Hold 
your  horses,  the  elephants  are  coming,"  hasn't  lost 
its  thrill. 

Today  we  get  something  more  in  these  big  hunt 
and  exploration  pictures — the  awesome  majesty  of 
the  jungle  and  its  life  laid  bare  before  us. 

And  you  don't  have  to  frame  the  apology,  for  going 
to  see  the  lions  and  monkeys  in  their  cages,  that  it's 
for  little  Johnny's  sake.  You  can  walk  up  brazenly 
and  buy  a  ticket  all  by  yourself.  Though  you'd  be  a 
pretty  mean  dad  and  husband  if  you  didn't  take  the 
kids  and  the  missus  with  you. 

But  there  can  never  he  a  cycle  of  first-class  jungle 
films.     The  genuine  are  too  hard  to  make.

As  I  K 


new 


Hi 


im 


WHENEVER  you  have  enjoyed  in  the  editorial  pages  of 
this  magazine  some  particularly  revealing  glimpses  of 
screen  personalities  whom  you  especially  admire,  you  must 
have  wondered,  too,  just  wnat  sort  of  man  it  was  that, 
through  the  magic  of  his  kindly  pen,  could  make  those  per- 
sonalities as  intimate  to  you  as  they  were  to  him. 

When,  for  example,  he  brought  out  the  fine,  lovable  character 
of  Marie  Dressier  in  such  a  way  as  to  give  you  a  truly  new  un- 
derstanding of  the  greatness  of  the  woman,  or  presented  new 
interpretations  of  Harold  Lloyd,  Douglas  Fairbanks  or  Norma 
Shearer,  then  curiosity  as  to  the  one  who  made  this  pleasure 
possible  for  you  must  have  come  to  you,  at  least  for  a  moment. 

I  cannot  hope  to  write  as  he  wrote,  but  I  can  at  least  try  to 
emulate  the  spirit  in  which  he  shared  his  screen  friendships  with 
you  and  present  to  you  this  little  picture  of  James  R.  Quirk, 
as  I  knew  him. 

I  recall  the  day  about  seventeen  years  ago  when  I  had  not 
been  long  a  member  of  Photoplay's  staff.  Problems  were  con- 
stantly arising  that,  in  my  inexperience,  seemed  perplexingly 
difficult.  He  must  have  guessed  my  doubts  for  his  blue  eyes 
suddenly  took  on  that  snap  and  sparkle  that  they  always  did 
whenever  he  even  so  much  as  heard  the  word  "obstacle." 
"  Look  here,"  he  said,  "this  job  is  pretty  nearly  as  new  to  me  as 
it  is  to  you,  but  you  are  Irish  and  I  am  Irish  and  the  Irish  are 
never  licked.    Together  we  will  fight  this  thing  through." 

I  quote  this  now  because  I  am  sure  you  saw  something  of  that 
same  note  in  his  editorials — that  note  of  buoyancy  and  con- 
fidence and  high-hearted  courage,  that  spirit  that  all  is  well 
with  life  if  we  but  have  the  will  to  face  life  unafraid. 

Life  to  him  was  not  a  grim  thing  to  be  taken  with  a  long  face, 
but  rather  with  a  laugh.  One  of  his  favorite  stories  was  that  of 
a  man  who,  falling  off  a  skyscraper,  in  his  downward  passage 
remarked,  "  I  have  just  passed  the  sixteenth  story.  Everything 
is  safe  so  far."  When  he  had  overcome  some  unusual  difficulty 
he  was  wont  to  say,  "Well,  Kay  Dee,  we  have  just  passed  the 
sixteenth  story  and  we  are  safe  so  far." 

You  who  have  followed  his  editorials  closely  can  understand 
from  that  what  was  behind  that  interplay  of  seriousness  and 


jest,  so  characteristic  of  his  writing.  Yet,  every  jest  he  made 
was  true.  It  so  aptly  expressed  life  as  he  saw  and  interpreted 
it.    He  wrote  as  he  did  because  his  style  was  the  man  himself. 

He  was  able  to  write  about  human  nature  so  truthfully  and 
so  sympathetically  because  of  his  own  lovable  character  and 
understanding  of  the  deep  wells  of  the  human  heart.  Those  at 
the  foot  of  fortune's  ladder,  though  perhaps  we  do  not  know  it, 
are  our  shrewdest  critics.  The  faces  of  errand  boys  and  elevator 
operators  brightened  when  Mr.  Quirk  approached.  The  man 
who  can  elicit  such  a  greeting  has,  in  generous  measure,  a 
common  human  touch.  It  means  he  can  understand  and  make 
allowances  for  other's  weaknesses  and  failings. 

And  he  was  that  fair  and  square  in  his  dealings  with  every- 
body. Do  you  wonder  that  one  of  his  intimates  said  of  him, 
"He  never  had  a  friend  he  could  lose;  or  an  enemy  he  couldn't"? 

I  think,  too,  his  relations  with  his  working  staff  well  define 
another  outstanding  phase  of  his  personality.  He  drew  to  him- 
self, as  by  a  magnet,  a  singularly  strong  personnel — men  and 
women  quick  to  comprehend  his  policies  and  to  execute  them. 
Through  the  years  they  have  been  with  him — rejecting  tempt- 
ing offers  from  other  publishers — welded  into  a  highly  efficient, 
smoothly  running  organization.  And  his  own  warm  heart  in- 
culcated loyalty,  enthusiasm  and  fighting  initiative. 

He  kept  no  publishing  or  editorial  methods  a  secret  from 
them.  Once  when  he  was  absent  for  several  months,  his  mag- 
azine continued  to  express  the  very  essence  of  his  own  editorial 
self.  A  friend  complimented  him  on  the  contents  of  his  latest 
issue.  "I  can  see  you  all  the  way  through  it,  Jimmie."  He 
laughed.  "  My  staff  is  like  poor,  old  Cyrano  de  Bergerac.  He 
did  the  singing,  you  remember,  while  his  friend  won  the  lady's 
kisses.  I  hadn't  read  a  line  in  that  magazine  until  it  was  off  the 
press.  I  have  taught  them  all  to  be  editors.  Every  one  of  them 
is  my  understudy." 

A  generous  policy  that,  and  a  wise  one,  for  the  spirit  that 
made  him  so  great  an  editor  and  publisher  still  marches  on  with 
his  staff.

Mad  Monk.  Lionel  gives  brother  John  his 
apostolic  blessing.  But  that  glare  in  the  Barry- 
more  eye  is  not  religious  frenzy.  Just  wait 
till  those  two  get  out  of  the  camera's  range 


("Rasputin"  may  be  fated  to  become  a  directors' 
nightmare.  As  we  go  to  press,  word  is  received  that 
Charles  Brabin  will  no  longer  be  in  command.  When 
you  read  this  story,  perhaps  you  can  guess  why.) 

THEY  needed  a  Lion  Tamer  for  "Grand  Hotel." 
Someone  who  could  crack  the  whip  and  make 
seven,  unrelated,  high-strung  human  animals 
work  as  though  they  were  "brothers  and 
sifters." 

"Grand  Hotel,"  and  the  success  Tamer  Goulding 
made  of  whip-cracking,  is  now  history. 

But  more  history  is  in  the  making.  "Rasputin"  is 
in  production  with  the  throe  Barrymores — Ethel, 
Lionel  and  John-  in  the  three  starring  roles. 

They  needed  a  referee  this  lime — not  a  lion  tamer. 
A  diplomat  to  negotiate  treaties.  The  problem  here 
was  to  persuade  the  Barry- 
mores  to  forget  that  they  are 
"brothers  and  sister.  " 

They  chose  Charlie  Brabin. 

We  have  a  sneaking  suspi- 
cion that  Boss  Barrymore  had  a 
hand  in  that  selection.  Lionel 
to  you,  now  but  Boss  by  the 
time  this  story  is  finished. 


Czarina  Ethel 
prays.  And  what  do 
you  think  those 
saintly  lips  are  say- 
ing? You  wouldn't 
believe  it  if  we  told 
you.  So  read  the 
story    to    find    out

Can  Directors  Break  the  Barrymore  Clinches? 


The  glory  that  was  the  Romanoffs.  Here  we  behold  the  awesome  majesty 
of  the  Russian  imperial  family  that  was  destined  for  one  of  history's 
greatest  tragedies.     "Rasputin"  is  a  grand  panorama  of  regal  pomp  and  splendor 


You  remember  the  remark  he  made 
when  he  heard  the  three  of  them  were  to 
work  together. 

"And  who's  the  poor  son-of-a-gun 
that's  got  to  direct  us!" 

Boss  Lionel  made  "The  Washington 
Masquerade"  with  Brabin.  He  had 
found  his  man. 

I  think  he  probably  made  his  decision 
the  day  he  did  not  hear  Brabin  call 
"camera."  Lionel  was  waiting  for  his 
cue  to  enter  with  Karen  Morley.  They 
stood  arm  in  arm  at  the  entrance. 

Brabin  called  once.  He  called  twice. 
Karen  started;  stopped.  Lionel  had  not 
moved.  He  couldn't.  He  was  sound 
asleep — standing  up. 

Brabin  didn't  scold;  he  didn't  laugh. 
He  acted  as  though  nothing  unusual  had 
happened. 

IF  a  man  could  act  as  though  nothing 
had  happened  when  one  Barrymore 
pulled  a  Barrymore  stunt,  perhaps  he 
would  not  notice  when  three  Barrymores 
did  a  family  act. 

It  was  worth  trying. 

And  just  as  the  powers-that-be  at 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  attempted  to 
keep  Goulding's  whip-cracking  a  secret, 
so  they  are  struggling  to  shroud  the 
diplomatic  genius  of  Brabin  behind  the 
soft,  silken  curtains  of  executive  and 
publicity  offices: 

"Never  saw  three  people  work  so 
beautifully  together.  We  had  no  idea 
brothers  and  sisters  could  be  so  lov- 
able-" 

They  had  only  been  in  production  a 
short  time  when  this  was  written,  but 
that's  time  enough  to  give  us  a  hint  of 


Nope,  this  isn't  an  auto  accident 
and  the  man  with  the  helmet  isn't 
one  of  those  funny  foreign  police- 
men. Little  Tad  Alexander 
(Czarevitch  to  you)  is  only  figur- 
ing out  a  way  to  steal  another 
scene    from  the  Barrymore  gang 


what  may  be  expected.  Read  this  for 
proof: 

A  room  which  is  small  for  a  Russian 
castle.    Bare;  cold;  austerely  simple. 

A  shrine  in  one  corner.  A  real  ikon 
— one  of  the  true  relics  of  the  Church  of 
the  Romanoffs  smuggled  into  the  Holly- 
wood Russian  Colony  by  an  aristocratic 
refugee  and  sold  to  a  pawn-shop. 
Rented  by  Metro. 

At  this  shrine — the  Czarina.  Ethel. 
On  her  knees,  hands  supplicatingly  ex- 
tended toward  Saint  Gregory.  Her  lips 
move  in  silent  prayer.  She  is  whisper- 
ing her  invocation  that  the  life  of  her 
son,  Alexis,  be  saved. 

IT  is  the  first  take  of  the  picture  and 
Ethel's  first  appearance  before  a  talk- 
ing picture  camera.  An  auspicious 
occasion.  The  knee  of  the  last  aristo- 
crat of  the  stage  is  bended  before  the 
god  of  modern  entertainment — the  cam- 
era. 

This  is  a  silent  shot.  The  cameras 
grind  but  the  sound  apparatus  stands 
still. 

She  prays.  Her  lips  move  although 
no  words  come  from  them.  There  is 
absolute  silence. 

Suddenly,  without  warning,  a  noise. 
A  man  in  the  rear  of  the  room  has 
commenced  talking.  A  man  is  chatting 
while  the  Queen  of  the  Stage  holds  the 
concentrated  attention  of  director  and 
cameramen. 

Ethel's  lips  no  longer  move  in  silent 
invocation.  Words  come  distinctly  from 
those  saintly  lips.  Words  which  are 
deep,   throaty — pitched  into  that  cold

That  long-lost  wealthy  un- 
cle need  no  longer  worry 
you.  Just  ask  Jackie 
Merkle.  He  exposes  every- 
one's secrets  as  easily  as 
a  magician  pulls  rabbits 
out  of  a  hat.  Here  Helen 
Twelvetrees  is  getting  the 
low-down    on    her   future 


Jackie  Tells  Everythin 


THE  strangest  phenomenon  in  a  town  of  strange  happen- 
ings. A  boy.  normal,  a  little  bit  good  and — well,  more 
than  a  little  bit  bad,  who  has  caused  more  thrills,  more 
chills,  more  open-mouthed  wonder,  than  any  machine- 
made  Dr.  Jekyll,  Dr.  X,  or  Vampire  Dracidas  in  Hollywood. 

Not  quite  five  years  old,  short  and  chubby,  with  a  head  of 
riotous  curls,  he's  the  only  person  that  can  walk  onto  a  movie 
sel  and  stop  production. 

Time,  money,  deadline,  mean  nothing  when  Jackie  Merkle 
steps  a  baby  step  onto  a  movie  lot. 

For  he  has  out-thrilled  Hollywood.  He  has  beat  them  at 
their  own  game.    The  sensation  in  a  sensational  town. 

Unable  to  read  or  write,  he  tells  every  star,  feature  player, 
extra  and  electrician  their  names,  their  birthplaces,  their  hopes 
for  the  future  and — here's  where  Hollywood  gasps  a  huge, 
gurgling  gasp — little  unknown  things  about  themselves  and 
tluir  lives  they  had  imagined  locked  firmly  from  a  prying  world. 

Clasping  his  father's  hand,  he  stepped 
onto  a  sound  stage  at  First  National  studios. 
High  above,  on  a  platform,  Richard  Arlen, 
electricians,  director  and  workmen,  were 
busy  on  '    Tiger  Shark." 

The  boy  spied  a  small  camera  dolly  and, 
boy-like,  he  made  for  it  like  a  shot. 

"  The  man's  name  up  there  with  the  cap, 
Jackie?''  the  father  asked. 

Without  a  backward  glance  the  boy  called 
an  unknown  electrician's  name  and  went 
on  with  his  playing,  while  an  amazed  work- 
man swallowed  twice  and  gulped  once. 

Richard  Arlen  came  down.  "The  watch 
in  your  pocket,"  Jackie  said  in  answer  to 
the  question,  screwing  and  unscrewing  a

wheel  on  the  dolly,  "is  a  Longinnes.  It  was  made  in  Switzer- 
land. Look  how  this  wheel  turns,  daddy.  Your  wife's  name?'' 
He  hesitated  at  this,  looking  off  into  the  distance  for  a  moment. 
'It's  Job}- — no,  it's  Jobyna  Ralston.  And  the  thing  you  were 
worrying  about?    Oh,  you  signed  that  yesterday.  " 

And  someone  helped  a  limp  and  puzzled  Mr.  Arlen  to  a 
nearby  chair. 

PRODUCTION  had  stopped.  Down  the  stairs  trooped  open- 
mouthed  electricians.  The  director,  in  the  midst  of  an  animated 
conversation,  stopped  in  surprise  and  joined  the  trek  down- 
ward. Eddie  Robinson  came  stealing  out  of  his  dressing-room, 
peering  at  the  child  at  play. 

They  stood  there.  An  average  crowd  of  Hollywood  workers. 
And  with  the  greatest  ease,  he  told  them  what  they  asked,  still 
playing,  boy-like,  at  the  dolly. 

"What's  the  name  of  the  city  I  just  wrote  down,  Jackie?" 
Eddie  Robinson  asked. 

"Constantinople,"  Jackie  chirped  and 
with  a  little  twinkle  in  his  brown  eyes  he 
looked  up  from  his  play  and  said,  "You 
were  going  to  write  down  Bucharest  only 
you  thought  it  was  too  hard  for  me, 
didn't  you?" 

And  Little  Caesar,  who  could  dish  it  out, 
still  couldn't  take  it !  He  stood  there  among 
that  group  and  just  looked,  and  looked, 
while  production  waited. 

"The  name  of  the  yacht  you're  going 
away  on  is  Infanta/'  he  told  Doug  Fair- 
banks, Jr.,  in  the  studio  dining-room. 

"Oh,  yeah?"  Doug  grinned,  looking  up 
from  his  lunch.  [  please  turn  to  page  100  ] 


Consolation  Marriage: 


Well- 
Hardly! 


By 

Ka  t  he  rine 

Albert 


I  FIRMLY  believe  that  the  most  fascinating  story  in 
Hollywood  is  the  one  about  Bill  Boyd  and  Dorothy 
Sebastian.  When  I  think  about  those  folks  I  have  to 
stop  a  minute  to  brush  aside  a  sentimental  tear. 

For,  set  right  down  in  the  turmoil  and  activity,  the 
rumor  and  ruthlessness  of  Hollywood  are  two  perfectly 
happy  and  contented  people. 

You  would  have  to  know  the  strange  hybrid  life,  with 
its  shams  and  its  deceits,  that  can  be  lived  in  Hollywood 
to  know  what  that  means.  And  you  would  have  to  know 
both  Dorothy  and  Bill  before  their  marriage  to  realize 
how  strange  it  is  that,  with  all  the  odds  against  them, 
they  have  accomplished  such  a  perfect  relationship.  How 
they  have  accomplished  it  is  a  lesson  that  no  young 
married  couple,  or  any  girl  or  boy  about  to  be  married, 
can  afford  to  miss. 

In  the  first  place  there  was  Dorothy — "little  Alabam'  " — 
one  of  the  craziest  kids  who  ever  set  foot  on  studio  stage. 
Oh,  you  loved  her  to  death,  and  all  the  time  you  wanted 
to  give  her  a  good  brisk  shaking  that  would  make  her  teeth 
rattle,  for  you  knew  how  desperately  she  needed  to  be  happy 
and  that  she  hadn't  the  foggiest  notion  of  how  to  go  about  it. 

She  thought  her  happiness  lay  in  gayety  and  dancing  and 
staying  up  until  late  hours.  And  then  she  thought  she  could 
find  what  she  sought  by  playing  the  social  game  and  meeting 
the  right  people.  She  had  known  a  great  deal  of  bitterness  in 
her  life — her  first  marriage  had  been  a  tragic  one — and  she 
believed  the  way  to  for- 
get was  to  live  so  fast 
she  did  not  have  time 
to  remember. 

While  Dorothy  was 
working  at  M-G-M  and 
being  about  as  unhappy 
as  it  is  possible  for  one 
human  being  to  be, 
there  was  a  fellow 
named  Bill  Boyd  work- 
ing at  the  Pathe  Studios 
not  far  away.  They 
had  never  met  and  I'm 
sure  if  Bill  had  known 
Dorothy  then  he 
wouldn't  have  liked  her 
very  much,  for  Bill  had 
realized  for  a  long  time 
where  happiness  was  to 
be  found  and  he  knew 
it  wasn't  in  the  stay- 
up-late  places. 


— Bill  was  sad,  too.  But 
Dorothy  brought  the 
smile  back  to  his  face 


Dorothy  Sebastian  met  Bill  Boyd 
when  another  love  was  in  eclipse — 


Bill  hated  the  social  game  as  much  as  Dorothy  thought  she 
loved  it,  and  his  chief  delight  was  sitting  around  with  a  few  old 
cronies  talking  comfortable,  lazy  talk.  At  that  time  Bill  was 
married  to  Elinor  Fair — they  had  met  as  both  were  climbing 
to  success  in  "Volga  Boatman"  and  the  romance  had  grown 
then — but  the  years  had  set  them  apart  and  neither  was  any 
too  happy.    A  divorce  was  imminent. 

It  was  shortly  after  Bill's  and  Elinor's  separation  that  he  and 
Dorothy  met.  Dorothy  made  a  picture  with  Bill  only  a  little 
while  after  her  engagement  to  Director  Clarence  Brown  took  a 
complete  nose  dive.  One  day  she  started  to  tell  Bill  all  about 
it.  He  didn't  say  much — he  never  does,  but  he  was  intuitive 
enough  to  know  that  the  hard  look  in  Dorothy's  eyes  and  her 
set  grim  mouth  were  indications  of  unhappiness  and  so,  because 
he  was  lonely  too,  there  sprang  up  a  very  real  friendship. 

THE  first  time  I  saw  Bill  was  out  at  Dorothy's  little  house 
in  Brentwood.  Dorothy  was  in  a  mess  of  trouble — as  she 
usually  was  then — and  I  watched  Bill  as  she  told  me  the 
story.  He  never  took  his  eyes  from  her  face  and  when  she  had 
finished  he  said,  "Now,  don't  you  worry,  honey,  I'm  going  to 
take  care  of  all  that."  I  looked  at  Dorothy.  It  was  the  first 
time  that  a  man  had  ever  assured  her  of  his  protection.  Before, 
she  had  done  everything  for  herself  and  by  herself. 

I  remember  later  that  I  told  Dorothy,  "He's  a  swell  guy  and 
if  I  were  you  I'd  hang  on  to  him." 

"Yes.  I  like  him  a  lot,"  Dot  said,  "but  he  doesn't  like  to  go 
to  parties  and  to  dances  and  to  premieres.  He's  crazy  about 
getting  out  on  the  ocean  in  a  boat  and  just  cruising  around. 
And  he  likes  to  go  up  in  the  mountains  camping.  I  don't  think 
I  could  stand  it.     My  favorite    [  please  turx  to  page  106  ]

When  Nero  Was  Tyrant — on  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross'     Set 


TIM  magnificence  of  imperial  Rome 
spring  to  life  once  more  at  the  command 
of  Dire*  tc  D(   Mille.    Love,  hate. 

gl«4nfft,«    and     sorrow,    poverty    and     wealth, 
cruelty  and  kindness  are  depicted  as  with  us 

today  even  as  then. 

The  old  Stage  play  of  "The  Sign  of  the 
Cross,"  which  moved  to  terror  hundreds  of 
thousands  of  theater-goers,  is  given  a  new 
interest  by  characteristically  De  Millean 
twists.        Here      PHOTOPLAY'S     photographer 


shows  you  a  small  section  of  three  ancient 
Roman  city  blocks — apartments,  shops,  bazaars 
and  transportation  slipped  back  nearly  2,000 
years  on  these  traffic -jammed  streets. 

You  are  in  the  year  64  a.  D.  now  and  that 
plumed  figure  in  the  chariot  isn't  Fredric 
March,  but  the  Roman  Prefect;  Claudette 
Colbert  is  really  the  wanton-eyed  Empress 
Pop  pant,  and  Hlissa  Landi,  the  Christian  girl. 

But  the  story  is  largely  up-to-date — a  par- 
allel between  the  present  and  the  past.     And 


the  story  itself  is  always  new — a  story  of  great 
sacrifice  and  love,  threatened  by  the  reckless- 
ness and  cruel  jealousies  of  those  in  power. 

It  is  a  tense  moment  for  De  Mille  and  his 
aides-de-camp — Mitchell  Lersen,  art  director 
(leaning  over);  Jimmie  Dugan,  assistant 
director  (white  shirt);  Karl  Struss,  head 
cameraman  (with  glasses);  George  Clemens, 
first  cameraman. 

Will  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross"  be  De  Mille's 
masterpiece?

*  1 1 1  \"  Gary  Cooper 
returned  to  Holly- 
wood from  his 
amazing  trip  to 

Europe  and  points  Mast  with 
his  Bond  Street  clothes,  his  de- 
cidedly Continental  manner 
and  his  debonair  attitude,  Hol- 
lywood gasped  a  couple  of 
times  and  then  did  what  I  [oily- 
wood  always  does — began  ask- 
ing itself  questions. 

What's  happened  to  Gary? 

What  is  this  strange  change 
that  has  come  over  the  strong, 
silent  lad  from  Montana? 

And  when  Gary,  the  affable, 
kicked  up  a  bit  of  a  row  at  the 
studio  over  playing  "  Devil  and 

the  Deep,"  because  he  said  it  was  a  woman's  picture  and 
wouldn't  give  him  a  fair  chance  and  was  only  persuaded  to  act 
in  the  film  when  he  was  definitely  promised  "A  Farewell  to 
Arms''  -well,  Hollywood's  eyes  stood  out  on  stems.  Why, 
Gary  had  never  acted  like  that  before.  Gary  had  always  done 
exactly  as  he  was  told — without  saying  a  word! 

Which  is  just  the  point.  Gary  has  stopped  doing  what  he  is 
told.    He  is  a  new  Gary  Cooper. 

Gone  is  the  gaunt,  melancholy,  forlorn  lad  over  whom  women 
languished  and  cooed,  "He  looks  as  if  he  has  suffered."  And 
in  that  boy's  place  stands  an  assured,  poised,  grown-up  man 
who  thinks  for  himself  and  meets  the  world  upon  its  own  terms. 
He  has  lost  even  his  gauntness.  His  face  has  filled  out  and  his 
figure  straightened.  Eleven  months  away  from  Hollywood  has 
wrought  the  change. 

'"I  was  licked  when  I  left  Hollywood,"  he  told  me.  ''Sunk. 
Washed  up.  I  was  ill.  I  had 
been  working  day  and  night.  I 
was  unhappy  about  the  way 
things  were  going  at  the  studio. 
My  private  affairs  had  reached 
a  crisis.  ...  I  had  an  attack 
of  jaundice,  which  is  a  terribly 
depressing  thing,  anyhow. 
And  with  all  these  other  things 
on  my  mind — well,  it  was 
pretty  awful! 


'T  SHALL  never  get  into  such 
-i-  a  state,  mentally,  again. 
Life  can  never  do  anything  like 
that  to  me  again.  I  have 
learned  something.  .  .  . 

"In  the  first  place,  I  shall 
never  be  dominated  by  other 
people  again  as  I  had  allowed 
myself  to  be  until  that  time.  I 
had  drifted,  taken  advice,  let 
people  get  at  me  through  my 
emotions,  my  sympathy,  my 
affections.  Perhaps  through  a 
sort  of  apathy,  too,  because  I 
was  not  well.  You  don't  real- 
ize the  hold  you  are  letting 
people  get  on  you  until  you  find 
yourself  enmeshed  and  en- 
tangled and  helpless.  You  have 
to  shake  yourself  free  and  begin 
all  over  again.  It  isn't  easy!

Gary's  mother  is  a  charming,  conservative 
woman.  Loving  her  boy,  she  tried  her  best 
to  shield  him.  But  Gary  discovered  that 
he    had    to    do   his   thinking    for    himself 


toward  my  work  has  changed. 
You  are  right.  It  isn't  as  im- 
portant to  me  as  it  used  to  be. 
And,  therefore,  I  shall  do  bet- 
ter at  it.  I  shall  have  a  per- 
spective on  it.  I  can  examine 
my  problems  reasonably  and  in 
a  detached  manner  because  I 
am  no  longer  blinded  by  the 
glamour  of  pictures.  (I  have 
learned  that  it  is  no  use  to  have 
ideas  unless  you  express  them.) 
And  that  no  one  will  have  any 
respect  for  your  ideas  unless 
you  are  willing  to  fight  for 
them.  The  initial  plunge  into 
expressing  them  and  fighting 
for  them  is  the  hardest! 

"  When  I  returned  to  New 
York  after  my  trip  abroad,  they  told  me  that  things  would  be 
different  for  me  out  here.  That  things  would  be  arranged  to 
my  advantage.  Well — when  I  came  back,  things  weren't  dif- 
ferent. I  had  been  meek  for  so  long,  had  done  just  as  I  was 
told  for  so  long,  that  no  one  could  believe  that  I  wouldn't  con- 
tinue to  do  it.  They  took  vie  for  granted.  That  is  bad — very- 
bad — for  you  in  a  career,  in  your  relations  with  your  family — 
or  in  love.  Never  let  anyone  take  your  amiability  and  your 
pliability  for  granted!" 

DID  I  tell  you  that  Gary  had  grown  up?  It  hasn't  been  easy 
for  the  slow,  easy-going,  inarticulate  Gary  to  learn  that 
lesson  of  self-assertion.  He  was  as  dreamy,  as  impractical,  as 
amiable  a  chap  as  you  would  imagine.  He  w  as  a  quiet  child 
and  his  sweet,  dignified,  conservative  parents  adored  him  and 
gave  him  all  their  anxious,  clinging  attention. 

The  women  in  his  life  have 
dominated  him.  Clara  Bow. 
Evelyn  Brent.  Then  the  re- 
doubtable Lupe.  When  that 
fiery  little  Mexican  swooped 
upon  his  heart,  there  began  a 
stormy  time  for  Gary.  The 
worshipping'  mother — deeply 
concerned  about  the  results  of 
this  impetuous  romance — and 
the  primitive  child-woman  who 
enthralled  him  could  never, 
never  have  reached  a  glimmer- 
ing of  mutual  understanding  or 
sympathy. 

Although  I  think  they  both 
tried  at  first.  Gary  loved 
them  both  and  their  feminine 
tug-of-war  over  the  mastery  of 
his  affections  must  have  torn 
him  nearly  to  ribbons! 

He  tried  to  please  every- 
body. His  producers,  Evelyn 
Brent,  Clara  Bow,  Lupe  Yelez, 
his  mother  and  his  father — who 
was  forever  investing  his 
money  for  him.  He  tried  to 
please  even  those  friends  who 
were  continually  advising  him. 
And  when  he  didn't  please 
he  was  baffled  rather  than  dis- 
illusioned. Like  a  small  boy 
who  has  been  spanked  for 
something  he  cannot  under- 
stand.

HEAVE  a  sigh  of  relief,  you  Garbo  fans.

about  the  plans  of  the  Glamorous  One  and 
right  away  quick,  just  to  make  you  feel  better, 
we'll  tell  you  that  she'll  be  making  more 
American  movies. 

Here's  the  low-down,  but  don't  ever  tell  a 
soul  we  told  you.  Before  sin-  left  lor  Sweden 
she  signed  a  new  M-G-M  contract  at  a  salary

upon  the  number  of  weeks  she  works.  She'll  be 
hack  to  begin  that  contract  in  October. 

Wait,  wait,  we  aren't  through!  Her  first 
picture  will  be  "Christina"  and  the  scenario 
writers  are  at  work  right  this  minute  adapting 
it  for  her.  The  yarn  is  based  on  a  historical 
character — a   Swedish  queen   who   renounced

her  throne  for  love.     My,  my,  can't  you  just 
see  Garbo  tossing  that  one  off? 

It  will  be  a  costume  movie,  of  course. 

Now — is  everybody  happy? 

rT"'HF  most  exciting  news  of  the  month  was 
Ruth  Chatterton's  sudden  marriage  to 
George  Brent. 

Sudden?  Of  course,  nobody  in  Hollywood 
was  surprised,  but  the  fact  remains  that  Ruth's 
divorce  from  Ralph  Forbes  was  gotten  just  a 
few  hours- before  she  stood  beside  George  and 
made  those  vows! 

When  Ruth  returned  from  Europe  she  was 
pleasant  but  as  silent  as  Garbo's  set  during  a 
tense  scene.  She  couldn't,  so  she  told  re- 
porters, announce  her  engagement  to  George 
because  she  wasn't  sure  at  the  time  whether  she 
was  still  Mrs.  Ralph  Forbes  or  not.    The  very 


next  day  she  became  Mrs.  George  Brent  at  a 
quiet  little  wedding  ceremony  in  Westchester 
County,  not  far  from  Xew  York. 

Folks  who  know  the  members  of  that  triangle 
intimately  are  shouting  lustily  for  joy.  Ralph 
is  a  grand  fellow — but  not  for  Ruth.  She 
mothered  him  too  much.  But  you  can't 
imagine  anybody  mothering  big  George  Brent, 
can  you? 

Brent  likes  the  things  Ruth  likes — goofy 
things  like  going  to  the  amusement  beaches 
and  riding  the  roller  coasters  and  eating  hot 
dogs — all  smeared  up  with  mustard. 

George  will  be  the  boss  in  that  home — and 
don't  make  any  mistake  about  it.  But  Ruth 
will  love  it — and  don't  make  any  mistake  about 
that,  either. 

From  where  we  sit  it  looks  like  the  real 
McCoy. 


The  fact  remains  that  Michael  was  all  set  to  play  a 
role  in  Gloria's  new  English-made  film — but  then 
decided  that  he  was  a  better  husband  than  actor

"Who  was  that  lady  I  seen  you  with?"  somebody 
asked  this  be-spectacled  gentleman.  And  his  answer 
was  "That  wasn't — I  mean  that  was  Greta  Garbo  and 
also  my  sister."  This  informal  snap  of  the  glamorous 
one  and  her  brother  was  taken  in  Sweden  recently. 
But  Garbo  is  going  to  make  more  American  pictures 


TF  you  take  the  girl  friend  out  to  lunch  and 

begin  by  knocking  over  water  glasses  and  up- 
setting coffee  cups,  don't  be  embarrassed.  It's 
love.  At  least,  it  was  love  with  George  Brent 
and  Ruth  Chatterton. 

Their  first  scene  together  in  "The  Rich  Are 
Always  With  Us"  called  for  a  tete-a-tete  tea  and 
poor  George  upset  everything  on  his  side  of  the 
table  and  Ruth  reciprocated  by  knocking 
everything  off  her  side  into  George's  lap. 

And  that's  how  they  knew  that  very  minute 
it  was  love  at  first  sight,  Mr.  Brent  states. 

Normally,  Miss  Chatterton  seldom  pours 
coffee  into  a  gentleman's  lap.  And  there  you 
are.    Or,  rather,  there  George  and  Ruth  are. 

TDROMPTLY    at    six    o'clock    one    evening, 

Virginia  Bruce  stepped  from  the  sound  stage 

of  "Kongo"  on  the  M-G-M  lot,  walked  over  to 


her  dressing  room,  removed  the  brown  grease 
paint  from  her  face  and  the  costume  for  the 
picture,  donned  a  simple  black  crepe  dress 
with  white  puffed  sleeves,  walked  over  to  Jack 
Gilbert's  dressing  room  bungalow  and,  with  no 
more  fuss  or  feathers,  became  the  fourth  Mrs. 
John  Gilbert.    And  are  they  happy! 

Irving  Thalberg  was  best  man  and  Mrs. 
Donald  Stewart  matron  of  honor.  There  were 
a  few  guests,  Norma  Shearer  among  them. 

The  next  morning,  promptly  at  eight,  little 
Mrs.  Gilbert  was  back  on  the  "Kongo"  set 
hard  at  work.  And  a  Hollywood  that  scoffed 
at  their  engagement  and  called  it  a  publicity 
stunt,  is  looking  rather  sheepish. 

'  I  'HERE  are  only  two  green  Dusenberg  cars 

in  Hollywood  and  one  of  them  belongs  to 

Gary  Cooper.     And  so,  when  a  certain  green 


Dusenberg  was  parked  nightly  before  Lupe 
Velez's  home,  Hollywood  hit  the  ceiling  with 
excitement. 

"Lupe  and  Gary  are  together  again,"  the 
news  flashed. 

But  imagine  their  embarrassment  when  it 
was  discovered  that  the  other  green  Dusenberg 
belonged  to  no  one  but  Lupe  herself,  and  the 
parked  car  was  her  own,  not  Gary's. 

A  CERTAIN  producer  was  read- 
■^^  ing  a  chatter  column  in  which  it 
was  said  the  public  preferred  seeing 
William  Powell  and  Kay  Francis 
vis-a-vis* 

"Well,"  the  producer  snorted, 
"they  can  show  Powell  and  Francis 
vis-a-vis  if  they  choose,  but  as  for 
me,    I'll   keep   my    stars   clothed."

Irving  Lippmun 


This  is  the  lad  whom  George 
Arliss  singled  out  as  a  young 
man  of  exceptional  acting 
ability.  Hollywood  girls  like 
him,  too.  A  few  months  ago 
Photoplay  told  you  that 
the  kid  had  great  screen 
promise,  so  Hardie  Albright 
just  had  to  live  up  to  expecta- 
tions. You'll  see  him  next  in 
"20,000  Years  in  Sing  Sing." 
It's  a  grand  job  he  does 


"TTALLULAH    BANKHEAD    and    Marlene 

■*■  Dietrich  got  off  to  a  bad  start.  They 
ipenly  ignored  one  another.  Marlene  was  the 
bit;  star  already  well  established,  and  not  eager 
to  share  her  Paramount  throne  with  anybody. 
Tallulah  had  not  made  so  many  or  such  suc- 
cessful pictures  as  Marlene,  but  she  had  a  big 
stage  reputation. 

But  now  they're  buddies.    And  you  ought  to 
hear  one  rave  about  the  other. 

A  MOVIE  actress,  her  near  ex- 
"^^  husband  and  her  new  fiance, 
were  on  their  way  to  a  party. 

The  wife  began  fussing  about 
which  car  they  should  go  in. 

"For  heaven's  sake,"  the  fiance 
said  to  the  husband,  "can't  you  make 
her  stop  fussing?" 

"Oh,  no,"  said  the  husband,"that's 
your  job  now." 

A  LTIIOUGH    the    newspapers   announced 
*-that  the  Clark  Gables  bought  that  swanky 

house  in  Beverly  Hills,  Clark  says  they're  just 

renting. 

His  wife  had  her  furniture  sent  on  from  New 

York  because  they  figured  it  was  cheaper  to 

rent  unfurnished. 

For  the  Gables  are  wise  folks  and  are  saving 

their  money.     Eventually,  they're  going  to  do 

a  lot  of  traveling. 

tANET  GAYXOR'S  hair  has  at  last  grown 
J  out  to  its  full  length.  You  remember  that  she 
had  to  let  it  grow  because  all  her  fans  raised 
such  a  howl  when  she  got  a  short  bob.  Those 
were,  however,  pinned-on  curls  that  you  saw  in 


"The  First  Year."  They  couldn't  wait  for  the 
hair  to  grow  when  time  came  to  start  the 
picture. 

But  no  more  artifice  from  now  on.  Janet  is 
back — and  is  that  unsophisticated  little  "7th 
Heaven"  girl  you  love. 

TN  a  town  literally  one  great  pattern  of  un- 
usual and  gorgeous  homes,  along  comes 
Ramon  Xovarro  with  one  that  takes  the  cream 
for  originality.  You  know  Ramon  has  always 
prided  himself  on  living  in  a  plain,  modest 
house  in  the  conservative  West  Adams  section 
of  Los  Angeles.  Xo  typical  Hollywood  stuff 
for  him — but  now  he  has  broken  loose  with  a 
bang  and  built  a  house  like  none  other  ever 
seen  in  those  there  parts. 

The  home  is  perched  on  a  hidden  hill  which 
can  be  reached  only  by  winding  and  turning 
roads.  Built  on  five  levels,  it  is  trimmed  on 
the  outside  with  bands  of  wrought  copper 
against  white  stucco. 

Ramon  has  two  rooms  of  his  own  to  fit  his 
mood  of  the  moment — or  something.  One  is 
done  in  soft  greens  and  opens  onto  a  private 
swimming  pool. 

The  other  is  on  top  of  the  house  and  has 
glass  walls — honest! 

The  dining  room  is  all  in  black  and  chromium 
with  a  long  black  glass  table  and  there  are  no 
pictures  on  the  walls,  but  plenty  of  lovely 
porcelain  that  Ramon  brought  from  Europe. 
To  date  it  is  the  most  bizarre  house  in  Holly- 
wood, and  are  certain  stars  biting  their  glisten- 
ing finger  nails  in  envy!  But  we  can't  help 
wondering  what  Ramon's  Mexican  mother  and 
all  his  Mexican  brothers  and  sisters  think 
about  it.

•"THE  first  sparks  a  re  beginning  to  fly  from  the 
"  Rasputin"  set  with  the  three  up-and-at-'em 
Barrymores.  They  are  saying  it  was  all 
started  by  John  just  in  the  spirit  of  good  clean 
fun. 

At  any  rate,  Director  Brabin  was  startled  to 
see  Lionel  raise  his  hand  in  the  midst  of  a  scene 
and  ask  to  be  excused  from  the  set.  A  few 
minutes  later  the  director  was  summoned  to 
the  phone. 

It  was  Lionel,  himself.  "Listen,"  Lionel 
said,  "John  keeps  putting  his  hand  on  my  arm 
in  the  scene  and  it  weakens  my  character.  I 
thought  I'd  tell  you.?? 

T\  TELL,  what  with  Ethel  helping  out  the 
^^  boys,  things  will  be  getting  warmer  and 
warmer  on  that  set.     Or  I'm  a  weather  fore- 
caster. 

A  ND  among  the  stirring  events  to  be 
■*  recorded  is  that  Charles  Brabin  is  off  the 
job  as  director  and  Richard  Boleslavsky  has 
replaced  him. 

TT'S  amusing  to  note  the  arrival  of  the 
Rasputin"  cast  for  work  each  morning. 
The  Czarina,  played  by  Ethel  Barrymore, 
arrives  in  her  limousine.  Rasputin,  the  mad 
monk,  played  by  Lionel,  arrives  next,  also  in  a 
high-powered  car.  The  prince,  John  Barry- 
more,  appears  next  in  a  swanky  roadster.  Then 
the  bit  players  drive  in,  all  with  good  looking 
automobiles. 

And  last  of  all  comes  Ralph  Morgan,  play- 
ing the  mighty  Czar  of  Russia,  in  a  broken 
down  Ford  that  nearly  shakes  the  whiskers 
from  His  Imperial  Majesty's  chin. 


JOHN    BARRYMORE    has    it    all 
doped  out. 
When  they  asked  him,  "Who's  your 
favorite  actor?"  the    answer    is 
"Lionel." 

"And  your  favorite  actress?" 
"Ethel." 

It  saves  so  much  confusion  keep-

While  Lupe  Velez  is  going  to  the  quieter 
places  with  Johnny's  brother. 

When  Marguerite  Churchill  had  her  tonsils 
removed  the  studio  had  to  excuse  George 
O'Brien  from  the  set  every  hour  so  that  he 
could  phone  the  hospital  and  see  how  she  was 
getting  along. 

Incidentally  when  George  is  working  nights 
he  tries  to  select  Marguerite's  escort.  It  is 
always  the  same  man  —  Ricardo  Cortez, 
George's  chum. 

A  ND  now  the  little  French  dancer,  Mile. 
Mistinguette,  is  trying  to  patch  up   the 
quarrel   between   Maurice   Chevalier  and   his

She  Sat  on  the  Floor 


MOST  people  misunder- 
stand Karen  Morley. 
They  believe  her  to  be 
quiet,  without  much 
glamour,  the  owner  of  a  secret  luck 
charm. 

Hollywood  folk  grant  that  she 
did  splendid  acting  in  "Scarface," 
"  Vxsene  Lupin,"  "Are  You  Listen- 
ing?" and  "The  Washington  Mas- 
querade," but  they  will  not  grant 
that  her  luck  charm  was  not  respon- 
sible for  the  opportunities  to  play 
in  such  future-building  productions. 

"Where's  her  pull?"  other  girls 
ask  who  have  been  waiting  for 
months  for  just  such  chances. 

But  Karen  Morley  does  not  wait 
for  pull  or  accidental  opportunities, 
pins  her  faith  to  Karen  Morley. 

Here's  the  first  incident  which  tipped  me  to  the  truth  about 
this  girl. 

Karen  and  George  Hurrell,  the  studio  photographer,  were  not 
chummy.  There  was  no  actual  hostility  between  them.  But 
neither  was  there  the  open  friendliness  which  exists  so  often 
between  an  actress  and  the  man  who  makes  her  publicity 
pictures. 

If  picture  girls  do  not  like  the  photographer,  they  do  not  show 
it.  They  are,  perhaps,  more  effusively  friendly.  Women 
players  cannot  afford — or  so  they  figure — to  offend  the  man 
upon  whom  they  must  depend  to  accentuate  their  points  of 
beauty  and  gloss  their  defects. 

But  not  Karen  Morley! 

If  a  photographer  knows  that  a  player  does  not  like  him, 
what  is  his  natural  reaction?  Does  he  make  bad  pictures  of  her? 
No!    In  the  first  place,  he  can't  afford  it.    Good  pictures  retain 


pro- 


And  right  in  the 
ducer's  office,  too.  It 
wasn't  a  dumbbell  stunt, 
but  clever  salesmanship, 
and  it  won  for  Karen 
Morley  an  important  role

She  creates  them.     She 


him  his  position.  In  the  second,  his 
pride  is  at  stake.  He  will  prove  to 
the  one  who  doesn't  like  him  that 
he's  the  best  photographer  in  the 
business.  He  will  do  well  by  those 
who  gush  over  him,  but  he  will  do 
his  best  for  the  one  who  turns  the 
cold  shoulder.  He'll  show  her! 
It's  human  nature! 

Karen  knew  this.    I  wouldn't  be 
surprised  if  she  exaggerated  her  in- 
difference  to   George   just   to   en- 
courage him  to  stretch  his  natural 
ability  to  its  greatest  height  when 
he   photographed    Karen    Morley. 
He  could  not  make  her  pretty.    But 
he   could    make   her   interestingly 
different. 
He  did.     One  day,  he  took  her  in  a  sexy,  black  negligee. 
Karen  gave  one  look  at  those  pictures,  tucked  them  under  her 
arm  and  rushed  immediately  to  Irving  Thalberg's  office. 

Every  chair  in  that  sanctum  sanctorum  was  occupied.  She 
initiated  a  new  sitting  formula  in  that  dignified  office.  She 
squatted  on  the  floor!  A  well-populated  floor  circle  immedi- 
ately formed  around  her. 

EVENTUALLY,  Mr.  Thalberg  emerged  from  the  inner  office, 
jingling  the  coins  in  his  pants' pocket  as  is  his  executive  custom. 

"Well,  well.  What's  all  this?"  he  demanded,  questioningly 
eyeing  the  daisy  chain. 

Karen  was  on  her  feet  before  the  others  could  collect  breath. 
"  I'd  like  to  see  you,  Mr.  Thalberg,"  she  burst  forth.  Before  he 
knew  what  had  happened,  he  found  himself  back  in  his  own 
office,  the  door  firmly  closed  and  the  eager  girl  facing  him. 

"I  can  play  the  woman  in  'Arsene  Lupin,'  Mr.  Thalberg." 

Straight  to  the  point.  [  please  turn  to  page  125  ] 


"Karen  Morley  isn't  alike  in  any  two  films," 
is  what  everyone  says.  That's  a  compliment. 
She  wisely  believes  that  variety  of  roles  will  keep 
her  on  the  list  of  popular  players  for  a  long  time 


¥> 


Contrast  Karen's  ingenue  appearance  with  Lewis 
Stone  in  "Inspiration,"  with  her  sophisticated 
bearing  opposite  Lionel  Barrymore  in  her  latest, 
"The  Washington  Masquerade."     Smart  girl!

Photoplay  Readers  for  Gags 


Here's  a  swell  gag  from 
Harold  Lloyd's  new 
comedy,  "Movie  Crazy." 
It  runs  like  this.  The 
waiter  on  the  train  yells, 
"Last  call  for  dinner." 
Harold,  seated  in 
lonely  state  on  the  ob- 
servation platform, 
hears  this,  looks  up  ex- 
pectantly and  proceeds 
to  take  a  sandwich  from 
his  pocket.  Carefully  he 
takes  off  the  wrapping 
paper  and  starts  to  eat 
the  sandwich.  Now — 
see  how  easy  writing  a 
gag  is?  This  simple  little 
gag  gets  a  big  laugh  in 
"Movie  Crazy"  which  is, 
incidentally,  a  hilarious 
picture.  You  can  think 
up  a  gag  just  as  funny 
and  maybe  win  one  of 
those  107  cash  prizes 


AMERICA'S  sense  of  humor  is  one  thing  unaffected  by 
the  deprejsion,  judging  by  the  response  to  the  first 
announcement  of  the  Harold  Lloyd  "  Movie-Crazy"

Everybody  has  thought  of  some  hilarious  scene,  stunt  or 
situation  which,  if  enacted  upon  the  screen,  would  throw  movie 
audiences  into  mirthful  chuckles;  and  if  you've  ever  said  to 
yourself,  after  seeing  a  comedy,  "  I  could  think  of  a  gag  as  funny 
as  that" — here's  your  chance. 

These  gag  ideas  can  be  figments  of  your  imagination  or  they 
can  be  actual  happenings.  There  are  no  restrictions  placed  on 
the  type  of  humor  or  situation  submitted  in  this  contest,  except 
that  in  the  final  judging  the  possibilities  of  the  suggestions  from 
the  point  of  view  of  their  application  to  motion  pictures  will  be 
considered  important. 

Harold  Lloyd  is  offering  every  reader  of  Photoplay  an 
opportunity  to  share  in  the  107  prizes  which  he  is  giving  for  this 
contest.  The  awards  are  to  be  divided  as  follows:  First  prize, 
$250;  second  prize,  $100;  third  prize,  $50;  four  prizes  of  $25 
each;  one  hundred  prizes  of  $5  each. 

And  the  grand  part  is  that  it's  so  simple.  A  gag  is  simply  a 
funny  situation.  It  may  involve  one  person  or  a  group  of 
people.  Look  at  the  picture  at  the  top  of  this  page  and  read  its 
caption.    There  is  an  example  of  a  good  gag. 

Try   your   wits    on 


There  is  nothing  complicated  about  entering  this  contest.  All 
you  have  to  do  is  describe  the  scene,  stunt,  joke,  situation — in 
other  words,  the  gag — in  simple,  everyday  words,  and  send  it 
in.  It  can  be  as  brief  as  you  care  to  make  it  and  requires  no 
literary  talent  at  all.  What  Harold  wants  is  gag  ideas  rather 
than  fancy  writing. 

But  before  you  do  this,  be  sure  to  turn  to  page  1 24  of  this 
magazine  and  read  the  rules  of  the  contest  very  carefully.  Don't 
fail  to  do  this,  for  by  neglecting  to  follow  the  rules,  a  very  fine 
gag  of  yours  might  be  disqualified. 

And  remember  that  the  contest  closes  on  November  15, 
which  means  that  your  gag  ideas  must  be  mailed  in  time  to 
reach  the  Movie  Crazy  Contest  Editor,  Photoplay  Magazine, 
221  West  57th  Street,  New  York  City,  by  November  15. 
Gag  ideas  received  after  that  date  cannot  be  considered. 

But  get  your  gag  ideas  in  early.  Send  whatever  you  can 
think  of  at  once.  Then  send  more,  later,  as  they  occur  to  you 
for,  if  you  follow  the  rules,  you  can  send  as  many  gags  as  you 
choose.  Each  and  every  one  will  be  carefully  read  and  con- 
sidered. 

The  judging  committee  is  composed  of  Harold  Lloyd  and 
selected  members  of  Photoplay's  editorial  staff. 

You  know  that  there  are  men  in  Hollywood  who  earn  good 
salaries  by  writing  gags.  They  are  called  "comedy  construc- 
tionists," which  is  pretty  high  flown  language. 

In  reality  they  are  simply  "gag  men,"  but  if  you  put  on  your 
thinking  cap  and  rub  your  funny  bone,  you  can  think  up  as 
good  gags  as  they  can.

The  assured,  sophisticated  man-about-town 
— that's  the  front  William  Powell  presents  to 
the  world  in  pictures  and  gets  away  with — 


THERE  are  many  who  consider  William  Powell  the  most 
complete  sophisticate  in  motion  pictures.  They  claim 
that  he  walks  with  the  most  confident  step,  talks  with 
the  assuredness  of  a  cosmopolite,  regards  other  human 
beings  with  the  sangfroid  of  an  egoist,  and  in  general  conducts 
himself  with  the  perfect  nonchalance  that  typifies  ultra 
sophistication. 

I  have  always  agreed  with  these  many,  but  because  I  know 
Powell  intimately,  there  has  been  a  baffling  other  side  to  him 
that,  until  recently,  I  never  quite  understood.  A  short  time 
ago.  Bill  and  I— over  a  bottle  of  near  beer,  I  think  it  was — 
lifted  the  veils  to  our  inner  souls,  and  on  that  occasion  I  dis- 
covered an  amazingly  different  William  Powell. 

I  hardly  believed  my  own  ears  when  he  admitted  that  his 
worldliness  is  purely  a  business  pose.  One  after  another,  he 
made  six  incredible  admissions: 

He  is  cursed,  as  most  of  its  arc,  with  an  inferiority  complex; 

He  fears  strangers; 

He  is  ill  at  ease  in  the  presence  of  women; 

lie  is  afraid  to  turn  Jus  back  when  he  leaves  a  crowded  room; 

lie  is  a  poor  conversationalist,  and  he  is  not  witty; 

He  is  painfully  aware  that  he  is  not,  in  real  life,  the.  bon  vivant 
he  is  pictured  on  the  screen. 

"Sometimes  I  feel  my  life  is  a  bluff,"  Powell  confessed.  " — a

horrible  bluff,  and  I  am  afraid  to  drop  the  pose. 
If  other  motion  picture  stars  suffer  as  do  I,  it  is  no 
wonder  nervous  breakdowns  are  common  in 
Hollywood. 

"I  can  never  forget  that  I  am  a  motion  picture 
actor,  and  that  I  am  recognized  and  watched  by 
thousands  whom  I  do  not  know.  My  confounded 
inferiority  complex  tells  me  that  they  are  critical; 
that  they  tear  me  to  pieces  in  their  minds;  that 
they  are  disappointed  because  I  do  not,  off  screen, 
measure  up  to  the  William  Powell  who  flits  across 
the  silver  sheet. 

"How  would  you  like  to  live  with  the  feeling 
that  people  are  staring  at  you  and  whispering  among  them- 
selves, 'How  disappointing;  he  is  not  nearly  so  attractive  as  we 
imagined  he  would  be'?  That  ghastly  nightmare  never  leaves 
my  mind.  It  is  because  I  fear  people's  opinions  that  I  rarely 
attend  theater  openings,  premieres,  or  public  functions  of  any 
sort.  Well,  Carole,  too,  thinks  I  am  better  than  I  really  am, 
bless  her  and  keep  her  thinking  so."  (Carole,  of  course,  is 
Carole  Lombard,  his  wife.) 

As  Powell  talked,  it  dawned  on  me  that  I  had  at  last  dis- 
covered that  puzzling  side  of  the  man.  It  is  his  inferiority 
complex.  Several  years  ago  Bill  told  me  when  he  first  learned 
of  this  complex.  It  happened  when  he  was  a  schoolboy.  He 
dreaded  leaving  class  rooms,  eyed  by  other  pupils.  When  it 
became  absolutely  necessary  that  he  leave  class,  he  had  a  man- 
ner of  lifting  his  chin  defiantly  and  marching  from  the  room, 
looking  neither  to  the  right  nor  left. 

POWELL  still  suffers  that  same  schoolboy  mental  reaction. 
When  he  departs  from  a  room  where  other  persons  are 
congregated,  he  involuntarily  elevates  his  chin,  stares  straight 
ahead  and  assumes  an  air  of  extreme  indifference  which  he  does 
not  feel.  I  have  heard  many  people  term  Powell  "high  hat" 
because  of  this  haughty  mannerism.  High  hat?  Bill  Powell! 
If  the  real  truth  were  not  so  tragic,  the  accusation  would  be 
laughable. 

"I  fought  for  years  to  overcome  my  inferiority  complex,"  he 
says.  "Before  I  arrived  in  Hollywood,  I  believed  my  efforts 
had  been  successful,  but  today  my  failing  is  more  acute  than 
ever,  and  I  cannot  fathom  the  reason." 


W 


Hi  there,  Bill,  you 
old  rascal.  So  that 
snootiness  of  yours 
the  ladies  all  fall 
for  is  just  pretense. 
We  think  Jimmy 
Fidler's  close-up  of 
what  you  really  are 
is  a  perfect  shot 


Let  me  tell  you,  Bill.  It  is  because  you  cannot 
do  away  with  that  inferiority  complex.  This  over- 
developed sense  of  modesty  is  born  in  humans — in 
most  humans — and  it  can  no  more  be  lost  than  the 
color  of  eyes  can  be  changed.  You  never  conquered 
your  complex;  you  merely  subdued  it. 

The  reason  you  are  again  slave  to  that  complex 
is  simply  that  you  are  too  conscious  of  the  screen 
William  Powell.  That  fellow  the  public  sees  on  the 
screen  is  a  studied  person.  He  has  to  be;  he  is 
acting.  Does  Tom  Mix  go  around  shooting  Indians 
in  real  life?  Does  Gloria  Swanson  throw  herself  at 
men  in  private  life?  Of  course  not,  because  they 
are  acting  when  they  do  those  things  in  motion 
pictures. 

THAT  screen  fellow  Powell  makes  brilliant 
sallies,  and  he  speaks  them  easily  and  often.  He 
is  perfectly  groomed,  and  as  well  mannered.  There 
is  never  a  hair  out  of  place,  nor  a  collar  wrinkled, 
nor  an  awkward  cuff  shooting  from  a  sleeve.  Has 
it  ever  occurred  to  you  why  the  screen  Powell  is  so  perfect? 
It  is  because  he  is  the  finished  creation  of  dozens  of  other 
people's  plans. 

Scores  of  studio  employees  earn  handsome  salaries  for 
moulding  such  screen  characterizations.  Powell's  brilliant 
remarks  are  the  dialogue  written  by  the  cleverest  writers 
money  can  buy;  writers  who  devote  weeks  to  the  task  of  con- 
cocting smart  phrases  to  be  spoken  by  the  actor. 

If  a  coat  collar  is  drawn  awkwardly  from  the  neck,  there  are 
paid  employees  near  the  camera  whose  job  it  is  to  notice  and 
correct  such  faults.  If  they  fail  to  observe  them,  the  oversight 
is  discovered  when  the  daily  rushes  are  projected,  and  the 
scenes  are  re-photographed.  As  a  consequence  of  these  pre- 
cautions, the  William  Powell  who  reaches  theater  screens  is  the 
personification  of  the  ideas  and  concentrations  of  half  a  hundred 
skilled  studio  technicians. 

But  what  occurs  when  Powell  is  introduced  to  a  group  of 
persons  who  have  seen  him  only  in  motion  pictures?  The 
anticipated  repartee  is  glaringly  absent,  because  Bill  is  no  more 
than  ordinarily  witty  in  conversation.  The  clothes  are  not 
perfectly  groomed,  no  matter  how  careful  he  may  be.  Further- 
more, because  he  suffers  from  his  inferiority  complex,  slight 
faults  assume  gigantic  proportions.  If  a  cuff  extends  too  far 
below  a  coat  sleeve,  Bill  becomes  as  self-conscious  as  though 
he  had  neglected  to  wear  trousers. 

A  short  time  ago  Jack  Warner,  one  of  the  owners  of  the 
producing  company  to  which  Powell  is  under  contract,  re- 
quested Bill  to  act  as  master  of  ceremonies  at  a  premiere. 
Powell  objected  vigorously  on  the  grounds  that  he  could  not 


— But  you  can't  fool  Bill  Powell.  Not  with 
a  whole  row  of  high-hats.  He's  on  to  his  other 
self  and  gives  William  the  loud  horse  laugh 


fulfill  the  duties  of  the  office.  "You  have  seen  me  on  the  screen, 
poised  and  polished  and  full  of  pretty  speeches,"  he  told 
Warner,  "but  that  is  not  the  real  me.  I  am  a  poor  public 
speaker.  I  become  self-conscious  on  the  stage.  1  can  never 
think  of  funny  things  to  say.  I  am  ill  at  ease  before  an  audience." 
Despite  the  protests,  Warner  insisted.  Now  I  happened  to 
attend  the  opening,  primarily  to  see  and  hear  Bill,  and  he  made 
a  favorable  impression.  But  here  is  how  he  describes  the 
occasion: 

I  MADE  a  fearful  mess  of  things.  I  felt  like  an  ass  the  minute 
I  stepped  on  the  stage.  1  attempted  one  bon  mot,  and  when 
nobody  laughed,  I  was  more  self-conscious  than  ever.  When 
it  was  all  over  and  I  had  wrung  the  perspiration  from  my 
handkerchief,  Mr.  Warner  told  me  I  had  done  very  well.  I 
know  better;  I  felt  silly  on  the  stage,  and  I  must  have  looked  it." 
Powell's  inferiority  complex  is  particularly  baneful  in  the 
presence  of  women,  which  I  suspect  is  because  the  female  is 
more  deadly  than  the  male  when  it  comes  to  being  critical. 
He  is  even  abashed  in  the  matter  of  magazine  interviews.  I 
have  known  him  to  plan,  days  previous  to  an  engagement  with 
a  writer,  the  things  he  wants  to  say;  things  that  will  make 
him  appear  as  brilliant  as  the  screen  Powell.  When  the  inter- 
viewers arrive,  his  complex  [  please  turn  to  page  103  ]

Two  scenes  from  the  life  of 
a  clear-eyed,  long-legged  girl 
named  Kay  Francis — in 
which  the  whole  comedy - 
drama  of  a  Hollywood  career 
will  be  found  unfolded 


IT'S  mid-May  of  1929  in  Hollywood,  and  Hall  is  on  the 
prowl. 
I've  seen  that  pioneer  talkie,  "Gentlemen  of  the  Press,'' 
in  which  Walter  Huston  is  featured  as  the  managing  editor 
whose  heart  breaks  while  the  presses  rumble.    But  what  catches 
my  rheumy  eye  is  a  tall,  grave-eyed  and  very  beautiful  girl 
named  Kay  Francis. 

"Here,"  I  mutter  through  my  long,  gray  muff,  "is  a  child 
who  is  going  fast  and  far  in  these  new-fangled  talking  pictures. " 
I  decide,  then  and  there,  that  I  want  my  obituary  to  wind 
up  "in  addition  to  being  a  brilliant  editor,  writer  and  critic,  the 
late  Hall  was  noted  as  the  journalistic  discoverer  of  Kay  Francis, 
screen  star." 

So,  deported  to  Hollywood  by  the  boss,  I  wangle  an  appoint- 
ment with  this  Francis  child,  and  chug  Kayward  through  a 
lovely  Spring  afternoon. 

Over  glasses  of  celery  tonic,  we  talk — this  tall,  clear-eyed 
Francis  girl  and  I. 

She's  just  another  exile  from  the  world  of  the  Xew  York 
stage,  I  find.  She's  lonely,  rattling  around  in  a  rented  house  in 
a  strange  tropical  town  where  bird-songs  batter  her  ear-drums 
and  she  is  smothered  by  the  scent  of  posies. 

She's  working  day  and  night  at  Paramount,  she  tells  me — 
laboring  as  the  menace  in  some  now-forgotten  circus  mon- 
strosity of  a  picture  starring  Clara  Bow.     She  knows  few 
people,  and  sees  them  seldom — Hollywood  is  still  a  mys- 
tery— she  doesn't  know  a  yucca  from  a  mimosa,  and  is 
too  tired  to  care  much. 

"  But  you  do  like  pictures, "  I  say,  after  another  tug  at 
the  tonic. 

"Of  course  I  do,"  she  says,  stabbing  me  to  the  giz- 
zard with  those  magnificent  optics.     "I  want  to  grad- 
uate, eventually,  from  these  siren  things  and  play  so- 
phisticated leads — the  Katherine  Cornell  type  of 
part." 

"Lady,"  I  answer,  "I'll  bet  my  new  red  boots  with 
the  copper-toes  that  whatever  you  want  out  of  this 
racket,  you'll  get." 

And  I  mean  it.  With  that  I  claps  on  my  ten-year 
panama,  shakes  hands  with  the  lady,  and  walks  four 
miles  out  of  my  way,  kerflummuxed  by  Kay  Francis' 
beauty,  keenness  and  charm. 

In  due  course  an  ecstatic  piece  appears  in  these  in- 
spired pages.    It  hails  Kay  as 


The  Kay  Francis  of 
today  —  smooth, 
slim  and  sophisti- 
cated, living  in  the 
madness  of  movie 
fame  and  fortune. 
What  a  different 
girl  she  was  just 
three  years  ago!

pictures,  and  prophesies,  with 
a  dash  of  second-sight,  that

medium. 

And  that's  that.     The

Hedda  Hopper  knows  am- 
bassadors, prop  boys,  club- 
women and  Garbo.  This 
story  reveals  what  happen- 
ed when  the  silent  Swedish 
girl  met  the  sociable  Hedda 


SHE'S  Hollywood's  most  amazing  lady. 
Every  city,  town  or  village  has  one,  of  course.     And 
Hedda  Hopper  is  Hollywood's.    And  Hollywood,  we  may 
add,  is  Hedda  Hopper's. 
She's  the  "inside  track"  lady  of  the  village.     Inside  here. 
Inside  there.    Inside  everywhere. 

She  knows  exactly  why  so  and  so  did  such  and  such.  And 
where.  And  when.  And  whether  it  was  rainy  that  night  or 
just  foggy.  Without  ever  asking.  Or  particularly  wanting  to 
know. 

For  people  walk  up  to  Hedda's  front  door,  ring  the  bell, 
walk  in  and  tell  her.  That's  all.  They  go  out  of  their  palm 
tree  way  to  find  Hedda's  ear.  While  fan  writers,  motion  pic- 
ture executives  and  publicity  departments  bite  their  nails  in 
suspense  and  walk  up  and  down  the  near  Oriental  rugs  wringing 
their  hands  in  despair. 

But  Hedda — huh,  she  knows.  And  hands  out  advice  like  an 
old  time  judge. 

AND  all  the  time  she  looks  like  a  million  and  a  half  dollars. 
On  the  gold  standard,  of  course. 

Hollywood  builds  twenty-two  room  mansions  with  swimming 
pools  and  solid  mahogany  bars.  Littered  with  butlers,  valets, 
maids  and  husbands.  And  with  simply  elegant  parties  coaxes, 
begs,  invites,  cajoles  in  the  upper-crusters. 

Hedda  Hopper  lives  in  the  smallest  bungalow  in  Hollywood, 
has  a  plain  taupe  carpet  on  the  floor  and  one  Swedish  maid  to 
her  name.  Yet  people  who  form  a  line  to  the  right  to  get  into 
Hedda's,  would  bowl  over  Mrs.  Astorbilt  herself. 

Santa  Barbara,  and  you  know  your  Santa  Barbara  if  you 
know  your  "Town  and  Country, "  dotes  on  Hedda.  The  swank 
of  the  town  crowd  the  roads  to  Hedda's  cottage  door. 

Pasadena,  and  you  know  your  Pasadena  if  you  know  your 
slightly  frayed  millionaires,  burns  up  the  twenty  miles  between 
palatial  hotels  to  Hedda's  cabin  in  the  cotton. 

Beverly  Hills  society,  who  generally  pass  out  a  couple  of 
polite,  but  thoroughly  chilled  raspberries  to  aspiring  movie  folk, 
stampede  daily  over  to  Hedda's.  And  Hedda's  movie  friends, 
big  ones  and  small  ones,  are  there  as  well. 

Inside,  amidst  the  crowd  and  hubbub,  is  Hedda  herself. 
Passing  out  the  refreshments  herself.  No  frozen-faced  house 
boy  who  looks  like  a  sure  threat  of  murder  is  there  to  chill  the 
proceedings.  Beverage  shaker  in  one  hand  and  sandwich  tray 
in  the  other,  Hedda  goes  about  serving  her  friends.  Telling 
those  priceless  stories  that  only  Hedda  can  tell.  Everyone  made 
to  feel  that  comfy,  wanted  feeling.  And  they  love  it.  And 
simply  won't  go  home. 

That  Hopper  woman.    Tsk,  tsk,  tsk. 

She'll  attend,  by  invitation,  of  course,  the  graduation  exer- 
cises in  the  garden  of  an  exclusive  finishing  school  in  the  after- 
noon and  be  chief  bottle  washer  at  a  weiner  roast  that  night. 

At  the  studio  she  knows  every  prop  boy,  carpenter,  cutter, 
stenographer,  director  and  executive  by  his  first  name. 


Hedda  lives  in  one  of  the  smallest  bungalows  in 
Hollywood,  but  the  great  and  near-great  try  to 
wangle  invitations  to  her  social  affairs.  She  has 
more  real  friends  than  any  woman  in  town.  But 
it  has  cost  her  her  career,  and  she  knows  it 


It's  "Hello  Joe"  to  the  prop  boy  and  "Hello  Bill"  to  the 
executive. 

And  she'll  say  exactly  what  she  thinks  on  every  subject. 
She  knows  to  whom  she  must  make  a  certain  remark  in  order 
to  have  it  carried  back  to  that  person.  A  person  who  needs 
just  such  a  remark  to  pull  him  up. 

She  talks  incessantly,  but  has  a  reason  behind  every  remark 
and  action.    She's  far-seeing  and    [  please  turn'  to  pack  108  ]

SH-H-H.  Come  inside  and  close  the  door  so  Sylvia  won't 
hear.  Bring  a  ten  pound  box  of  chocolates  for  you'll  be 
hungry,  and  listen  carefully  while  your  Aunt  Lois  lets 
you  in  on  a  few  inside  secrets  of  the  food  habits  of  these 
movie  stars. 

Now  who  do  you  suppose  has  the  biggest  appetite  in  Holly- 
wood? Wally  Beery?  Don't  make  me  laugh.  It's  a  gorgeous 
blonde  siren  who — .  But  wait.  What  is  in  that  same  mysterious 
package  that  reposes  every  day  on  the  napkin  covered  tray 
that  travels  to  Garbo's  dressing-room?  Who  eats  cheese  and 
crackers  for  breakfast  and  what  riot-with-the-ladies  carries 
pockets  full  of  peanuts  everywhere  he  goes? 

Ah  ha,  I  thought  you'd  sit  up  pretty. 

Well,  when  Constance  Bennett  entertains  luncheon  guests, 
what  I  mean  is,  the  guests  are  entertained.  Plump-conscious 
blondes  sit  in  wide-eyed  amazement  as  Connie  reaches  for  a 
second  helping  of  those  lovely  hot  biscuits,  a  third  generous 
serving  of  mashed  potatoes  (with  butter)  another  slice  of  beef, 
and  dear  me,  dear  me,  what  elegant  whipped  cream. 
A  little  more  of  the  cream,  please. 

P'or  Constance  Bennett  eats  more  food  than  any 
star  in  town.  While  most  people  are  contented  (or 
have  to  be)  with  one  small  serving,  Connie  reaches 
for  two  or  three  helpings.  And  what?  Nothing. 
She  never  gains  an  ounce.  Connie,  healthy,  hungry 
and  eager  to  gain,  eats  three  square  (and  such  large 
squares)  meals  a  day  and  remains  the  same  Connie.

"Why  no,"  Bob  answered. 

"Oh,  excuse  me,"  the  embarrassed  man 
replied,  "but  I  see  two  sandwiches,  two  pie 
orders  and  two  glasses  of  milk.  I-er-that 
is — nice  day  isn't  it?" 

"Double  order  Bob."  His  name  in  the 
commissary.  Not  a  heavy  or  elaborate  lunch 
for  Bob,  but  always  two  of  everything. 

Rare  roast  beef.  The  kind  that  merely 
rises  up  and  bows  to  the  oven  enroute  to  the 
table.  Heavy,  hearty  vegetables.  Cabbage. 
Beans.  No  dessert.  No  funnv  fixings. 
That's  Wally  Beery. 

"Naw  I  don'  want 
that  sissy  looking  cake. 
Take  it  away.  I  was 
raised  on  plain  food 
and  I  ain't  done  so 
bad,  eh?" 


Someone  concocted  a  Wally  Beery  sandwich  at  the  M-G-M 
commissary  which  consisted  of  dainty  squares  of  toast  upon 
which  reposed  dainty  peanut  butter,  a  small  slice  of  chicken 
and  a  dash  of  tomato.  Wally  took  one  look.  Just  one  look. 
Now  run  on  home  and  don't  ask  what  Wally  said. 

ON  gala  days  Joan  Crawford  orders  two  slices  of  raisin  bread. 
And  then  very  daintily,  Joan  plucks  the  plump  raisins 
from  their  whole  wheat  beds  and  eats  only  the  raisins,  one  at  a 
time.  Such  gorging.  Once  in  a  while,  Joan  will  order  a  "Joan 
Crawford"  salad  which  consists  of  large  mounds  of  cottage 
cheese  literally  surrounded  by  white  cooked  figs,  over  this  goes 
a  non-fattening  dressing.  But  oftener  Joan  will  have  a 
shredded  wheat  biscuit  with  skimmed  milk.  But  during  heavy 
love  scenes  Joan  takes  nothing  but  (here,  weep  in  my  handker- 
chief) two  glasses  of  sauerkraut  juice  a  day.  Sweet  romance! 
The  M-G-M  lunch-room  is  a  big  place  with  linoleum  on  the 
floor — nothing  fancy,  mind  you — and,  like  all  Gaul  and  studio 
commissaries,  divided  into  three  parts — 
the  main  dining  room,  the  lunch  counter 
and  the  glassed-in  porch  outside.

talk  things  over. 

All  sorts  of  people  are  gathered  together 
in  the  studio  commissaries.  A  man  in  full 
evening  dress  chats  with  a  football  player. 
They're  both  extras.  And  the  little  girl 
in  big  hoop  earrings  and  a  colorful  shawl 
was  born  in  St.  Louis  and  never  saw  Spain. 
An  everyday  studio  commissary  sight  is 
that  of  two  actors — one  reading  the  script 
and  the  other  reciting. 
Nobody  pays  any  attention  to  them. 

Loretta  Young  has  a  flaming  passion  for  tamales.  And  will 
send  to  Hollywood  restaurants,  from  her  studios  at  Burbank, 
for  tamales  for  luncheon.  Now,  the  minute  a  restaurant  keeper 
in  town  spies  a  First  National  car  passing  down  the  boulevard, 
he  begins  wrapping  up  Loretta's  tamales. 

They  have  given  up  at  the  studio.  They  have  given  up  at 
home.  The  impossible  in  Hollywood  has  happened.  No  one 
has  ever  yet  been  able  to  fill  up  Jackie  Cooper.  There  seems 
to  be,  according  to  scientific  research,  workers,  a  complete  and 
mysterious  vacuum  within  the  diminutive  Jackie.  Eat? 
Heaven  help  us.  Connie  Bennett  only  can  hold  a  candle  to 
Jackie.

LOVE  ME  TONIGHT— Paramount 


WHAT  a  picture!  First,  you  have  Chevalier  (and  last, 
you  have  Chevalier,  and  all  through  this  riot  of  enter- 
tainment you  have  Chevalier) — zat  Maurice  who  captures  you 
with  his  risque  songs,  his  magnetic  smile  and  his  rakish 
straw  hat.  And,  adding  her  beauty  and  lovely  voice,  you 
have  that  delightful  Jeanette  MacDonald.  And  those  two 
ridiculous  Charlies — Ruggles  and  Butterworth.  And  C. 
Aubrey  Smith,  who  plays  a  doughty  old  duke  and  puts  over 
a  solo  as  inimitably  as  Maurice.  Then  there  is  Myrna  Loy. 
And  others  equally  good.  The  story?  About  a  lowly  tailor 
who  woos  a  princess.  The  music?  Woven  through  the 
whole  picture  like  a  brilliant  symphony,  accented  with  some 
of  the  catchiest  tunes  of  the  season.  You'll  surely  be  hum-

HORSE  FEATHERS— Paramount 


IT'S  full  of  Marx  Brothers.  The  four,  mad,  hysterical 
Marxes.  It  has  horse  feathers  and  horse  laughs.  Non- 
sense and  no  sense.  If  you  want  to  forget  your  troubles  and 
you  yearn  for  a  long  laugh,  a  howl  and  a  yelp,  see  Groucho  as 
maniacal  professor,  Harpo  as  a  dog-catcher  and  Chico  as  a 
combination  bootlegger  and  ice  man. 

Through  nine  long  reels  and  Thelma  Todd's  bedroom  they 
race  and  tear,  dripping  wisecracks  as  they  go. 

Zeppo,  the  youngest,  is  Groucho's  son,  in  love  with  the 
college  widow.  Groucho  sets  out  in  overshoes  and  carrying 
an  umbrella  to  break  up  the  romance,  only  to  succumb  him- 
self. The  football  game  is  a  scream.  You  won't  know  at  all 
what  it's  all  about.  But  then  neither  do  the  Marx  Brothers. 
Who  cares?    It's  that  funnv.

ONCE  IN  A  LIFETIME— Universal 


EVERYONE  wondered  whether  or  not  a  studio  would 
dare  to  make  the  film  version  of  this  famous  stage  play 
which  poked  the  finger  of  fun  at  Hollywood,  but  Hollywood 
burlesques  itself  in  such  a  hilarious  and  screamingly  funny 
manner  that  you'll  never  forgive  yourself  if  you  miss  it. 

The  satire  is  all  there;  not  a  bit  of  the  kidding  has  been 
left  out. 

Hats  off  to  Universal  for  bringing  it  to  the  screen  intact. 
In  fact,  because  of  the  versatility  of  the  camera,  the  picture 
is  one  up  on  the  play  and  the  book. 

Prepare  to  laugh  yourself  out  of  your  chair.  You  may  not 
live  in  mad  Hollywood,  but  you  must  know  enough  about 
its  madness  to  appreciate  an  expose  of  it. 

Jack  Oakie,  as  the  dumb  and  therefore  successful  Dr. 
Lewis  (producer),  is  a  howl  from  start  to  finish. 

Gregory  Ratoff  is  perfect  as  the  typical  motion  picture 
mogul  of  moguls. 

Aline  MacMahon  brings  her  stage  role  to  the  screen  and 
we're  betting  Hollywood  won't  ever  let  her  go  back  on  the 
stage. 

Sidney  Fox  plays  the  dumb  Dora  adorably. 

To  pick  out  even  a  few  "best  performances"  is  impossible, 
because  the  whole  cast  is  so  excellent. 


■A: 


OKAY  AMERICA!— Universal 


HERE'S  the  picture  Walter  Winchell  refused  to  make. 
And  what  a  chance  Mrs.  Winchell's  little  boy  missed. 
For  the  famous  columnist  is  glorified  and  heroized.  He's  a 
snooping,  nosey  little  scandal-disher  with  so  much  charm 
and  nerve  that  you  like  him.  Lew  Ayres  plays  the  chatter 
writer  who  goes  newsgathering  in  every  night  club  and 
speakeasy.  And  heaven  help  the  cheaters.  He  accidentally 
barges  in  (where  angels  fear  to  tiptoe)  at  a  kidnapping, 
agrees  to  act  as  a  go-between,  is  double-crossed  and  finally 
is  sent  by  the  leader  to  barter  with  the  President. 

Boy,  they've  written  a  living,  breathing  column.  It 
carries  one  along  right  to  the  big,  dramatic  ending. 

Lew  comes  back  in  this  one  and  Maureen  O'Sullivan  is 
great.    It  has  suspense,  thrills  and  good  old  hokum.

ONE  WAY  PASSAGE— Warners 


BY  far  the  best  movie  that  Kay  Francis  and  William 
Powell  have  turned  out  as  a  team.  Believe  it  or  not,  it's 
a  romantic  ghost  story — and  it's  swell  stuff. 

Most  of  the  action  takes  place  on  a  boat  going  from 
Hongkong  to  San  Francisco  with  a  stopover  at  Honolulu. 

Aline  MacMahon,  as  Barrelhouse  Betty  gone  ritzy,  and 
Frank  McHugh,  as  the  incorrigible  petty  thief  with  a  silly 
but  infectious  laugh,  give  the  picture  some  hilarious 
moments.  And  you'll  get  a  kick  out  of  Betty's  bangs.  About 
those  ghosts?  You'll  have  to  see  the  finish  of  the  picture  to 
find  out  about  them.  But  the  gentle  romance — love  at  first 
sight — is  what  you  will  remember. 

Powell  and  Francis  have  never  been  more  charming  and 
sincere  than  as  the  lovers  in  "One  Way  Passage."

BIRD  OF 

PARADISE- 

RKO-Radio 


IT  has  everything  a  moving  picture  ought  to  have — exciting 
action,  comedy,  beauty  and  love  interest.  Edward  Robinson 
is  grand  as  the  bragging  Portuguee  Mike  and  Zita  Johann  is  a 
new  shady  dame,  while  Richard  Ariel]  is  perfectly  cast  as  the 
sturdy  young  fisherman  who  loves  his  pal's  wife.  Salty  and 
vivid,  this  adventure  picture  is  exciting  entertainment.  You 
won't  even  mind  the  draggy  ending. 


LAVISH  settings,  gorgeous  photography  and  the  spirited 
musical  score,  plus  good  acting  by  Dolores  Del  Rio  and  Joel 
McCrea,  give  this  a  good  rating.  Young  moderns  will  thrill  to 
the  love  scenes,  as  romantic  and  daring  as  any  recent  film  has 
offered,  but  the  story  about  a  native  princess  and  a  white  boy 
will  seem  out  of  date.  The  film  actually  cost  its  producers  a 
million  dollars.

HERE'S  another  "new  idea"  picture.  It's  originality  with 
capital  letters.  Joel  McCrea  almost  out-Weissmullers 
Johnny  Weissmuller,  while  Leslie  Banks  is  a  refined  and  there- 
fore twice-as-fascinating  edition  of  Frankenstein.  Acting 
honors  go  to  Banks,  who  plays  a  Russian  who  has  become  so 
bored  with  life  that  hunting  down  men  is  the  only  thrill  left  for 
him.    Don't  pass  this  one  by. 


JACKIE  COOPER'S  best  since  'The  Champ."  This  time  he 
J  has  a  real  story.  What  happens  to  children  after  their 
parents  divorce  and  marry  again?  It's  a  tough  road  beset  with 
both  tears  and  laughter.  Lois  Wilson,  Lewis  Stone  and  Conrad 
Nagel  are  the  grown-ups.  Jackie  does  some  of  his  best  work, 
with  his  amazing  naturalness.  Very  much  worth  seeing,  but 
more  for  grown-ups  than  children.

DEVIL  AND

Paramount 


CROONERS  are  would-be  singers  that  girls  go  for  in  a  big 
way  and  men  would  like  to  choke,  according  to  this  picture. 
It  hands  a  loud  but  quite  amusing  razz  to  all  such  radio  per- 
formers. It  took  courage  for  good  looking  David  Manners  to 
play  a  college  lad  who  becomes  one  of  these  ridiculed  crooners. 
Ken  Murray  and  Ann  Dvorak  help  to  make  this  bright  and  en- 
tertaining.

THIS  Charles  Laughton — what  an  actor!  He  will  give  you  a 
new  thrill  as  you  watch  him  almost  steal  the  picture  from 
Tallulah  Bankhead  and  Gary  Cooper.  You'll  forgive  him  for 
doing  it,  too,  because  his  portrayal  of  a  jealous,  crazed  sub- 
marine commander  who  carries  his  wife  and  her  lover  to  the 
bottom  of  the  sea  for  revenge,  is  magnificent.  The  undersea 
shots  are  breathtaking.

WAR  CORRE-

Columbia 


THE 

CRASH— 
First  National 


YOU'LL  be  vastly  arausej  by  Ralph  Graves'  trench-side 
broadcast  of  activities  on  the  Chinese  battle  front.  He's  a 
tinhorn  hero,  turned  war  correspondent,  and  there  is  plenty  of 
punch  and  also  hokum  in  this  story  of  his  feud  with  Jack  Holt, 
another  American  who  is  mixed  up  in  the  foreign  fracas.  Lila 
Lee,  pleasingly  continuing  her  picture  comeback,  is  the  other 
side  of  the  triangle. 


THIS  is  a  thoroughly  unbelievable  story.  How  come,  Ruth 
Chatterton,  since  your  contract  says  you  may  select  your 
own?  It's  all  about  the  depression  and  really  is  too  stupid  to 
synopsize.  Ruth  looks  lovely  and  her  clothes  are  gorgeous. 
George  Brent,  her  recent  husband,  does  the  best  he  can  with 
such  bad  material.  And  these  two  are  usually  so  charming  on 
the  screen.    Too  bad! 


GUILTY 
AS  HELL— 
Paramount 


THE  LAST 
MILE— 
World  Wide 


MYSTERY  with  a  chuckle.  Murder  with  a  wisecrack.  And 
there  are  Edmund  Lowe  and  Vic  McLaglen  the  same  old 
friendly  enemies.  A  snappy  little  crime  mix-up  with  Richard 
Arlen  almost  getting  the  rap  for  a  crime  he  didn't  commit.  But 
leave  it  to  the  "  Sez  You"  twins  to  find  it  out  in  time.  Adrienne 
Ames  is  grand  as  the  girl  and  Henry  Stephenson  is  one  swell 
villain.    It's  new,  sparkling  and  entertaining. 


IF  you  like  intense  drama  with  a  morbid  note,  you'll  like  this 
story,  the  action  of  which  takes  place  almost  entirely  in  the 
death  house  of  a  penitentiary.  Seeing  how  men  in  all  walks  of 
life  face  the  electric  chair  is  both  blood-curdling  and  illuminat- 
ing. A  doomed  man's  mother  is  the  only  woman  in  the  picture. 
Georgie  Stone's  performance  should  place  him  among  the  head- 
liners.    Powerful  if  shuddery. 


THE  NIGHT

BLONDIE 
OF  THE 
FOLLIES— 
M-G-M 


IF  you  like  mysteries,  you  should  see  this  picture,  for  it  has 
an  abundance  of  thrills  that  will  make  your  flesh  creep.  It's 
a  big  break  for  Adolphe  Menjou  and  he  certainly  makes  the 
most  of  the  opportunity.  In  this  you'll  get  the  first  glimpse  of 
Mayo  Methot,  a  clever  girl  from  the  stage,  while  old  faithful 
Skeets  Gallagher  again  turns  in  plenty  of  laughs.  Save  an 
evening  for  this. 


A  SPRIGHTLY,  well-framed  story  with  brilliant  backstage 
atmosphere,  thrills,  suspense  and  some  very  tender 
moments.  Marion  Davies  is  charming  as  the  little  Eastside 
girl  who  makes  a  success  in  the  Follies,  and  Billie  Dove  has 
never  been  more  lovely.  The  high  point  comes  when  Marion 
and  Jimmy  Durante  do  a  burlesque  of  "Grand  Hotel."  Bob 
Montgomery  plays  the  lead,  [additional  reviews  on  page  97]

Marie  Dressier s 


MY  philosophy — the  grand  lesson 
life  has  taught  me — this  is  the 
real  story  of  my  life. 
What  happens  to  you,  day 
by  day,  doesn't  matter  much.  It  is 
what  you  think  about  what  happens  to 
you  that  is  important. 

The  whole  course  of  your  life  may  be 
changed  by  an  open  window,  or,  getting 
the  wrong  number  on  a  telephone,  or  a 
traffic  blockade.  But  your  mind  and 
your  heart  will  keep  steadily  toward  their 
goal. 

Neither  people  nor  events  nor  places 
make  any  real  difference — only  how  much 
we  love  them,  what  we  think  about  them, 
what  we  see  in  them.  That  is  the  sum 
of  you  and  your  history. 

I  have  seen  the  face  of  existence  change 
beyond  recognition.  Mechanical  devices 
have  altered  the  ways  and  means  of  toil 
and  pleasure.  We  have  worked  out  of 
the  narrowness  and  suppression  of  my 
early  days,  and  sometimes  I  think  we 
have  worked  into  license  and  danger. 
We  have  more  sanitation  and  plumbing 
— but  we  have  less  homes  and  fewer  fire- 
places. We  have  more  airplanes  and 
fewer  horses.  We  get  places  faster,  but 
I  am  not  sure  that  we  see  any  more. 

I  know  now  that  external  things  do  not 
mean  much  and  that  human  relationships 
are  all  that  count.  The  road  may  look 
different,  but  it  is  the  same  road  of  life, 
the  obstacles  may  have  different  names, 
but  they  are  the  same  obstacles — and 
the  goal  is  the  same — happiness. 

Depression?  I  have  lived  a  lifetime  of 
depression,  skating  on  thin  ice  among  the 
rich  and  the  poor.  Nobody  ever  knew. 
Why  should  they?  It  was  my  business. 
What  did  it  matter?  If  I  could  not 
possess  things,  I  could  own  them  with 
my  mind  and  my  heart  and  my  imagina- 
tion. 

Failure?  Who  cares?  We  are  as 
great  as  the  things  we  understand  and 
love  and  appreciate.  When  you  listen 
to  a  song  with  love,  you  are  as  great  as 
the  man  who  wrote  it.  When  you  enter 
into  sympathy  with  a  great  poet,  the 
real  glory  of  his  achievement  is  yours,  too. 

YOU  live  in  your  own  world — a  world 
you  create  for  yourself.  Yesterday  is 
gone  from  that  world,  and  tomorrow 
never  comes.  And  today  is  yours,  to 
think  of  as  you  will,  to  fill  as  you  wish. 

Three  things  are  necessary  to  life. 
Laughter  and  music  and  religion.  You 
may  choose  your  own  religion — but  you 
must  worship  and  believe  in  something. 

And  there  is  one  prayer  for  all  races, 
colors,  creeds — Teach   Me  To  Love. 

If  you  pray  that  every  day,  you  will 
not  need  anything  else.  And  you  will 
never  need  to  fear  the  white  wings  of 
death. 

When  I  was  young  I  prayed  for  many 
things.     For  success — and  wealth  to  buy 

56 


"Three  things  are  neces- 
sary to  life  —  laughter, 
music,  religion.  You  must 
believe    in    something" 


"The  only  worthwhile 
love  is  the  love  that  ex- 
pects nothing  and  that 
externals  cannot  alter" 


"I  look  back  over  my  life 

and  realize  there  is 

nothing,  absolutely 

nothing,  ever  to  fear" 


many  things.  For  happiness — and  some- 
one to  share  it.  For  a  place  in  the  sun — 
and  the  world  to  watch  me. 

Now  I  make  but  one  prayer — and  I 
may  make  it  anywhere.  No  need  for 
church  walls  nor  any  altar.  Anywhere, 
in  the  sun  or  the  rain,  in  the  darkness 
or  the  light,  alone  or  amid  a  crowd,  on 
the  set  or  in  my  own  garden,  my  soul 
may  kneel  and  say,  "Teach  me  to  love." 

• 

TO  love  wisely,  patiently,  with  gen- 
erosity, with  courtesy,  with  humility, 
with  kindness. 

You  need  nothing  more  for  religion. 
You  can  be  truly  happy  with  nothing 
less.  And  there  is  always  something  and 
someone  to  love.  It  may  be  only  a 
mongrel  pup,  like  the  one  who  cavorts 
in  my  back  yard  right  now.  It  may  be 
someone  great,  for  the  great  are  often 
lonely.  It  may  be  a  sinner,  who  needs  it 
most.   And  as  long  as  you  love,  you  live. 

When  you  reach  the  rich  glory  of  later 
years,  you  look  back  over  the  agony  and 
the  joy  of  living,  and  you  know  many- 
things. 

I  wouldn't  give  up  my  hard  knocks, 
my  suffering,  my  hurts,  for  anything 
in  the  world.  That  is  what  makes  my 
life  so  rich  now.  That  is  what  makes 
the  latter  half  of  life  worth  living.  Be- 
cause from  every  one  of  them  grows  some 
new  strength,  some  new  knowledge,  some 
new  tenderness. 

What  is  our  greatest  mistake? 

Expecting  too  much  of  life.  Too 
much  ease,  too  much  pleasure.  Expect- 
ing too  much  of  people — of  friends — of 
marriage — of  children. 

The  only  worthwhile  friends  are  the 
ones  you  can  drop  and  pick  up — and 
find  them  just  the  same.  The  only 
worthwhile  love  is  the  love  that  expects 
nothing,  and  that  externals  cannot  alter. 

I  WOULDN'T  give  you  two  cents  for 
the  person  who  never  changes,  who 
has  never  slipped,  never  failed  me.  They 
aren't  human.  We  all  change.  I  look  back 
upon  the  child  I  was,  dreaming,  yearn- 
ing, hungry  for  life.  Upon  the  young 
woman  I  was,  unhappy  because  life  had 
forced  me  into  the  theater  when  I  thought 
I  should  be  married  and  have  a  dozen 
children. 

Upon  the  gray  days  of  my  first  middle 
age,  when  it  seemed  that  life  was 
finished  for  me — had  passed  me  by.  And  I 
realize  how  little  we  know,  how  little  we 
can  see  ahead.  I  realize  how  I  have  been 
many  women  in  my  life,  changing  from 
year  to  year,  sometimes  from  day  to  day. 
And  it  has  all  been  good  and  I  know  that 
from  darkness  has  come  light  and  from 
discouragement  has  come  beauty. 

Years  ago  I  sat  one  day  in  the  old 
Polo  Grounds.  Some  great  batter  was 
standing  at  the  plate.  The  man  who 
was   my   escort   explained   that   he   was 


Own  Story 


Marie  Dressier,  "Grand 
Old  Girl"  of  pictures, 
opens  her  wise  and  lov- 
ing heart  to  Photoplay's 
family  of  readers  in 
this  revealing  article 


very  great,  that  he  hit  more  often  than  anyone  else  in  the 
league.  His  batting  average  was  .420.  He  was  the  very  best 
— and  his  average  was  .420  out  of  a  possible  thousand. 

That  is  a  pretty  good  average.  Love  people  in  spite  of  the 
fact  that  they  bat  only  .420.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  they  fail 
almost  as  often  as  you  fail  yourself.  Love  your  friends  when 
they  need  you,  and  your  lover  when  he  has  nothing  but  your 
love. 

I  am  not  afraid  any  more  to  be  called  changeable.  I  am  not 
worried  any  more  because  I  cannot  take  sides  positively  about 
this  or  that.  I  do  not  mind  if  my  friends  say  I  shilly-shally. 
It  means  that  I  can  see  all  sides  of  life,  that  I  have  at  least 
grown  into  a  wider  vision  and  a  more  tender  desire  to  under- 
stand. 

When  I  was  a  young  woman  and  had  made  a  sensational 
success  at  the  Casino  in  New  York,  I  lived  with  a  woman 
friend  at  an  apartment  just  in  back  of  the  theater.  Nights 
when  we  had  not  been  invited  out  for  supper,  we  used  to  hurry 
home  and  sit  in  the  window  and  watch  the  crowds  leave  the 
theater,  and  looking  down  upon  them  I  would  be  thrilled  to 
remember  how  they  had  applauded  me,  how  they  had  called 
me  back  time  after  time. 

ONE  night,  my  friend  said  to  me,  "Marie,  you  are  very 
lucky." 

I  was  angry  with  her  for  a  moment.  Lucky?  No — it  wasn't 
luck.    I  had  scored  that  success  because  I  was  good. 

Then,  when  I  seemed  to  be  a  total  failure,  when  I  couldn't 
find  a  job,  when  my  money  was  very  low,  indeed,  I  found  myself 
one  day  thinking,  "Marie,  you're  unlucky." 

When  we  are  successful,  we  do  not  believe  much  in  luck. 
But  when  we  are  unfortunate,  we  do. 

I  believe  in  luck.  I  know  I  have  been  lucky  and  I  never 
cease  to  be  grateful. 

But  I  must  explain  what  I  mean  by  luck. 

Luck  is  what  we  are  given.  Luck  is  what  comes  to  us  from 
some  power  outside  ourselves. 

To  get  it,  we  must  keep  open  the  windows  of  our  souls.  We 
must  ask  for  the  gift.    We  must  call  for  luck. 

We  are  always  answered. 

We  use  such  a  very  little  of  the  great  thing  we  possess — 
the  great  power  which  is  ours. 

The  day  came  when  I  had  my  great  chance  in  pictures,  at  a 
time  when  it  seemed  to  me  I  was  through.  And  a  young 
friend  of  mine,  gay  and  a  little  hard  in  his  success  said,  "Marie, 
you  can't  do  it.  You  are  foolish  to  try  Marthy  in  'Anna 
Christie.'    The  public  will  not  accept  you." 

My  courage  faltered.  I  have  always  been  conscious  of  my 
own  limitations.  I  have  always  been  dissatisfied,  as  everyone 
is  who  has  a  high  ideal  for  his  work.  But  I  have  learned  at 
last  not  to  be  bothered  about  it.  Our  best  is  our  best — and 
often,  thank  the  dear  God  who  watches  over  us  so  lovingly, 
it  is  good  enough. 

So  when  I  came  to  do  Marthy;!  knew  that  I  could  not  do  it 
alone.     From  within  my  own  hidden  stores,  or  from  without, 


As  Told  By 

Adela  Rogers 
St.  Johns 


Marie  at  the  Mayfair,  swankiest  of  all  Hollywood 
formal  functions.  Colorful  and  crowded  as  it  is 
with  the  youth,  the  beauty,  the  talent  of  filmland, 
she  steals  the  scene  from  all  of  them.  Not  be- 
cause she  wants  to,  but  because  great  personalities 
like  Marie  can't  help  it — on  the  screen  or  in  life 


must  come  something  better  than  just  Marie  Dressier.  I 
do  not  know  how  that  strength  came.  Whether  in  answer 
to  my  call,  through  the  open  windows  of  my  soul,  or  from  the 
depths  of  the  spiritual  reservoir  every  man  and  woman  carries 
within,  but  it  came — as  it  comes  to  everyone. 

When  I  was  quite  a  young  woman,  a  great  man,  a  great 
American,  told  me  about  that  reservoir.  That  golden  store- 
house within  which  absorbs  the  overflow  of  our  everyday 
thinking  and  praying  and  remembering,  where  we  keep  stored 
for  all  time  the  good  and  beauty  and  knowledge  that  have 
passed  through  our  lives.  Open  [  please  turn  to  page  102  ]

A  Very 

"Unreliable

WATCH  out  for  him,"  Hollywood  whispers.  "He'll 
arrive  one  hour  late.  Or  not  at  all.  He'll  let  you 
down  and  cost  you  plenty.  Unreliable." 
And  so  the  whispering  campaign  against  Lee 
Tracy  goes  on.  At  parties,  at  the  Brown  Derby  or  the  Cocoa- 
nut  Grove.    Buzz,  buzz,  buzz. 

Stories  grow  and  multiply.  By  the  time  the  evening  is 
over,  Lee  has  not  only  burned  down  the  studio  but  choked 
each  and  every  Warner  brother  into  complete  insensibility. 
It's  quite  dreadful. 

And  this  impossible,  tyrannical,  despotic  Tracy  guy;  this 
Lee;  where  is  he  hiding  out  while  Hollywood  whispers  and 
warns? 

Well,  children,  this 
dreadful  bogey  man  is 
either  one  of  two  places. 
He's  either  on  a  rickety, 
wave-tossed  boat  deep- 
sea  fishing  on  the  Pacific 
or  he's  in  some  Holly- 
wood studio  making  a 
picture  that  will  knock 
the  fans  edgewise.  And 
is  no  more  bothered  with 
Hollywood's  back-fence 
gossip  than  Garbo  is  with 
quilting  bees. 

He's  even  amused  by 
it.  And  thinks  it's  fun- 
ny. "Listen,"  he'll  say, 
"did  you  hear  the  latest 
about  me?  What?  You 
didn't  hear  that  I  phoned 
such  and  such  an  execu- 
tive and  asked  him  kind- 
ly to  go  to  a  decidedly 
hot  place  with  my  com- 
pliments? And  then 
walked  off  the  set  in  the 
middle  of  the  picture? 
Well, well,"  he'll  say, "you 
haven't   heard   a   thing. 

"But,  of  course,"  he'll 
go  on,  "you  heard  how  I 
made    'Blessed    Event'? 


Half  of  Lee's  acting  is  in 
the  way  he  uses  his  sensi- 
tive hands.  He  learned  that 
trick  by  trying  to  imitate 
Thurston,  the  magician, 
who  was  his  boyhood  hero 


He  leaped  from  "The  Front  Page" — 
stage  version — right  into  the  film,  "Big 
Time."  And  Lee  Tracy  has  lived  up  to 
both  of  those  significant  titles  ever  since 


Oh,  come  now,  surely  you've  heard  that  one," 
he'll  grin.  "Well,  you  see,  it  seems  they  had 
someone,  or  maybe  a  crowd,  for  all  I  know, 
to  hold  me  up  on  the  other  side  of  the  set.  I 
was  er — that  is — I  was  supposed  to  be  slightly 
inebriated.  Falling  down  drunk,  if  you  don't 
understand  French. 

"And  then  when  the  director  was  ready  to 
shoot,  they'd  open  the  door  and  thrust  Mrs. 
Tracy's  little  boy  Lee  through  the  door  and 
before  I  landed  on  my  coco-bean,  they'd  snap 
me  making  a  grand  entrance." 

And  then  he'll  throw  back  his  head  and  roar. 

And  so  will  everyone  else  who  sees  "Blessed 
Event."  For  Lee  Tracy  walked  into  the  part 
left  vacant  by  the  irritated  Mr.  Cagney  and 
gave  a  performance  that  will  go  down  in 
movie  history  as  a  pip.  And  no  one  could  do 
that  and  be  slightly  swacked,  as  it  were. 

And  all  the  time  actors,  loafers  and  good 
time  boys  are  warning  Hollywood  against  the 
fickleness  of  Lee  Tracy,  the  studios  are  sitting 
up  on  their  haunches  howling  and  yowling  for 
little  Lee.     "We  want  Tracy,"  they  cry.

What  is  it  about 
this  lad  that  makes 
him  so  funny? 
Now,  honestly, 
that's  not  such  a 
comical  face.  He 
has  nice  eyes  and 
wavy  hair  and  looks 
well  in  his  clothes. 
But  there's  some- 
thing about  his 
voice.  That  voice 
made  him  a  star 


Stuart  Erwin's 
wife,  June  Collyer, 
heard  him  speak  on 
the  screen  long  be- 
fore she  met  him 
and  she  laughed 
until  she  cried. 
"But,  of  course," 
she  explained  later, 
"I  didn't  know  Stu, 
then."  They  are 
still  on  Hollywood's 
happiness   list 


It's   Ihe    Way  tie  S

t 


EVERYONE  in  Hollywood  likes 
him. 

But  no  one  can  understand 
why  he's  so  gosh-darned  funny. 

It  isn't  because  Stuart  Erwin  looks 
just  too  comical  for  words  that  people 
go  into  stitches  over  him. 

Shucks,  Hollywood  has  seen 
funnier  faces  than  Stu's.    Take  a  bird's-eye  view  of  Schnozzle 
Durante,  for  instance,  or  a  profile.     Or  a  Grand  Canyon  ex- 
posure of  Joe  E.  Brown.    Now,  there  are  faces  that  are,  what  I 
mean,  faces — ladies  and  gentlemen. 

But  Stu — why  there's  nothing  screamingly  funny  about  his 
face,  exactly. 

He  has  a  pair  of  steady  gray  eyes  that  look  kind  of  nice  and 
thoughtful.  His  mouth  sort  of  pouts,  but  what  does  that  prove? 
Mae  Murray  has  been  pouting  for  years  and  years,  and  no  one 
in  particular  has  been  rolling  in  any  aisles  at  Mae. 

And — why,  Stu's  even  got  wavy  hair.  Nice  deep  waves  and 
everything. 

Of  course,  he  looks  kind  of  dumb  when  he  wants  to,  but  so 
does  Will  Rogers,  for  that  matter.  And  Garbo.  And  Mickey 
Mouse,  and  a  lot  of  people  that  are  running  around  loose  in 
Hollywood  that  are  dumb  like  a  flock  of  foxes. 

So  that  can't  be  why  he's  so  funny,  right  in  broad  daylight, 
off  the  screen  as  well  as  on.  Nor  it  isn't  his  acting  exactly,  for 
Stu  himself  complains  about  that. 

"I've  got  all  my  gestures  figured  out,  see,"  he  explains,  "be- 
fore I  ever  begin  a  scene.  Boy,  I  mean  I've  got  gestures  and 
things  ready  that  is  acting.  But  do  I  ever  get  a  chance  to  show 
'em?  Do  I?"  he  insists.  "Oh  no.  Before  I  can  twirl  dramat- 
ically about,  quivering,  and  say  scornfully,  'So  it's  you,  is  it. 
you  so  and  so,'  why,  they've  laughed. 
They  just  naturally  laugh  for  no  D  p 

reason.  Jf  y     OflTO

Every  time  that  Stuart 
Erwin  speaks,  Holly- 
wood just  dies  laughing 


"It's  got  me  whipped.-' 
It  needn't.    For  Stuart  Erwin  has 
one  of  the  rarest  possessions  in  Holly- 
wood.   Has  it  and  doesn't  know  it. 

He  has  the  only  voice  in  Hollywood 

with   the  priceless  quality  of  being 

funny  without  anything  particularly 

funny  to  say. 

It's  just  funny.     A  come-to-Stuie-voice  that  caresses,  that 

tickles  the  hearer  exactly  as  if  a  straw  had  been  waved  beneath 

the  nose.    A  soft,  caressing  little  voice  that  annoys  pleasantly 

like  a  feather  in  one's  ear. 

His  funnybone  is  in  his  throat.  And  that  hesitant,  quiet, 
easy,  breathless,  rural  little  way  of  speaking,  that  dying  down 
in  the  middle  of  a  sentence  where  no  living,  breathing  person 
would  think  of  halting,  that  gentle  strangling  of  the  last  word 
in  every  statement,  that  tantalizing  tone,  always  brings  forth  a 
chuckle,  a  giggle,  a  titter,  a  guffaw  or  a  shout. 

HAVE  you  got  something,  Stuart!     Dietrich  can  keep  her 
legs,  Garbo  her  eyelashes  and  Chevalier  his  accent,  and  yes, 
his  lower  lip,  too,  for  what  the  Erwin  boy  has  got  is  plenty. 

The  director  on  a  certain  set  was  in  a  rage.  A  gorgeous,  deep 
purple  rage.  Things  had  gone  wrong  all  morning.  The  leading 
lady  had  arrived  twenty  minutes  late.  The  lights  went  blooey 
and  the  leading  man  had  a  boil  and  couldn't  sit  down  in  the 
love  scenes. 

It  was  awful.  Life  was  just  a  mockery,  the  director  decided. 
A  hollow  mockery.  He  stormed  up  and  down  the  set.  He  was 
through.  Through  with  the  whole  crazy,  insane  business.  He 
would  leave  that  minute,  no  later,  for  home.  Back  to  the  old 
country  for  him  where  people  arrived  on  time  and  heroes  did 
not  get  boils. 
Yj  .   j  The  stage  door  opened  softly.

Starring  The  New  Trends 


THE  furless  coat  is  being  billed  right  up  among  the  brightlights  of 
new  fashions  this  fall.  Katherine  Hepburn,  a  new  bright  star  her- 
self, wears  the  favorite  mannish  tailored  coat  of  Hollywood.  A  rich 
red  woolen  is  given  a  decided  swagger  by  a  double  breasted  cut. 
Wide  lapels  give  the  important  top  interest — note  the  slash  pockets. 
You  will  see  Katherine  smartly  wearing  this  in  "Bill  of  Divorcement." 


WHEN  you  see  Kay  Francis  in  "One  Way  Passage,"  don't  fail 
to  look  for  this  very  wearable  black  woolen  dress.  It  is  just  the 
sort  of  thing  to  choose  for  your  first  fall  outfit.  A  detailed  sketch, 
shown  below  with  the  photograph,  gives  you  an  idea  of  how 
smartly  cut  it  is.  The  seaming  is  used  diagonally  on  bodice  and 
skirt.  Flaring  cuffs  of  the  fabric  stress  the  sleeves.  A  trick  leather 
belt  has  a  bow  studded  with  nail  heads.     Collar  of  white  satin.

HOLLYWOOD  FASHIONS 

sponsored  by  Photoplay  Magazine  and  worn 
by  famous  stars  in  latest  motion  pictures  now 
may  be  secured  for  your  own  wardrobe 
from  leading  department  and  ready-to-wear 
stores  in  many  localities  .  .  .  Faithful  copies 
of  these  smartly  styled  and  moderately-priced 
garments,  of  which  those  shown  in  this  issue 
of  Photoplay  Magazine  are  typical,  are  on 
display  this  month  in  the  stores  of  those 
representative  merchants  whose  firm  names 
appear  on   Page   121. 


EVENING  clothes  have  a  new  purpose  this  year — 
they  have  a  five-'til-midnight"  personality, 
like  this  stunning  white  crepe  gown,  at  left. 
Adrienne  Ames  wears  this  in  "Guilty  As  Hell. 
All  the  interest  centers  at  the  top  where  a  tucked 
guimpe  buttons  high  at  the  neck,  and  tucked  sleeves 
give  a  covered  shoulder  line.  Rings  of  brown  fur 
circle  the  armholes.      Note  the  straight  silhouette. 


ADRIENNE  again,  at  left,  in  a 
stunning  cape  ensemble.  A 
contrasting  blouse  has  leg  o'  mutton 
sleeves  with  cuffs  of  the  dress  fabric. 


J_L  of  the  costumes  Adrienne  wears  in  "Guilty 
As  Hell,"  show  important  fashion  trends. 
Look  closely  at  the  details  of  this  trim  woolen 
dress,  at  right.  It  has  the  slim,  straight  silhouette 
with  neckline  closing  at  the  base  of  the  throat. 
The  sleeves  are  wide  at  the  armholes,  tapering 
to  the  wrists.  A  side-front  closing  is  marked 
with  loops  of  the  fabric.  Adrienne's  dress  is 
a  violet-blue,  but  you  may  buy  it  in  several  colors 
— and  without  the  silver  fox  lei  scarf,  shown 
here.  Sixteen  button  suede  gloves,  black  suede 
shoes  and  an  unusually  shaped  black  suede  bag 
with  silver  trim  are  accessories.    Tricky  belt,  too. 


LEILA  HYAMS  wears  a  dress  you  are  all  going  to  want! 
-  Here  it  is  at  the  right,  and  isn't  it  smart?  The  dress  is 
simplicity  personified  but  the  unusual  collar  that  flares  down 
one  side  and  just  reaches  around  the  neck  on  the  other, 
gives  it  a  special  dash.  The  butcher  cuffs  are  new,  too. 
Both  cuffs  and  the  collar  are  in  the  new  rough  satin.  The 
dress  is  a  pebbled  black  crepe — those  white  buttons  are 
adroitly  placed.       See  this  soon   in  "The  Big  Broadcast." 


SLEEVES,  as  you  know,  are  the 
pet  child  of  fashion  this  season. 
They  do  all  sorts  of  gay  things  as  on 
this  wool  frock  of  Myrna  Loy's, 
sketched  left.  The  drop  shoulder 
line  with  the  sleeves  puffing  out 
below  is  very  new.  The  buttons 
and  the  unusual  use  of  cording  are 
good  details.    In  "Thirteen  Women." 


HERE'S  an  idea  for 
making  over  last 
year's  bunny  coat.  Ver- 
ree  Teasdale  wears  a 
brief  white  ermine  jacket 
with  armlets  of  fox.  A 
tie  at  the  neckline  and 
again  at  the  waist,  is 
different.  And  note  the 
jeweled    pin    in    front.

THERE  S  a  Victorian  flavor  to  this  red  woolen  dress 
which  you  see  Katherine  Hepburn  wearing  in  the 
sketch  at  left.  The  demure  high  neckline,  the  epaulet 
capes  on  the  shoulders,  and  the  fitted  bodice  o«e  all 
reminiscent  of  your  grandmother's  time.  That  trick  belt 
buckle   is  wooden.      See  this  in    "Bill   of  Divorcement. 


FOR  all  the  traveling  Kay  Francis  does  in  "One  Way 
Passage,"'  this  coat,  sketched  below,  is  the  perfect 
choice.  It  is  one  of  those  practical  affairs  that  you  can 
wear  with  or  without  a  separate  fur  piece.  Clever  criss- 
cross collar— and  the  sleeves  have  a  jacket-like  cut. 
Kay's  coat  is  a  beige-brown  plaid  but  you  may  buy  it  in 
a  smart  two-toned  tweed.  Her  shallow  crowned  felt 
with  scalloped  brim   is  new  and  different — it's  brown 


Here  is  the  third  and  last  of  this  year's  Cut  Picture  Puzzle  series.  All  the  men  are  married.  One 
is  English,  one  Hungarian  and  the  other  American.  All  have  brown  hair.  Two  of  the  women 
have  never  been  married.  One  has  recently  re-married.  One  has  a  beautiful  singing  voice  and 
all  came  from  the  stage  to  pictures.     One  has  been  called  "The  First  Lady  of  the  Screen"

nice  hands  that  you're  nut  ashamed  to 
play  bridge.  Many  women  miss  the 
fun  of  playing  cards  because  they  have 
ugly  hands. 

Lots  of  folks  say  that  a  tiny  hand  is 
the  most  beautiful.  That's  bunk.  A 
large  hand  can  be  as  lovely  as  any,  if  it 
has  character,  is  lean  and  is  well  cared 
for.  I  don't  know  what  people  mean 
when  they  say  Garbo's  is  a  peasant's 
hand.  It's  a  big  hand — that's. true — 
but  I've  seen  plenty  of  society  women 
with  big  hands. 

THE  worst  looking  hand  is  a  pudgy 
one  and  I  can  tell  you  how  to  get 
rid  of  that  fat,  just  as  I  've  told  you  how 
to  get  rid  of  fat  on  your  stomach. 

First  of  all  —  here's  the  general 
routine  for  lovely  hands.  Wash  the 
hands  in  lukewarm  water  and  soap 
every  night.  Rinse  them  carefully  in 
lukewarm  water  and  dry  them  gently. 
Then,  with  feeding  cream,  massage  the 
hands  with  the  same  movement  you 
use  to  put  on  a  tight  glove,  being  care- 
ful not  to  neglect  in  between  the 
lingers,  and  continue  the  pulling  on  of 
a  glove  idea  over  your  wrist  and  fore- 
arm, paying  particular  attention  to  the 
elbows.  Do  this  for  about  ten  minutes 
and  then,  with  the  cream  still  on,  sleep 
in  a  pair  of  loose  kid  gloves. 

In  the  morning  wipe  the  cream  off 
with  tissue  and,  after  your  bath  or 
shower,  gently  rub  lotion  into  the  hands.    Do  this  for  one  week 

that's  all  I  ask  you,  just  give  it  one  week's  trial.  You'll  be 
amazed  at  how  lovely  your  hands  will  look. 

Now,  that's  the  general  routine.  Here  are  some  of  the  in- 
dividual problems.  Girls  who  use  typewriters  or  play  the  piano 
for  any  great  period  of  time  are  inclined  to  have  blunt,  stubby 
lingers.     This  can  absolutely  be  corrected.    I  know  it.    It  can

easily,  that  s  a  sign  something  is  lacking 
in  your  system.  In  that  case  drink  a 
small  glass  of  orange  juice  in  the 
middle  of  the  afternoon  and  eat  plenty 
of  cottage  cheese. 

Here's  another  excellent  dish  to 
supply  the  system  with  what  it  re- 
quires. Allow  a  pint  of  milk  to  sour. 
Dip  up  about  a  soup-dish  full  of  this 
clabbered  milk.  Into  this  put  a  hand- 
fid  of  stale  pumper-nickel  bread  that 
has  been  grated.  Add  a  tablespoonful 
of  brown  sugar.  This  makes  an  excel 
lent  dish  and  one  upon  which  you 
could  make  your  entire  lunch.  It's  an 
"old  country  dish"  and  I'll  bet  that 
Garbo  is  enjoying  it  right  this  very 
minute  in  Sweden. 

Don't  overload  your  hands  with 
rings.  Make  your  hands  useful  and 
vigorous  looking.  Nothing  looks  so 
awful  as  an  anemic  hand.  Do  things 
with  your  hands — if  it's  only  to  make 
gestures  as  you  talk,  but  above  all 
things  don't  let  them  just  hang  lifeless 
at  your  sides.    Get  pep  in  your  hands. 

IF  your  hands  are  too  thin  the  rest  of 
vour  be 


body  is  probably  too  thin,  too, 
and  the  only  thing  to  do  is  to  build 
yourself  up  generally.     But  remember 
that  you  can  mold  the  hands  to  suit 
yourself,  by  pinching,  squeezing  and 
kneading  as  I've  shown  you  how  to  do 
this  month.  Beauty  can  be  hand-made. 
Large  veins  usually  mean  poor  circulation  and  the  way  to  get 
good  circulation  is  to  get  up  and  do  things.     Get  some  life  into 
yourself.     Get  a  little  pep.     But  hard  work  also  causes  large 
veins  and  there  is  not  much  that  can  be  done  for  them  then  ex- 
cept to  hold  the  hands  above  your  head  for  a  little  while  before 
you  go  out  and  then  sit  so  the  hands  are  a  little  higher  than 
the  arms  and  the  blood  has  a  chance  to  run  away  from  the  hands. 


n: 


Fingers  made  blunt,  stubby  by 
pounding  a  typewriter  can  be 
molded  into  long  tapering  ones 


Here  is  the  way  to  squeeze  ex- 
cess fat  off  of  ugly,  pudgy  hands. 
You  must  use  a  good  firm  grip 


Make  the  muscles  tense.  Draw 
in  fingers  like  this.  Relax  and 
repeat.     It   will   reduce   hands 


For  red  hands  use  a  good  bleaching  cream  every  other  night 
and  the  feeding  cream  on  alternate  nights.  Avoid  hot  water  and 
don't  expose  the  hands  to  cold  or  wind.  Always  wear  gloves. 
And  don't  neglect  the  general  hand  routine  and  the  "glove 
movement"  massage.  There!  If  you  don't  get  pretty  hands 
it's  your  own  fault.    I've  told  you  how  to  do  it,  now  go  to  it. 

And  now  for  the  feet.  You  shouldn't  need  me  to  tell  you  to 
have  properly  fitted  shoes,  but  there  are  a  lot  of  silly  women 
who  still  persist  in  squeezing  their  poor 
feet  into  shoes  too  small  for  them.  I've 
told  you  often  enough  just  what  a  lovely 
carriage  can  do  for  your  figure  and  you 
certainly  can't  have  a  lovely  carriage  if 
your  feet  have  corns  and  bunions.  You 
won't  look  pretty  if  your  face  is  drawn 
up  into  wrinkles  because  your  feet 
hurt.  Go  to  the  chiropodist  every 
second  week.  It's  not  a  luxury.  It's  as 
important  as  having  your  hair  done  and 
your  nails  manicured. 

Now,  here's  the  way  to  walk.  Put 
your  feet  straight  in  front  of  you.  In 
fact,  rather  than  spread  your  feet  at  an 
angle — as  some  of  you  were  taught  to  do 
in  school — walk  a  little  pigeon-toed. 
Look  at  Joan  Crawford's  walk.  Isn't  it 
graceful?  She  is  slightly  pigeon-toed. 
Gloria  Swanson  has  the  most  beautiful 
feet  of  any  star.  She  walks  with  her 
feet  absolutely  straight  in  front  of  her. 


THIS  month  you  see  pictures  of  the 
right  and  wrong  way  to  walk.  Get  a 
spring  into  your  step.  Step  on  the 
entire  foot  at  once  but  don't  come  down 
too  hard  on  the  heels.  Walk  lightly,  as 
if  you  liked  just  moving  yourself  along, 
as  if  you  really  were  going  somewhere 
and  felt  life  coursing  through  every 
vein.  You  will  spring  along  the  street  if 
your  feet  are  comfortable. 

Flat  heels — absolutely  flat  ones — are 
not  good  for  most  people,  except  for 
playing  tennis.    A  medium  heel,  like  the 


For   Girls  Who 
Stand    All    Day 


one  in  the  picture,  is  best  for  walking  and  everv-day  use.  High 
heels,  in  the  evening,  are  all  right.  Be  sure  that  your  shoe  is 
long  enough  for,  as  with  hands,  it  is  not  always  the  small  foot 
that  is  the  most  beautiful. 

I've  shown  you  a  daily  exercise  that  you  should  take  to  avoid 

fallen  arches.    Lean  back  on  your  heels  and  then  come  up  high 

on  your  toes.    Do  this  twenty  or  thirty  times  a  day.    It  will  also 

strengthen  the  calves  of  your  legs.     And  don't  overlook  the 

advice  I've  given  to  girls  who  stand  all 

day.     I've  given  that  same  advice  to 

hundreds    of    stars.      Remember    that 

they,  too,  work  hard — as  hard  as  the 

clerk  or  saleslady,  and  not  only  do  they 

stand  for  hours  at  a  time,  but  they  stand 

under  those  burning  lights. 


If  your  feet  swell  from  standing  a 
great  deal  or  from  any  other  cause, 
here  is  the  cure. 

Have  two  pails  of  water — one  as 
hot  as  you  can  stand  it  and  one  cold. 
Soak  the  feet  alternately  in  the  hot 
and  cold  water,  a  few  minutes  in 
each,  for  about  fifteen  minutes  al- 
together. Dry  them  well  and  then 
apply  rubbing  alcohol  with  the 
hands,  working  the  alcohol  well 
into  the  feet  and  ankles. 

Then,  for  ten  minutes,  lie  on  a 
couch  or  bed,  with  pillows  under 
the  knees  so  that  the  feet  are  higher 
than  the  head.     Relax  completely. 

This  will  not  only  reduce  swell- 
ing but  it  will  make  the  feet  and 
ankles  permanently  thinner. 

Sylvia  has  given  this  remedy  to 
hundreds  of  stars  who  stand  under 
the  hot  studio  lights  for  hours  at  a 
time.  It  is  invaluable  for  sales- 
women and  all  girls  who  must  be 
on  their  feet  a  large  part  of  the  time. 


NOW  girls — go  to  it!  See  that  your 
hands  and  your  feet  are  as  well 
cared  for  as  your  letters  have  told  me 
your  figures  and  your  faces  are. 

And  don't  fail  to  listen  to  Sylvia's 
little  talk  in  next  month's  issue  of 
Photoplay.

IF  Helen  Hayes  had  her  way  she 
would  dust  her  own  furniture, 
darn  her  husband's  socks  and 
clean  her  own  shoes.  Honestly! 
And  I'm  not  trying  to  hand  you  one 
of  those  "bored  with  fame"  stories. 

Helen  hates  the  headlines  and  the 
poor  girl  has  had  her  share  of  them. 
While  Gloria  Swanson,  Constance 
Bennett    and   Joan   Crawford   have 

skilfully  kept  their  names  before  the  public,  Helen  has  asked 
for  privacy  only.  But  she  hasn't  been  able  to  manage  it. 
Her  name  has  again  and  again  taken  the  place  coveted  by 
others. 

In  reality  she  is  a  quiet  woman — a  homey,  domestic  sort  of 
person — a  woman  made  for  the  placid  back  waters  of  life,  yet 
because  she  was  born  with  a  divine  genius  (recall  what  she  did 
to  your  emotions  in  "The  Sin  of  Madelon  Claudet"  and 
"Arrowsmith")  she  has  been  thrust  into  the  mad  ballyhoo 
of  first  the  stage  and  then  the  movies. 

And  her  private  life  has  been  flung  across  the  newspapers  of 
the  world.  Take  the  recent  case,  for  instance.  Four  years 
after  her  marriage  her  husband's  ex-wife  sued  Helen  for 
alienation  of  affection.  It  is  just  one  of  the  many  suits  that 
the  first  Mrs.  Charlie  MacArthur  has  brought  against  Helen 
Hayes  MacArthur  which  shoved  her  into  a  front  page  position. 

Then  there  was  the  famous  "Act  of  God"  baby. 

Helen's  lips  quiver  when  you  mention  that.  "It  will  follow 
the  child  through  life,"  she  says. 

Helen  Hayes — of  all  people  to  be  involved  in  headlines  — 
when  she  hates  them  so  much!  For  if  she  had  her  way  the 
papers  would  never  mention  her  except  to  discuss  her  pro- 
fessional performances. 

Hit  marriage  t<>  the  tempestuous,  temperamental  genius- 
author  Charlie  MacArthur  has  caused  her  much  of  the  head- 


Al though  she  dislikes 
publicity  Helen  Hayes 
discusses  her  marriage 
with  utter  frankness 


line  publicity.  And  yet,  sorry  though 
she  may  be  that  the  blatant  pub- 
licity trumpets  have  blared  near  her, 
she  never  regrets  her  marriage. 

Helen  should  have  fallen  in  love 
with  a  quietly  dominant,  thought- 
ful type  of  man.  Instead  she  gave 
her  heart  to  Charlie  MacArthur, 
whose  sensational  moves  and  eccen- 
tricities would  fill  a  five  foot  shelf  of 
Aery  readable  books.  Charlie  is  a  genius  and  he  behaves  as 
geniuses  are  publicized  as  behaving. 

I  think  an  incident  that  Helen  told  me  recently  about 
Charlie  describes  him  pretty  well. 

Never,  in  the  four  years  that  she  has  been  married,  has  she 
been  able  to  make  him  jealous.  She  tried  telling  him  about 
the  impassioned  love  scenes  that  she  and  Gary  Cooper  were 
doing  in  "A  Farewell  to  Arms,"  but  Charlie  would  not  nibble 
at  the  bait.  She  often  quoted  nattering  remarks  that  men  had 
made  to  her  —  only  to  discover  that  Charlie  smiled  with  per- 
fect equanimity. 

BUT  not  long  ago  a  man  sat  down  at  a  table  with  friends 
and  did  some  very  steady  drinking.  Although  the  liquid  in 
the  tall  glasses  was  not  ice  water,  it  might  have  been  for  all 
the  effect  it  had  upon  him.  The  next  day  Helen  said  to  Charlie, 
"At  last  I  have  beheld  the  perfect  drinker.  The  way  that  man 
holds  his  liquor  is  magnificent." 

"Huh,"  Charlie  replied.  "I  could  be  a  magnificent  drinker, 
too,  if  I  wanted  to. " 

In  relating  the  incident,  Helen's  eyes  sparkled.  "He  was 
simply  furious  with  jealousy,"  she  giggled. 

Last  year  Charlie  went  to  Europe  for  eight  weeks,  alone. 
Later,  he  took  a  trip  to  Bermuda — without  Helen.  Because 
he  is  not  only  a  genius  but  acts  [  please  turn  to  page  127  ] 


Doug,  Jr.  Walks  &  lalks 


An  interview  set  to  a  pacing  Marathon. 
Jnst  that  inimitable  Fairbanks  touch 


By    Carlisle 
Jo  n  es 


DOUGLAS     FAIRBANKS,     JR.,     took     a 
Russian  orchestra  along    with  him  on  a 
recent  trip  to  Mexico  on  a  leased  yacht. 
He  invited  them  one  night  at  the  Russian 
American  Art  Club  in  Hollywood,  where  he  and  some 
friends  had  gone  under  pretense  of  getting  atmos- 
phere for  Doug's  picture,  "Scarlet  Dawn." 

It  seemed  like  a  good  idea  at  the  time. 

As  a  matter  of  fact  there  was  no  extra  cabin  room 
on  the  yacht  for  the  five  orchestra  members,  but  the 
prospect  of  floating  idly  about  in  tropical  waters  with 
a  Russian  orchestra  on  deck,  strumming  soft  accom- 
paniments to  day  dreams,  was  too  interesting  to 
resist. 

It  developed  that  there  was  no  time  for  day  dreams 
on  that  two  weeks'  bachelor  cruise  and  that  Russian 
orchestras  do  not  strum.  Doug  and  the  three  other 
young  men  who  shared  expenses  with  him  on  this 
particular  venture  took  turns  helping  a  short-handed 
crew  and  there  is  more  than  a  suspicion  that  the 
orchestra  members,  too,  were  pressed  into  sailor 
service  during  a  couple  of  stormy  days  at  sea. 

And  if  you  have  ever  tried  to  do  one  of  those  sit- 
ting down  Russian  dances,  you  know  how  restful  a 
Russian  orchestra  can  be.  Anyway,  it  didn't  cost 
much  to  have  them  along.  They  came  as  guests — ■ 
not  as  paid  entertainers. 

Somehow  or  other,  that  Russian  orchestra  incident 
seems  to  be  significant  in  Doug's  case.  He  is  always 
planning  to  be  lazy,  always  hoping  for  the  chance  to 
practice  indolence,  forever  on  the  verge  of  letting 
down — and  never  actually  doing  it.  He  is  as  restless 
mentally  as  he  is  physically. 

He  plans  more  than  he  can  possibly  do  and  then 
does  more  than  he  planned.  He  is  the  type  who  runs 
up  a  hill  and  saunters  down,  who  works,  as  he  says, 
"like  the  devil  to  get  through  with  a  job  when  I 
know  it's  got  to  be  done,"  but  wrho  approaches  it 
with  reluctance,  although  generally  at  full  speed. 

Take  this  interview,  for  instance. 
Doug  was  a  willing  subject. 

"I've  some  ideas,"  he  said. 
"Suppose  you  come  out  to  the 
house  some  —  some  afternoon. 
When  we've  finished  going  over 
this  new  script." 

"Fine." 

A  FEW  days  later  he  reminded 
himself  of  the  appointment. 

"I've  some  ideas,"  he  said. 
"Suppose  you  come  out  some 
morning.  Take  a  sun  bath  with 
me.  I've  got  to  get  a  coat  of  tan 
for  this  new  picture."  He  rubbed 
his  closely  cropped  head.  "  Got  to 
get  my  head  tanned,  too." 

"  Good  idea." 

Later  in  the  same  week  Doug 
called  on  the  telephone.     "About 

that  interview,"  he  said,  "I've  got  some  ideas.  But  I'm  leaving 
tomorrow  night  for  two  weeks  in  Mexico.  Suppose  I  meet  you 
at  the  studio — in  half  an  hour."  An  hour  later  Doug  was 
there.  He  sat  still  long  enough  to  light  a  cigarette.  Then  he 
began  pacing  the  floor.  "I  thought  perhaps  we  could  dope 
out  a  story  about  my  having — having — "  he  felt  for  the  right 
word,  but  didn't  seem  to  find  it — "having  sort  of  arrived." 


A  mere  boy  (left)  engagingly  frank  and  un- 
critical, Douglas  Fairbanks,  Jr.  possesses  a 
virility  that  permits  him  to  depict  convincingly 
the  strong  soldier  type  in  "Scarlet  Dawn." 
And   Nancy    Carroll    seems    to    think    so,  too 


"Certainly,"  I  agreed.  "I  can  say  that  you  think 
'Scarlet  Dawn,'  will  be  the  finest  picture  you  will  ever 
make — that  you  have  reached  the — the  peak  of  your 
artistic  career  as  an  actor." 

"  Good  Lord,  no,"  said  Doug.  "  Don't  say  that.  If 
I  thought  that  I'd  go  shoot  myself  this  afternoon  at  the  corner 
of  Hollywood  and  Vine — or  some  place.  I  haven't  started  to 
do  the  things  I  want  to  do.    Don't  say  that!" 

"Well,  then,  we  can  say  that  you've  arrived  at  financial  in- 
dependence so  young  that  you  hope  to  do  all  the  things  you 
want  to  do — later — without  financial  worry.  We'll  say  you 
have  'arrived'  financially."  [  please  turn  to  page  122  ]

you  each  month 


P\IANE   SINCLAIR    is    much 

L^elated  over  her  new  dry 
shampoo.  It  takes  only  fifteen 
minutes,  is  odorless  and  non- 
inflammable.  Grand  for  that 
sudden  date  and  as  a  wave-saver 


THOROUGH  brushing  is 
I  one  of  the  beauty  secrets 
of  Una  Merkel's  curly,  golden 
hair.  But  notice  that  Una's 
brushings  are  no  meek  pats. 
Instead,  they  are  strong, 
sweeping  strokes  that  sepa- 
rate and  brush  every  strand, 
distribute  oil,  cleanse  the 
hair  and  leave  it  glimmering. 
Rub  your  brush  clean  on  a 
towel  after  brushing  each 
strand.  Una  finishes  each 
shampoo  with  a  lemon  rinse, 
especially  glorifying  for  light 
hair.  Use  the  juice  of  two 
lemons  in  a  bowl  of  tepid 
water  as  the  final  rinse.  Cam- 
omile tea  is  also  a  good  old 
dependable  for  keeping  the 
life   and    gold    in    your    hair 


CECILIA  PARKER  enjoys  shampooing  with  that  big 
sponge.  She  finds  it  leaves  her  hair  beautifully  clean 
and  soft.  Use  the  pads  of  the  fingers  in  rotary  movements 
for  cleansing  the  scalp,  and  the  sponge  for  the  hair. 
Cecilia  believes  that  a  liquid  shampoo  is  better  for  the 
hair  and  is  easier  to  use.      Remember  to  rinse  thoroughly

lines  on  that  gentle  arch — an  artifice  "by

deeper  emphasis  at  the  lash- 
line.  For  evening,  shadow 
may  be  used  more  generous- 
ly and  over  a  larger  area. 
But  beware  of  shadow

gives   a    world-weary    effect 


A  LITTLE  brilliantine  is  a 
'  *  decided  aid  to  hair  chic 
and  beauty.  Bette  Davis 
finds  that  a  practical  way  to 
use  it  is  in  an  atomizer  made 
especially  for  the  heavier 
hair  lotions.  Her  shoulder- 
length  bob  is  worn  straight 
at  top,  softly  banged  and 
loosely  permanented  at  ends, 
one  of  the  nicest  arrange- 
ments   for    the    younger    girl 


COIFFURE  Classique,  especially  created  for  Tala  Birell,  the  Viennese  star, 
may  sugsest  some  charming  arrangement  for  your  own  hair.  If  your  hair- 
line is  good;  that  backward  sweep  from  the  face  is  often  a  strikingly  in- 
dividualistic touch.  You  need  several  inches  of  hair  for  that  first  arc  of 
curls.  The  under  hair  must  be  shorter  and  thinner  to  permit  those  rows  of 
curls  to  remain  in  place  without  pins.      Good  with   these  tilted   autumn   hats 


From    the    right,    the    head

Lovely,  isn't  it?    And  very

IFyou  are  young  and  just  a 
do  for  your  hair  is  to  leave 


little  lovely  one  of  the  nicest  things  you  can 
your  hair  is  to  leave  it  in  its  natural  state  without  much  fuss  and 
fixing.  Constance  Cummings'  arrangement  with  that  modified  bang 
and  the  fluffed  ends  is  typical  of  all  that  is  simple  and  charming.  School 
girls,  debutantes  and  young  girls  in  business,  take  a  lesson  from  this 
star  and  look  your  loveliest.     As  accommodating  for  evening  as  for  day 


There  are  gentle  little  curls 
and  a  part  at  the  right  side 


The  piece  de  resistance  of

WHICH  of  these  lovely  stars  do  you

be  charming  little  Virginia  Lee  Corbin,  who 
is  only  eighteen.  But,  too,  it  may  be  the

nrilAT  romance  between  Norma  Talmadge 
and  Georgie  Jessel  has  a  way  of  bobbing  up 
fresh  as  an  extra  girl's  wisecrack  despite  fre- 
quent denials.  Georgie  arrived  in  Hollywood 
recently  by  plane.  Xorma's  car  met  him  at 
the  landing  held.  "Certainly  Norma  and  I 
intend  to  marry,"  Mr.  Jessel  told  the  reporters, 
"we  are  in  love  with  each  other." 

Norma  alighted  from  the  car,  spied  the  re- 
porters, heard  George's  confession  and  made  a 
bee  line  back  to  the  car.    The  astonished  Mr. 


was  snatched  into  the  car,  the  blinds 
were  drawn  and  the  auto  sped  away.  "No 
romance.      Just    business,"    Norma    told    the 

p.ipers. 

A  ND  now  the  frozen  faced  Buster  Keaton 
""must  go  his  own  way,  alone.  Mrs.  Keaton 
has  secured  her  divorce  and  the  custody  of  the 
two  children.  Buster,  it  seems,  would  stay  out 
late  and  cause  Mrs.  Keaton  no  end  of  worry. 
Constance  Talmadge,  sister  of  Mrs.  Keaton, 
was  witness  for  her  sister.  And  Buster  doesn't 
have  much  to  say  about  it. 

V\  TELL,  it  looks  as  if  the  movie  career  of 
W  Michael  Farmer,  husband  of  Gloria 
Swanson,  is  over  before  it  started.  Gloria  was 
anxious  to  have  her  husband  play  the  romantic 
lead,  but  Michael  just  couldn't  act. 

He  tried  hard  enough,  goodness  knows,  but 
just  as  soon  as  he  would  appear  before  the 
camera  something  would  happen.  His  garter 
would  break  or  Michael  would  have  to  sneeze. 
It  was  awful.  Finally  they  gave  him  a  car  to 
drive  and  believe  it  or  not  the  engine  went  dead 
in  the  middle  of  a  scene.  So  Michael  excused 
himself  and  made  a  grand  exit  from  the  acting 
profession.     He  promised  to  do  anything  for 


Gloria  except  be  an  actor.    And  Gloria,  some- 
how, feels  he's  right.

baby  and  be  just  that  happy  about  it. 

When  Carol  Lee  Stuart,  tiny  daughter  of 
Nick  Stuart  and  Sue  Carol  was  born,  Nick  re-

there  whenever  a  new  baby  is  born  all  the 
friends  must  gather  together  to  sing  songs  and 
make  toasts  and  Nick  is  a  Roumanian  lad. 
Little  Carol  was  born  at  three  a.m.  Half  an 
hour  later  Nick  had  all  his  friends  on  the  phone 
demanding  their  presence  at  the  house.  Bing 
Crosby,  who  lives  just  next  door,  protested  the 
loudest  about  getting  out  of  bed.  But  nothing 
can  be  done  with  a  jubilant  father.  He  and

WHERE  A  "PULLED"  SEAM  WOULD 

COST  THOUSANDS 


Ann  Dvorak  and  David  Manners  in  a  scene  from  "The  Crooner",  a 
First  National  Picture.  Skinner's  Troubleproof  Crepe  scores  both 
smartness  and  dependability  before  the  critical  eye  of  the  camera. 


A' PULLED"  seam  .  .  .  the  slightest  rip  and  production 
stops  when  a  star's  gown  gives  way  under  the  stress 
and  strain  of  movie  acting.  And  when  production  is  held 
up,  even  for  a  few  minutes  while  a  seamstress  makes  repairs, 
costs  go  up  .  .  .  impatient  tempers  blaze  .  .  .  scenes  have 
to  be  retaken  ...  a  bad  time  is  had  by  all. 

Such  situations  have  taught  Hollywood  studios  to  use 
materials  they  can  depend  on.  They  know  there  are  silks 
to  be  had  which  stand  the  strain  of  action  scenes  —  silks 
which  come  from  the  looms  of  William  Skinner  &  Sons. 

Skinner's  Troubleproof  Crepe !  A  favorite  today  in 
Hollywood.  Wovea  of  specially -twisted  threads  which 
make  it  four  times  as  strong  as  ordinary  crepes  at  the  seams. 
Pre-shrunk  and  fast  color — can  be  washed  repeatedly.  Pure- 
dye,  with  soft  draping  qualities  and  lovely  dull  texture  — 
pleasing  to  the  stars  for  their  smartest  gowns. 

A  favorite  also  with  women  everywhere  who  have  to 
watch  their  pennies  — this  Troubleproof  Crepe.  With  so 
many  dress  fabrics  now  on  the  market,  with  extravagant 
claims  made  for  nameless  goods  that  quickly  go  to  pieces, 
it  is  striking  evidence  that  by  paying  a  fair  price,  you  can 
obtain  silks  in  which  you  can  place  implicit  confidence.

one  evening  when  the  door  hell  ran;;. 

"Good  heavens,  I  hope  that's  no  one  who 
will  interrupt  this  game, "  she  said  as  she  cocked 
her  ear  to  listen  for  the  butler's  greeting. 

She  heard  nothing.  Finally,  she  led  her 
guests  to  the  front  door.  Jerry,  the  butler,  was 
bending  over  a  market  basket  and  pulling  away 
an  old  pied-  of  blanket. 

"Oh,  Lord,"  moaned  Marie.  "It's  an  aban- 
doned baby.  " 

Hut  it  was  just  a  baby  alley  cat.  A  card  was 
attached  to  tin  basket  which  read:  "From  the 
kids  in  your  block.    With  love.'' 

.Marie  added  the  kitten  to  her  family  of 
Strays.  And,  of  course,  there'll  be  an  ice  cream 
cone  party  of  appreciation  for  the  gang  of  kids 
who  live  near  her.

at  the  opening  of  " Strange  Interlude, " 

folks  began  to  wonder  just  how  long  she  had 
been  wearing  that  black  wig.  You've  prob- 
ably heard  about  the  gag.  She  and  Alexander 
Kirkland  went  to  the  picture.  Kirkland  intro- 
duced the  dark  haired  miss  with  a  broad  South- 
ern accent  as  a  visitor  from  out  of  town.  She 
met  all  the  movie  stars  and  was  "so  thrilled."' 

One  director  even  offered  to  make  a  screen 
test  of  her  because  her  voice  was  so  beautiful 
and  the  only  person  who  caught  on — but  didn't 
spoil  the  fun  by  saying  anything— was  Elissa 
Eandi. 

But  there's  more  to  it  than  all  that.  Going 
about  in  a  dark  wig  is  one  of  Ann's  pet  stunts. 
That's  how  she  was  able  to  dodge  reporters  so 
successfully  during  the  period  when  she  was 


getting  her  divorce.  She  even  drove  around 
Hollywood  in  her  own  limousine,  posing  as  her 
own  maid. 

A  XX  first  got  the  idea  when,  upon  going  to 
a  concert  one  night,  she  was  held  up  in  the 
lobby  autographing  programs  and  missed  the 
first  number.  The  next  day  Ann  bought  the 
black  wig.  Just  to  make  sure  that  she  could 
get  away  with  it  she  tried  the  effect  out  on  her 
voice  teacher.  Samuel  Kayser,  with  whom  she 
had  studied  for  ten  years. 

For  an  hour  and  a  half  she  talked  to  him 
and  he,  after  listening  to  her  give  a  very  bad 
dramatic  reading  in  the  Southern  accent,  ad- 
vised her  to  give  up  the  idea  of  a  stage  career 
and  go  back  home. 

For  two  years  she  has  escaped  detection  but 
she  never  tried  the  stunt  before  at  such  a  grand 
occasion  as  a  Hollywood  premiere.  The  joke 
was  too  good  to  keep  and  within  a  week  it  was 
all  over  town. 

The  only  catch  is  that  now  Ann  has  to  think 
up  a  new  way  of  escaping  recognition. 

"J\TO\Y  isn't  this  funny?  Stars  who  make 
S5.000  a  week  and  more  complain  about 
their  salaries  and  walk  out  on  their  studios  be- 
cause they  think  they  are  worth  mote,  while  a 
kid  named  Robert  Young,  whose  popularity 
is  leaping  like  an  old  Ford  and  whose  fan  mail 
staggers  a  couple  of  postmen  every  morning, 
never  complains  about  his  S250,  out  of  which 
he  pays  an  agent  a  big  slice  and  supper! s  a 
family.  Bob  still  drives  his  old  car  and  pays 
S16.25  a  month  rent.

LUX  for  Underthings— 


yet  she  wears 
underthings  a 
SECOND  DAY 


Fresh  as  a  rose,  she  steps  from 
her  tub  and  then  —  too  often  she  puts 
on  yesterday's  lingerie! 

She  cant  escape  offending  when 
she  does  this!  For  all  healthy  people 
perspire,  and  underthings  absorb 
perspiration.  Even  though  we  don't 
notice  it  ourselves,  other  people  do. 
It  ruins  the  charming  effect  we  want 
to  make. 

Why  should  any  girl  run  such  a 
risk?  It's  so  easy  to  remove  the 
slightest  danger  of  offending.  For 
Lux  coaxes  out  every  trace  of  per- 
spiration acids  and  odors !  So  swiftly, 
too.  Just  4  minutes  Luxes  all  one 
day's  underthings — stockings,  too. 
Keeps  colors  and  fabrics  lovely  as 
new  so  much  longer.  Economical! 


Avoid  Offending  — 

Underthings  absorb  perspiration 
odor — Protect  daintiness 
this  ^--minute  way 

[  Wash  this  4-minute  way.  One  tablespoon 
of  Lux  does  one  clay's  undies  ,  .  .  stock- 
ings, too!  Use  lukewarm  water— Lux  dis- 
solves instantly  in  it.  Squeeze  suds 
through  fabric,  rinse  twice. 

2  Wash  after  each  wearing,  for  perspiration 
acids  left  in  silk  fade  colors  and  rot  threads. 
Lux  removes  perspiration  acids  and  odors 
completely — leaves  colors  and  fabrics 
like  new. 


•2  Avoid  ordinary  soaps  —  cakes,  powders, 
chips.  These  often  contain  harmful  alkali 
which  weakens  threads,  fades  color.  Lux 
has  no  harmful  alkali.  Anything  safe  in 
water  alone  is  sate  in  Lux.

J  When  director  Norman  Taurog's  new  baby 
girl  was  born,  Norman  asked  his  sister,  Mrs. 
Cooper,  to  be  godmother.  This  was  too  much 
for  Jackie.  If  a  member  of  his  family  was  going 
to  have  a  high-fallutin'  title — so  was  he.  So 
Jackie  begged  to  be  godfather  and  went  through 
all  the  church  ritual  without  a  slip.  What's 
more,  he  says  he  is  going  to  take  an  active  hand 
in  the  raising  of  little  Patricia.

room  Lily  took  one  look  and  gasped,  "  You  look 
ghastly  with  that  mustache." 

So  the  amazed  but  obliging  prince  proceeded 
tc  Lily's  bathroom,  found  a  razor,  and  promptly 
removed  the  offending  hirsute  adornment.  He 
walked  back  into  the  Damita  living  room  and 
Lily  took  another  look.  "Oh,"  she  wailed, 
"you  look  even  worse."  And  the  poor  prince 
left  to  ponder  on  the  ways  of  women. 


"V't  W  would  never  know  hot  tamale  Lupe 
Yt  ley..  Lordy,  Lordy  what  a  change.  She's 
as  quiet  as  a  one  man  conference.  Because  she 
hasn't  gone  out  much  since  her  return  to  Hol- 
lywood from  Xew  York  the  folks  haven't  had 
a  chance  to  see  all  the  new  things  she  brought 
back  with  her.    So  here's  a  list  of  them. 

A  new  diamond  bracelet. 

A  Bel  of  matched  rubies. 

A  chinchilla  coat. 

An  ermine  coat. 

A  half  dozen  ordinary  fur  coats. 

A  diamond  necklace. 

And  two  hundred  pairs  of  new  shoes! 

TTrXERE  is  a  man  in  Holly-wood  who  actually 
earns  a  good  living  by  shooting  people. 

Karl  Bunn,  in  a  machine  gun  battalion,  lost 
an  arm  and  a  leg  in  the  war.  but  learned  plenty 
about  crack  shooting  just  the  same,  so  came  to 
Hollywood  and  has  been  making  good  money 
since.  It's  Earl  Bunn  who  does  half  the  expert 
shooting  that's  done  in  movies. 

He  did  most  of  the  shooting  in  "Scarface," 
"What  Price  Glory"  and  "The  Big  Parade." 

In  "The  Bitter  Tea  of  General  Yen,"  Bunn 
etched  a  halo  of  shots  about  the  lovely  head  of 
Barbara  Stanwyck,  who  never  blinked  a  long 
eyelash. 

A  GROUP  of  children  in  a  Hollywood  school 
whispered  about  one  of  their  little  pals. 
Finally,  they  made  up  their  minds  to  tell  her. 
They  surrounded  Carolyn  Sammon. 

"  Did  anyone  ever  tell  you  that  you  look  like 
Peggy  Shannon?" 

"  I'm  glad  you  think  so." 

"Why  don't  you  send  her  your  picture.  Car- 
olyn? Maybe  she  will  send  you  one  of  hers  all 
signed  and  everything. " 

"  I  could  do  that,  of  course, "  answered  eight 
year  old  Carolyn,  "but,  you  see.  Peggy  Shan- 
non is  my  sister. " 

And  she  had  been  in  that  school  an  entire 
season  before  she  told  them !

Kotex 


SANITARY    NAPKIN 

(U.    S.    Pat.    No.  1,857,854) 

SOMETIMES  one  offends  unknowingly! 
Perhaps  unconsciously  you've  overlooked 
certain  things  no  fastidious  woman  should 
overlook.  Those  telltale  outlines  .  .  .  those 
revealing  wrinkles  . .  .  that  mar  the  outlines 
of  your  close-fitting  dresses. 

But  now  no  danger  of  offending  again. 
Kotex,  originator  of  the  modern  sanitary 
napkin,  presents  the  new  Phantom  Kotex. 
A  sanitary  pad  fashioned  to  fit  smoothly, 
invisibly,  even  under  the  filmiest  fabrics. 

Flattened,  tapered 

The  ends  of  this  new  Phantom  Kotex  are 
flattened,  and  skilfully  tapered.  They  leave 
absolutely  no  outline  .  .  .  not  the  slight- 
est bulk.  And  because  it  is  so  self-conceal- 
ing, you  are  almost  unaware  of  this  modern 
sanitary  protection.  It  molds  itself  to  the 
contours  of  the  body. 

In  efficiency,  softness,  safety,  the  new 
Phantom  Kotex  is  exactly  the  same  Kotex 
you  have  always  known.  Wonderfully  ab- 
sorbent; disposable,  of  course.  Hospitals 
alone  last  year  used  more  than  24  million 
Kotex  pads. 

Do  not  be  confused.  Other  sanitary  pads 
calling  themselves  form-fitting;  other  styles 
with  so-called  tapered  ends,  are  in  no  sense 
the  same  as  the  new  Phantom  Kotex,  U.  S. 
Patent  No.  1,857,854. 

And  doubly  important,  today — you  get 
this  new,  vastly  improved  product  at  no 
increase  in  price.  Kotex  prices  are  today 
the  lowest  in  Kotex  history. 

Be  sure  when  buying  it  wrapped  that 
you  do  get  genuine  Kotex.  For  your  pro- 
tection, each  tapered  end  is  plainly  marked 
"Kotex."  On  sale  at  drug,  dry  goods  and 
department  stores.  Also  in  vending  cab- 
inets through  the  West  Disinfecting  Co. 

Kotex  Company,  Chicago. 

Note!  Kotex — now  at  your  dealer's  —  marked 
"Form-Fitting"  is  the  new  Phantom*  Kotex. 


To 


o  ease 
the  task  of 
enlightenment 

This  message  is  sent  to 
parents  and  guardians 
in  a  spirit  of  con- 
structive helpfulness. 

THIS  year — some  five 
million  young  girls  be- 
tween the  ages  of  10  and  14 
will  face  one  of  the  most  try- 
ing situations  in  all  the  years 
of  young  womanhood. 

This  year — some  five  mil- 
lion mothers  will  face  the 
most  difficult  taskof  mother- 
hood. 

Thousands  of  these  moth- 
ers will  sit  down  in  quiet 
rooms — and  from  that  in- 
timacy so  characteristic  of 
today' s  mother  and  daughter 
■ — there  will  result  that  un- 
derstanding so  vital  to  the 
daughter  of  today — the  wife 
and  mother  of  tomorrow. 

There  will  be  other  thou- 
sands of  mothers — coura- 
geous— intimate  in  all  things 
but  this.  There  will  be  thou- 
sands too  timid  to  meet  this 
problem — and  it  will  pass- 
but  with  what  possible  un- 
happiness  .  .  .  what  heart- 
breaking experience. 

To  free  this  task  of  en- 
lightenment from  the  slight- 
est embarrassment  —  the 
Kotex  Company  has  had 
prepared  an  intimate  little 
chat  between  mother  and 
daughter.  It  is  called  "Mar-

A  LTHOUGH  Lupe  brought  back  a  lot  of 
new  jewelry  and  new  clothes  from  Xew 
York  she  has  not  redecorated  her  house,  and 
that  big  Chinese  rug  that  has  been  in  her  living 
room  for  four  years  is  still  there.  There's  a 
very  funny  story  al>out  the  rug. 

Four  years  ago  Lupe  had  a  business  manager 
and  she  promised  him  that  she  would  not  buy 
anything  without  his  permission. 

One  day,  she  telephoned  the  manager  from 
a  store  and  asked  him  to  come  down  right  away 
because  they  were  trying  to  charge  her  twenty 
dollars  for  a  small  bathroom  rug  and  she 
thought  it  was  too  much. 

The  manager  wns  just  that  pleased— Lupe 
was  learning  the  lessons  of  economy — imagine 
asking  his  permission  to  spend  twenty  dollars! 
Ah,  his  teaching  had  not  been  in  vain.  So  he 
rushed  right  doun  to  the  store  only  to  discover 
Lupe  giving  directions  lor  the  delivery  of  a 
(3,000  Chinese  rug  she  had  chanced  to  see  and 
had  bought  while  she  was  waiting  for  the  man- 
ager to  arrive! 

TJ'ERE'S  a  swell  story  that  every  Hollywood 
husband  should  read. 

Una  MerkePs  new  husband.  Ronald  Burla, 
an  aeronautical  engineer,  dislikes  the  publicity 
and  attention  that  follows  his  cute  little  movie 
wife. 

Recently  Mr.  Burla  and  Una  went  camping, 
pitching  their  tent  along  the  roadside  and 
roughing  it  like  good  fellows. 

One  morning  a  group  of  small  boys  gathered 
by  the  tent  and  began  staring  intently  at  the 
pair.  More  boys  joined  the  group  until  there 
«a>  .i  big  crowd  of  kids. 

"I  don't  like  this.''  Burla  grumbled.  "Xo 
privacy  at  all.     It  gets  my  goat.'' 

"Now,  honey,"  Una  drawled,  "we've  just 

88 


gotta  expect  this.  As  long  as  I'm  in  pictures, 
there  will  always  be  this  curiosity. " 

Finally  one  of  the  boys  could  stand  it  no 
longer.  He  approached  the  tent  shyly  and 
walking  up  to  Una,  said, 

'Lady,  excuse  us.  but  isn't  that  man  you're 
with  Ronald  Colman?'' 

And  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Burla  passed  right  out  of 
the  picture. 


Y\7IIF\"  Sally  Filers  began  her  career  one  of 
her  ambitions  was  to  be  able  to  buy  her 
mother  and  father  a  gorgeous  home  in  Beverly 
Hills.  Now  she  has  bought  the  home  and  it 
just  goes  to  show  what  happens  to  a  girl  when 
she  decides  that  come  good  or  come  bad 
breaks  she  won't  give  up. 

For  five  years  Sally  has  been  in — and  out — 
of  pictures  and  dozens  of  times  she  has  been 
tempted  to  yell,  "quits."  It's  no  secret  that 
her  husband,  Hoot  Gibson,  would  like  her 
to  remain  at  home.  But  Sally  has  stuck  it  out. 
And  look  where  she  is  now! 

"JUST  what  does  Ethel  Barrymore 
I  really  look  like?"  someone  asked 
an  M-G-M  worker.  "Ethel  Barry-

ing to  look  like  Ethel  Barrymore," 
was  the  answer.    Got  a  clear  picture? 

QLAUDETTE  COLBERT  is,  at  the  mo- 
ment, Hollywood's  happiest  young  woman 
for  she  has  a  role  that  she  thinks  is  different 
from  the  average  leading  lady  parts  she  has 
been  handed  for  the  last  year.  When  she  heard 
the  big  news  she  rushed  around  to  all  her  friends 
screaming,  "I'm  going  to  play  the  bad  girl  in 
'The  Sign  of  the  Cross.'  I'm  going  to  play  the 
bad  girl  in  'The  Sign  of  the  Cross'. " 

Incidentally  C.  B.  DeMille  has  brought  back 
a  bit  of  old  Hollywood  atmosphere  in  directing 
this  story  of  Christian  martyrdom — and  doesn't 
that  sound  exactly  like  C.  B.?  The  studio  is 
alive  with  Nubian  slaves,  ladies  with  trick  curls, 
big  actors  with  gold  bracelets  and — yes,  hon- 
estly— sunken  baths.  And  DeMille,  in  all  his 
splendor  of  puttees  and  megaphone  sits  high 
up  at  the  top  of  the  set  and  directs  it  all. 

That  sort  of  directorial  splendor  went  out 
when  talkies  came  in,  but  DeMille  is  such  a 
swell  showman  he  wouldn't  miss  a  chance  to 
give  the  town  something  to  talk  about.

Now  to  look  at  this  jolly  chap  you  would  think  that  he  never  had  a  mali- 
cious thought,  yet  when  he  wants  to  he  can  turn  on  villain  stuff  that  makes 
your  flesh  creep.  And  if  you  don't  believe  it,  see  Charles  Laughton  in 
"Devil  and  the  Deep."  Oh  boy!  Heralded  as  the  Emil  Jannings  of  the 
stage,  he  is  now  in  Hollywood.     His  next  will  be  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross" 


Y\ THEN  Fatty  Arbuckle  faced  the  cameras 
again  after  all  these  eleven  years,  he  broke 
down  and  cried  like  a  baby.  Poor  Fatty,  I 
wonder  how  many  know  what  his  banishment 
has  meant  to  him.  And  however  you  feel 
about  him,  you've  got  to  admit  that  he  took 
his  medicine,  without  ever  indulging  in  self 
Pity- 
He's  worked  at  anything  he  could  find  to 
do — and  jobs  haven't  been  plentiful.  He  has 
been  a  gag  man,  a  cafe  proprietor,  a  writer  and 
director  of  short  comedies.  When  he  directed 
he  used  the  name  William  Goodrich.  Recently 
he  took  a  vaudeville  tour  and  its  success  has 
given  him  the  chance  to  act  again.  For  eleven 
years  Fatty  has  taken  the  punishment  and  not 
broken.  He  broke  when  his  chance  came  again 
and  when,  once  more,  he  heard  the  purr  of  the 
cameras  and  knew  that  his  big  chance  had 
come — he  cried.  Hut  they  weren't  tears  of 
self  pity.    Fatty  was  weeping  for  joy! 

'"THERE'S  a  man  in  Los  Angeles  who  fore- 
tells  with  deadly  accuracy  the  chances  of 
every  new  arrival  for  stardom  in  pictures.  He 
is  neither  a  fortune  teller  nor  a  mystic.  He 
reads  no  card  and  gazes  into  no  crystal. 

His  name  is  Daddy  Lane  and  he  sells  news- 
papers at  the  Santa  Fe  depot  in  Los  Angeles. 
He  spots  the  newcomers  and  can  tell  instantly 
whether  they're  looking  toward  Hollywood  or 
just  on  a  visit. 

"It's  the  way  they  look  around  with  their 
eyes  shining,  that  tells  me  they're  here  for  a 


try  at  the  movies,"  says  Lane.  Daddy,  sixty- 
five  years  old,  began  checking  the  arrivals  he 
had  banked  on  to  see  the  result.  Opposite 
such  names  as  Norma  Shearer,  Miriam  Hop- 
kins, Elissa  Landi,  Joan  Blondell  and  Ann 
Dvorak  is  Daddy  Lane's  O.  K. 

There  was  one  that  puzzled  him.  She  had 
all  the  ear  marks  of  a  potential  star  but  de- 
clared she  hadn't  the  slightest  interest  in  mov- 
ies, which  was  quite  true  at  the  time.  "Well, 
if  you  ever  do,  "  he  said,  "you'll  be  a  star  sure.  " 
And  his  prediction  to  Jean  Harlow  has  cer- 
tainly come   true. 

But  his  biggest  winner  was  a  long,  lanky  girl 
who  stepped  off  the  train  with  no  one  to  care 
particularly  whether  she  arrived  or  not.  "She's 
a  winner,"  Daddy  said.  And  sure  enough  in 
that  famous  notebook  of  his  is  written  the  line: 

Greta  Garbo O.  K. 

"pOR  once,  at  least,  pictures  took  a  back  seat 
for  the  Olympic  games  in  Hollywood.  And 
movie  stars  did  a  grand  fade-out  for  the  win- 
ning athletes.  Merely  spectators,  and  thrilled 
to  be  so,  the  movie  stars  crowded  the  Olympic 
stadium  and  cheered  their  favorite  with  their 
best  microphone  voices.  In  fact,  Lew  Ayres 
became  so  excited  he  stood  up  to  shout.  "Down 
in  front,"  the  crowd  roared,  uninterested  in 
seeing  a  movie  star,  and  Lew,  grinning  sheep- 
ishly, sat  down.  Douglas  Fairbanks  never 
missed  an  event.  Gary  Cooper  and  Harold 
Lloyd  rooted  by  his  side  and  argued  over  points 
and  favorites. 


(^LARK  GABLE,  Bob  Montgomery  and 
^"^other  polo  players  actually  sneaked  away 
from  the  studios  in  makeup  to  watch  the  eques- 
trian events  like  little  wide-eyed  kids. 

Johnny  Weissmuller  simply  lived  at  the 
swimming  stadium,  while  Bebe  Daniels  yelled 
for  her  favorite  at  the  fencing  matches.  And 
the  debonair  William  Powell  became  so  excited 
over  the  800  meter  dash,  he  almost  fell  off  the 
grandstand  while  his  wife,  Carole  Lombard, 
was  so  intent  on  the  Finnish  javeline  thrower, 
she  never  noticed  Willie  tumbling. 

Strange,  indeed,  was  the  sight  of  world  fam- 
ous stars,  asking  the  Olympic  winners  for  auto- 
graphs. 

All  of  which  proves  Hollywood  isn't  so  self 
centered  and  all  in  all,  as  we  imagined.

IORETTA  YOUNG  wears 
I — her  golden-brown  hair 
soft  and  full  at  the  back  be- 
cause she  thinks  her  neck  is 
long  and  this  effect  mini- 
mizes its  length.  These  new, 
wide  shoulders  and  necklines 
are  very  flattering  to  her  type 


HOLLYWOOD  has  an  important  beauty- 
glamour  secret  from  which  we  might  all 
take  a  helpful  lesson.  That  is,  its  way 
of  emphasizing  certain  features  for  effect — not 
for  mere  beauty,  mind  you.  Take  the  face  of 
your  favorite  star.  Examine  it  carefully.  See 
if  you  can  detect  just  that  certain  something 
that  makes  her  face  distinct,  memorable  even. 
above  the  thousands  of  pretty  faces  about  us. 
The  Dietrich  eyebrows  for  example.  The 
Crawford  mouth,  which  you  may  not  like  but 
which  you  certainly  cannot  forget.  Garbo's 
hair,  plain  to  the  point  of  primness,  drawn 
back,  but  revealing  every  shade  of  feeling  in 
that  star's  face. 

There  is  in  jour  own  face  a  feature,  an 
effect,  which  you  might  accent  with  pleasing 
pointedness.  Look  at  yourself  critically. 
Perhaps  you  have  unusual  brows.  They  may 
not  be  thin  and  arched  like  Tallulah  Hank- 
head's.  They  may  grow  in  that  amusing  way- 
ward manner  of  Elissa  Landi's.  Hut  they  may 
frame  your  eyes  perfectly  and  not  look  like 
any  other  brows  you  know.  Then  leave  them 
alone.  Don't  go  bobbing  and  plucking  here 
and   there  to  make  them  look  like  another's. 

Or  your  mouth.  It  may  be  large,  irregular, 
but  animated,  vivacious.  Then  don't  curb 
it  with  a  'lipstick,  trying  to  make  it  smaller 
and  less  mobile. 

And  so  on  with  every  part  of  your  face,  from 
your  chin  to  your  ears.  Pick  out  what  is 
good,  try  to  throw  it  into  prominence,  whether 
it  makes  for  mere  beauty  or  not.  and  forget 
><>iir  little  deficiencies  by  letting  them  alone. 

In  this  way  you  can  wake  up  latent  loveli- 
Dl  — .  find,  perhaps,  a  face  you  never  knew  you 
had.  And  it  is  amazing  how  this  kind'  of 
good  looks  impresses,  lasts  and  pleases. 
Hollywood  knows.

•^nice  crop  of  lashes  are 
aided  by  nightly  applications 
of  olive  oil.  Good  for  brows, 
too.  A  small  brush  is  handier

tion. Brush  top  lashes  up- 
ward,  bottom    downward 


JEAN  HARLOW  uses  platinum  polish  on  her 
nails  to  match  her  platinum  hair.  We 
brunettes  and  semi-blondes  can't  quite 
match  ourselves  up  like  that,  but  I  suppose 
you  all  know  of  the  delightful  vagaries  in 
liquid  polish,  emerald,  sapphire,  amethyst,  all 
the  jewel  tones.  Charming  accents  when 
worn  with  the  right  evening  gown,  but  be  sure 
to  remove  this  gay  conceit  before  you  go  about 
your  daily  affairs.  There  it  would  be  awful. 
A  platinum  tip  on  a  rose  nail  is  a  flattering 
touch  to  any  hand. 

T  OXG  before  I  met  Una  Merkel  I  heard  this 
-'-'kind  of  comment  about  her,  '"Grand  girL 
Grand  disposition,"  etc.  Well,  not  long  ago 
I  met  Una,  very  rushed  for  time  between 
personal  appearances  at  the  Capitol  Theater, 
but  perfectly  willing  to  get  up  early  and  pose 
for  those  pictures  you  see  in  other  pages  of  this 
department,  patient,  smiling  and  willing  to  try 
this  pose.  that.  And  so  I  thought,  that  is  what 
a  good  disposition  does  for  a  girl.  People  talk 
about  it.  like  it.  She  develops  a  reputation  in 
this  respect.  So  when  you  see  Una  on  the 
screen  it  is  like  greeting  a  pleasant  friend,  in 
addition  to  being  entertained.  A  good  disposi- 
tion is  something  to  take  seriously  if  you  want 
true,  lasting  popularity. 

BF.TTE  DAYIS'  brows  and  lashes  are  black 
and  her  hair  naturally  ash  blonde.  Hut 
she  bleaches  it  for  the  camera  to  a  nice  corn 
color.  It  is  shampooed  weekly  and  receives 
generous  treatments  with  olive  oil  to  keep  it  in 
good  condition.  Her  eyes  are  among  the 
bluest  I  have  ever  seen,  truly  violet.  Bette 
keeps  appointments  to  the  minute,  which 
ought  to  send  her  to  the  head  of  her  class  any 
time.

J  .  Start  powdering  at  the  lower  cheeks.  Gently  pat 
and  blend  powder  toward  center  of  the  face.  Powder 
the  nose  last;  otherwise  the  nose  -will  be  0-vcr-pow- 
dercd,  making  it  appear  more  prominent.  Use  correct 
color  harmony  shade  in  Max  Factor's  face  powder.

STEP  forward,  Tom  Brown.    The  boys  and 
girls   have   just    filled    the   mail   bag   this 
month,  asking  questions  about  you.    And 
I'm  going  to  tell  all. 

loin  was  born  in  New  York  City,  on  Janu- 
ary 6,  1913,  and  in  private  life  answers  to  the 
name  of  Thomas  Edward  Brown.  He  is  5  feet. 
10  inches  tall;  weighs  150  pounds  and  has 
brown  hair  and  blue  eyes.  Attended  Profes- 
sional Children's  School  in  New  York.  His 
father  and  mother  were  both  on  the  stage  so  it 
is  not  surprising  that  Tom  made  his  stage 
debut  at  an  age  when  little  boys  wear  dresses. 
Among  the  plays  he  appeared  in  are  "Is  Zat 
So?"  ".Many  a  Slip,"  "Neighbors,"  and  "In 
This  Room." 

As  a  child  actor  Tom  appeared  in  silent 
pictures,  namely.  "The  Wrong  Doers,"  "The 
Hoosier  School  Master,"  and  "That  Old  Gang 
of  Mine."  His  first  talkie  was  "The  Lady 
Lies"  with  Claudette  Colbert.  Since  then  he 
has  been  in  "Queen  High,"  "The  Famous  Fer- 
guson Case."  "Fast  Companions,"  and  "Tom 
Brown  of  Culver."  His  latest  is  "Hell's  High- 
way." 

Tom's  greatest  ambition  is  to  be  a  director. 
He  says  they  last  longer  in  pictures  than  actors 
do. 

Harry  Brow  nixo.  Florida. — Marie  Dress- 
ler's  picture  "Prosperity"  has  been  held  up  for 
retakes,  so  you  won't  see  it  for  a  while  yet. 
That's  what  I  calls  "Depression"  not  "Pros- 
perity,"  when  they  make  us  wait  so  long  for  a 
Dressier  knock-out. 

R.  M.,  BUFFALO,  X.  Y. — It  is  true  that  the 
gorgeous  Garbo  has  returned  to  Sweden.  And 
has  she  come  out  of  her  shell!  Why,  she  talks 
to  everyone,  at  least  four  or  live  people.  She 
even  posed  for  a  couple  of  news  pictures. 

Joan-  Blexcowe,  Buenos  Aires. — You 
ought  to  make  a  good  aviator,  Joan,  because 
you  are  interested  in  altitude  records.  Well, 
here  they  are.  Lionel  Barrymore  soars  to  6 
feet.  4  inches;  Adolphe  Menjou,  5  feet,  lO'j; 
Charlotte  Greenwood,  5  feet,  9;  Greta  Garbo, 
5  feet,  6;  Marlene  Dietrich  and  Kay  Francis, 
each  5  fed.  5;  and  Lilian  Harvey,  new  Euro- 
pean discovery,  is  just  5  feet  tall. 

Tootsie  of  Uxiox  City,  X.  J. — Gary 
Cooper's  monk  answers  to  the  name  of  Toluca. 
It  is  treated  like  one  of  the  family.  Even  has 
its  clothes  made  to  order.  I  don't  believe  that 
Gary  has  learned  to  play  the  hand-organ  yet. 
Not  a  bad  idea,  though.  With  all  the  big 
salary  cuts  who  knows  but  that  Toluca  may 
have  to  help  earn  he.-  daily  bread  some  day. 

Alice  Salmon,  Milwaukee,  Wis.— Alice, 
your  assignment  is  quite  simple.  The  picture, 
"Hell's  Heroes,"  was  taken  from  Peter  B. 
Kync's  story  "The  Three  Godfathers."  Xow 
that  that's  straightened  out,  your  bookseller 
won't  have  any  trouble  getting  the  book  for 
you.  If  "The  Three  Godfathers"  were  "Hell's 
Heroes"  what  would  they  call  some  mothers- 
in-law:1  See,  I  can  ask  questions  as  well  as 
answer  them.

This  lad,  Tom  Brown,  has  won 
two  distinctions.  First,  they 
named  a  picture  after  him — 
"Tom  Brown  of  Culver."  And 
then  he  did  such  fine  work  in  it 
that  he  topped  the  month's  list  of 
favorites     in     this    department 


Mary  Lor,  Brooklyn,  N.  Y. — Yes,  it's  too 
bad  that  the  Xatalie  Talmadge-Buster  Keaton 
divorce  had  to  come.  And  after  ten  years  of 
married  life.  Xatalie  was  given  the  custody  of 
the  two  boys.  The  kids  were  taught  plenty  of 
tricks  by  their  famous  dad,  which  they  may  be 
able  to  use  if  they  ever  decide  to  follow  his 
profession. 

Clara  Bow  Fax,  Detroit,  Mich. — Clara 
has  taken  off  many  pounds  and  is  her  old 
buoyant  self  again.  Look  at  that  grand  picture 
of  her  in  the  gallery  this  month.  "Call  Her 
Savage"  will  mark  her  return  to  the  talkies. 
Remember  way  back  when  Clara  was  almost 
called  that,  when  she  was  reported  engaged  to 
Bob  Savage? 

Patsy,  Omaha,  Xebr. — Xow  I  ask  you, 
Patsy,  why  should  I  rave  over  a  mere  man? 
It  would  be  different  if  you  asked  my  opinion 
of  some  fair  damsel.  Anyway,  Georgie  Raft 
hails  from  the  toughest  part  of  Xew  York  City, 
known  as  "Hell's  Kitchen."  Wouldn't  that  be 
an  appetizing  title  for  a  movie?  George  will 
be  2')  years  old  on  September  26.  He  is  5  feet. 
11  inches  tall;  weighs  160  and  has  black  hair 
and  brown  eyes. 

Mari  Arpex,  Pawtvcket,  R.  I. — Tom 
Douglas  was  the  chap  who  played  the  role  of 
Edward  Smith  in  "Sky  Bride."  If  Tom  were 
to  marry  all  the  girls  who  are  just  crazy  about 
him,  he'd  have  quite  a  harem.  But  Tom  hails 
from  Louisville,  Kentucky,  not  Turkey,  and 
therefore  to  save  many  hearts  from  being 
broken,  he's  still  a  bachelor.  How  long  will 
that  last2  Tom  is  5  feet,  101  ■_>  inches  tall; 
weighs  140  and  has  blond  hair  and  brown  eyes, 
He  will  be  26  years  old  on  the  fourth  of  Sep- 
tember.

Bloxdie,  Sax  Francisco,  Cal. — With  all 
the  bachelors  in  Hollywood,  why  fall  for  a 
married  man  like  Stuart  Erwin?  I  agree  with 
you  that  Stu's  a  grand  comedian.  Everything 
he  does  is  funny.  Why,  he  was  even  born  in  a 
place  called  Squaw  Valley,  and  on  Yalentine's 
Day,  too.  In  case  you  never  heard  of  Squaw- 
Valley,  it's  located  about  fifty  miles  from 
Fresno,  Calif. 

Mary  Wardell,  Kansas  City,  Mo. — I 
thank  you  for  your  interest  in  me,  but  I  never 
send  out  autographed  photos  of  myself.  He- 
sides,  my  long  gray  beard  hides  too  much  of  my 
handsome  face.  However,  you  can  get  a  photo 
of  Miriam  Hopkins  by  writing  to  her  at  the 
Paramount  Studios,  Hollywood,  Calif.,  and 
enclosing  25  cents.  Look  elsewhere  in  this 
issue  and  you  will  find  a  complete  list  of  stars 
and  their  addresses. 

Helen  Madden. — Was  I  skeered  and  did  I 
keep  the  lights  burning  all  night  after  seeing 
"Dracula"!  Your  memory  is  correct.  It  was 
Helen  Chandler  who  was  persecuted  by  that 
awful  Count.  The  name  of  the  little  ditty-  is, 
"What  a  Little  Thing  Like  a  Wedding  Ring  Can 
Do."  Believe  me,  it  keeps  many  a  chap  home 
lights  when  otherwise  he  would  be  out  singing 
"Sweet  Ad-dul-line." 

Bob  amd  Babs,  Everett,  Mass. — Yes, 
children,  George  Brent  did  play  the  part  of 
Allen  Scott  in  "The  Lightning  Warrior"  with 
Rin-Tin-Tin.  Weren't  you  sorry  when  you 
heard  that  poor  Rinty  died?  He  left  a  two- 
year-old  son  to  take  his  place  and  carry  on  his 
name. 

Virginia  Rustax,  Wilkes-Barre,  Pexna .— 
There  are  a  lot  of  other  girls,  too.  who  are  writ- 
ing in  asking  about  Charles  Boyer.  Well, 
here's  the  low-down  for  all  you  Boyer  fans. 
Charles  was  born  in  Figeac,  France,  on  August 
28.  (He  forgot  to  mention  the  year.)  He  is 
5  feet,  11  inches  tall;  weighs  154  pounds  and 
has  black  hair  and  brown  eyes.  Is  very  well 
known  on  the  French  stage.  In  1929  he  made 
his  screen  debut  in  Berlin.  Metro-Goldwyn- 
Mayer  brought  him  over  here  to  do  French 
versions.  He  appeared  in  the  French  version 
of  "The  Big  House"  and  "The  Trial  of  Mary 
Dugan."  His  contract  with  M-G-M  calls  for 
pictures  during  six  months  of  the  year,  leaving 
him  the  other  six  months  to  return  to  the 
French  stage.  Has  written  many  published 
short  stories  and  has  a  large  collection  of 
French  first  editions.  He  plays  tennis  and  is 
an  excellent  violinist.  Paramount  borrowed 
him  for  the  lead  in  "The  Man  From  Yester- 
day." 

Tootsie  Anderson-,  Melissa.  Tex.— 
Tommy  Conlon  was  born  in  Philadelphia, 
Penna.,  just  fifteen  years  ago,  June  21,  to  be 
exact.  He  is  5  feet.  I1  j  inches  tall;  weighs  100 
pounds  and  has  auburn  brown  hair  and  blue 
eyes.  Lots  of  girls  think  Tommy's  just  grand, 
but  thus  far  he  has  managed  to  stay  single. 
Have  you  seen  him  in  "Rebecca  of  Sunnybrook 
Farm"?

Edna  Ann  Crowe,  Philadelphia,  Penna. — 
Here  are  the  vital  statistics  about  Marlene 
Dietrich  that  you  want.  She  was  born  De- 
cember 27,  1904.  Get  busy  with  your  pencil 
and  paper  and  figure  it  out.  She  is  5  feet,  5 
inches  tall,  and  weighs  about  120  pounds. 

W.  A.  Saxdahl,  Charitox,  Iowa. — Sorry 
to  disappoint  you,  but  it's  quite  true  that  Janet 
Gaynor  did  not  do  "Rebecca  of  Sunnybrook 
Farm"  after  all.  Little  Marian  Nixon  got  the 
break.  Janet,  you  know,  is  trying  to  get  away 
from  those  ultra-sweet  roles.  But  Old  Man 
Public  just  won't  let  her. 

Margaret  Elizabeth  Green,  Charlotte, 
X.  C. — T  thought  everybody  knew  everything 
there  was  to  know  about  Garbo — and  a  lot 
that  there  isn't  to  know.  At  any  rate,  she  is 
5  feet,  6  inches  tall. 

Isabel  Fraxcia,  Toxdo,  Manila. — 
Wouldn't  you  have  been  excited  if  Mary  Astor 
had  gone  on  to  Manila  when  she  was  cruising 
around  the  South  Seas  on  her  yacht?  Her 
baby  was  born  in  Hawaii,  you  know.  Mary 
is  a  middle-Western  girl;  Quincy,  111.,  is  her 
birthplace.  The  last  picture  she  made  before  the 
baby  was  born  was  "A  Successful  Calamity." 

Nell  Tate,  Rutherfordton,  N.  C. — If  all 
the  wagers  I've  settled  were  laid  end  to  end 
they  would  three  times  encircle  Hollywood. 
Well,  Nell',  I'll  settle  your  wager  for  you  Mary 
Pickford  was  born  April  8,  1893.    Who  wins? 

K.  L.  Holloway,  Bordextown,  N.  J. — If 
May  Robson  could  see  your  letter  I  know  she'd 
take  a  big  bow.  I  agree  with  you.  She  was 
great  in  "Letty  Lynton.-'  And  if  you  liked 
her  in  that,  wait  until  you  see  her  in  ''Strange 
Interlude.  "  After  playing  those  two  intensely 
dramatic  parts,  you'll  find  her  doing  a  comedy 
role  in  "Red-Headed  Woman. "  Picture  fans 
have  just  discovered  her,  but  she  has  been 
known  and  loved  on  the  stage  for  forty-seven 
years.  However,  it  looks  as  if  she  is  a  perma- 
nent fixture  in  Hollywood,  now.

"Her  great-great-grandmother's? 
How'd  she  dare  wash  it?" 


IVORY  SNOW,  silly! 
That's  as  gentle  as  the 
soap  you  use  on  your  face.' 


KS-^m 


No  soap  spots  to  strain  cobwebby  threads 
—with  IVORY  SNOW.  Fine,  sheer  fabrics 
need  delicate  handling.  If  a  flake  of  soap  flat- 
tens into  the  mesh,  it  takes  rubbing  to  rinse  it 
out  and  if  it  dries  in,  it  makes  a  stiff,  brittle  spot 
where  the  threads  break  easily.  That  is  why 
Ivory  Snow  is  so  safe  for  washing  precious  laces, 
trousseau  lingerie,  fine  woolens,  sheer  silk  stock- 
ings. Ivory  Snow  has  no  flat  particles  that  can 
cling  and  make  soap  spots!  Instead  of  being  cut 
into  flat  flakes,  it  is  BLOWN.  Each  particle  is 
soft  and  round,  so  that  it  melts  even  in  lukewarm 
water  like  snow  itself. 

Instant  suds  without  using   hot  water. 

No  danger  of  plunging  your  fine  things  by  mis- 
take into  too-hot  suds  when  you  use  Ivory  Snow! 
For  with  Ivory  Snow  you  can  start  with  safe, 
LUKEWARM  water.  In  an  instant  you'll  get 
thoroughly  dissolved  suds  that  won't  redden  your 
hands  .  .  .  that  will  be  gentle  to  fabrics  and  col- 
ors .  .  .  that  will  rinse  quickly  and  clearly  away. 

PURE  as  the  babies'  bath  soap.  Ivory 
Snow  is  pure  Ivory  Soap.  Where  can  you  find  as 
safe  a  soap  for  costly  fineries  as  Ivory,  which  doc- 
tors advise  for  a  baby's  tender  skin?  Be  econom- 
ical. Get  Ivory  Snow  from  your  grocer  and  take

"OT  tamalcs  and  frijoles 
may  be  your  idea  of 
Mexican  cookery,  but 

"afteradinncrat  Dolores 
Del  Rio's  you  will  find  that 
Mexico  needs  a  whole  new  sec- 
tion in  the  cook  book! 

Dolores  doesn't  pose  in  an 
apron  just  to  make  a  pretty 
domestic  picture,  she  actually 
can  whip  up  some  very  tasty 
dishes  when  urged.  There's  a 
rice  dish  which  is  one  of  her  best. 
It  may  have  a  long  Latin  name 
but  for  convenience  it  shall  be 
called  Mexican  rice  —  and  here's 
how  you  go  about  making  it. 

Mexican  Rice.  —  The  ingredi- 
ents for  this  dish  include  2  cups 
of  cooked  brown  rice.  J<£  cup  of 
melted  butter,  3  tablespoons 
chopped  green  peppers,  1  small 
onion  chopped,  J^  cup  stewed 
raisins,  2  tablespoons  tomato 
ketchup,  a  dash  of  cayenne  or 
tabasco,  as  you  wish,  and  1  tea- 
spoon of  salt.  All  of  these  are 
mixed  together,  put  into  a  bak- 
ing dish  and  covered  with  grated 
cheese. 

Dolores  uses  brown  rice  for 
this  dish;  however,  if  brown  rice 
is  not  available,  ordinary  white 
rice  will  work  out  just  as  well. 

Another  Del  Rio  favorite  is  a 
hot    sandwich — it    has    aU    the 
Mexican  zip  and  is  a  grand  sug- 
gestion for  your  late  evening  supper  parties  or  for  a  special 
luncheon  delicacy. 

Hot  Mexican  Sandwich. — Here's  what  you  will  need:  2 
tablespoons  of  chopped  onions,  2  tablespoons  of  melted  butter, 
3  cups  of  canned  tomatoes,  1  chopped  green  pepper,  J  ■>  cup  of 
chopped  celery,  1  tablespoon  of  flour,  }  ■>  pound  of  sliced  bacon, 
10  slices  of  bread,  thin  slices  of  American  cheese,  salt  and 
pepper. 

You  saute  your  chopped  onion  in  about  one  tablespoon  of  the 
butter  for  a  few  minutes,  then  add  the  tomatoes,  green  pepper 
and  celery.  Let  this  mixture  simmer  uncovered  for  a  half  hour. 
Blend  your  remaining  butter  with  the  flour  and  add  to  the 
sauce  with  the  salt  and  pepper  to  taste.  Stir  this  until  it 
thickens  slightly.  Fry  the  bacon  until  it  is  crisp.  Toast  the 
bread  on  both  sides.  Then  make  sandwiches  of  the  bread  and 
bacon,  laying  thin  slices  of  the  cheese  on  top.  Put  these  sand- 
wiches on  hot  plates  and  just 
before  serving,  pour  the  hot 
sauce  over  it  all. 

You  can't  imagine  how  deli- 
cious this  is  until  you  try  it ! 

Speaking  of  sandwiches,  Fred- 
ric  March  is  a  connoisseur  in 
that  line.  lie  likes  them  for 
luncheon  particularly-,  or  for  a 
late  snack  before  retiring  at 
night.  After  eating  several  of 
the  March  sandwich  specialties. 
we  begged  Frcdric  to  break  down 
and  tell  you  how  to  make  them. 
1  [ere  are  the  results!

jures up  some  of  those   old   family    recipes

cup  of  shrimps  as  a  starter. 
Then  add  another  half  cup  of 
cooked  chicken  livers,  the  same 
amount  of  red  peppers,  ditto  of 
Bermuda  onions,  salt  and  may- 
onnaise dressing. 

Mix  and  force  through  a  meat 
chopper  the  shrimps,  chicken 
livers  and  peppers  from  which 
the  seeds  have  been  removed, 
also  the  onion.  Season  all  this 
with  salt  and  moisten  with  the 
dressing.  Spread  between  thin 
slices  of  buttered  bread. 

Penobscot  Sandwich. — Here's  a 
sandwich  with  glamour!  Start 
out  with  one-half  of  a  cup  of 
cold,  boned  and  cooked  salmon. 
Mash  the  salmon,  adding  the 
white  of  one  hard-boiled  egg 
which  has  been  chopped  and  one 
tablespoon  of  finely  chopped 
cucumber  pickle.  Season  this 
mixture  with  salt  and  paprika — 
moisten  with  cream  salad  dress 
ing.  Next,  mash  the  yolks  of 
two  hard-boiled  eggs,  adding  one 
and  one-half  tablespoons  of 
melted  butter,  one  and  one-half 
tablespoons  of  chopped  nut 
meats  and  a  few  drops  of 
anchovy  essence. 

This  done,  remove  crusts  from 
a  stale  loaf  of  white  bread,  then 
cut  the  loaf  lengthwise  in  five 
slices.  Spread  three  slices,  on 
both  sides,  with  butter  worked 
until  creamy.  Spread  the  remaining  two  slices  on  but  one 
side.  Spread  the  two  mixtures  alternately  between  the  slices 
of  bread,  sprinkling  the  egg  yolk  mixture  with  the  finely 
chopped  green  pepper.  In  serving  this  sandwich,  you  cut  the 
loaf  crosswise  in  thin  slices,  each  piece  looks  almost  like  layer 
cake.  This  sandwich  is  a  perfect  suggestion  for  your  afternoon 
bridge  menus. 

Mrs.  March  contributed  her  husband's  favorite  salad  recipe 
to  the  general  conversation.  It  is  composed  entirely  of  mixed 
greens — this,  incidently,  is  the  classic  salad  of  the  French  race 
who  are  supposed  to  be  the  best  salad  mixers  in  the  world.  Green 
tops,  string  beans,  peas,  lettuce,  endive  and  watercress  go  into 
the  March's  best  salad  bowl.  The  whole  is  marinated  in 
French  dressing,  placed  in  the  ice  box,  and  served  an  hour 
later. 

Liver  Loaf  is  the  favorite  dish  of  charming  Adrienne  Ames. 

It  is  an  excellent,  healthful  one 
to  add  to  your  list  of  recipes, 
too.  It  takes  two  pounds  of 
calves'  liver.  Scald  the  liver  well 
and  put  through  the  grinder, 
using  a  medium  knife.  To  this 
add  two  cups  of  Zwiebach 
crumbs,  one  white  onion,  salt 
and  pepper  to  taste.  Mix  the 
whole  together  with  one  well- 
beaten  egg  and  one-quarter  of  a 
cup  of  milk.  Butter  a  bread  pan, 
fill  it  with  the  liver,  placing 
strips  of  bacon  on  top. 

Bake  this  for  about  an  hour 
in  a  300  degree  to  500  degree 
oven. 

Before  serving,  turn  out  onto 
a  platter  and  slice.

THE  NIGHT  MAYOR— Columbia 

A  GRAND  satire  about  a  frivolous  but  hon- 
est young  mayor  with  his  problems, 
feminine  and  political,  brought  to  the  screen 
in  an  amusing,  snappy  fashion.  Lee  Tracy,  as 
the  mayor,  falls  for  a  chorus  girl  (Evulyn 
Knapp)  and  gets  himself  in  a  complicated 
mix-up.  Tracy  is  priceless  as  the  dapper 
fashion  plate  and  the  supporting  cast  is  swell. 
The  story  is  more  than  timely.     See  it. 

THE  CABIN  IN  THE  COTTON— 
First  National 

ryCK  BARTHELMESS  comes  through 
-*-^with  one  of  his  best  performances  in  a 
beautifully  told  story  of  simple  folk  of  the  old 
S  •  th — their  trials,  their  poverty  and  their 
>reaks.  Dick  plays  one  of  the  poor 
white  trash.  Bette  Davis  fairly  scintillates  as 
the  rich  planter's  daughter,  while  Dorothy 
Jordan  is  splendid  as  the  poor  girl.  It's  Dick's 
picture,  however.  Scenery  gorgeous  and  cast 
excellent. 

70,000  WITNESSES— 
Paramount-Charles  R.  Rogers 

A  FOOTBALL  picture  that  ends  in  a 
■*  *■  murder  mystery.  It's  that  new.  Within 
sight  of  70,000  witnesses,  Johnny  Mack  Brown, 
the  victim,  races  for  the  goal  line  and  falls. 
Phillips  Holmes,  his  room-mate,  is  accused. 
So,  play  by  play,  the  game  is  re-enacted  and 
the  villain  trapped.  Suspense,  action  and 
thrills  are  packed  into  the  picture  with 
Charlie  Ruggles  a  riot  as  the  woozy  reporter. 
Dorothy  Jordan  is  the  heart  interest. 

TWO  AGAINST  THE  WORLD— 

Warners 

/CONSTANCE  BENNETT  looks  lovely  in 
^*this  picture  and  does  good  work  as  a  gay 
butterfly  made  to  face  reality.  The  story  is 
pretty  weak,  but  Connie  and  Neil  Hamilton 
do  their  best  to  make  it  seem  believable  in 
spite  of  itself.  And  in  what  lovely  clothes  /./ 
Bennett  is  decked.  Young  Allen  Vincent, 
v.  ho  plays  the  brother,  has  a  face  that  takes 
kindly   to   the  camera. 

THIRTEEN  WOMEN— RKO-Radio 

"\4"ENTAL  suggestion  causing  fantastic  re- 
■*-*-*-sults  is  the  brand-new  theme  of  this 
picture.  A  Hindu  woman,  played  magnifi- 
cently by  Myrna  Loy,  attempts  to  destroy 
thirteen  sorority  girls  who  were  her  enemies 
at  school.  Disconnected  scenes  are  a  bit  con- 
fusing at  first,  but  there  is  a  strong  cast,  headed 
by  Irene  Dunne  and  Ricardo  Cortez.  Enter- 
taining and  gripping  once  you  get  into  it, 
but  it  leaves  you  depressed. 

HOLLYWOOD  SPEAKS— Columbia 

T\  7ITH  all  the  good,  true-to-life  pictures  that 
W  have  been  made  about  Hollywood,  it's 
too  bad  that  this  one  should  come  along.  If 
you  must  see  some  more  movie  sets  and  more 
films  in  the  making,  you  might  like  this.  But 
it  isn't  Hollywood  and  don't  let  anybody  tell

TO  tell  the  truth,  Ann  is  33 — but  some- 
times she  feels  "not  a  day  over  80"! 
What's  the  matter? 

Why  is  she  just  as  tired  at  8  A.  M.  as  at 
midnight?  Where's  her  freshness  of  spirit? 
Why  is  her  skin  so  sallow  and  blotchy? 
What's  wrong? 

Perhaps  you  have  a  lot  in  common  with 
Ann.  Perhaps  you,  too,  are  overlooking  a 
primary  law  of  health  and  beauty.  She 
neglects  to  keep  clean  internally.  Do  you?  She 
needs  the  saline  treatment — with  Sal 
Hepatica.  Do  you? 

Unless  the  digestive  tract 
regularly  eliminates  its 
wastes,  these  ferment,  and 
send  poisons  through  the 
blood  stream. 

An  ordinary  laxative  isn't 


what  is  needed,  but  a  finely  blended  saline 
like  Sal  Hepatica.  For  Sal  Hepatica  not 
only  flushes  the  poisons  and  wastes  from 
the  digestive  tract,  but  it  also  cleanses  the 
blood  stream.  It  freshens  the  whole  sys- 
tem. It  counteracts  acidity. 

Sal  Hepatica  gets  at  the  causes  of  head- 
ache, colds,  indigestion,  rheumatism.  It 
tones  you  up  to  new  vitality. 

Trust  the  lovely  Continental  to  keep 
brilliantly  good-looking  and  fresh!  She 
goes  for  a  holiday  at  Carlsbad  or  Aix — 
and  drinks  the  saline  waters.  Sal 
Hepatica  offers  the  same  saline 
benefits.  One  week  with  the  fa- 
mous Sal  Hepatica  saline  treat- 
ments— at  home — and  you'll  feel 
as  if  you  had  been  to  a  European 
spa!  Try  it — beginning  today!

Luxor,  Ltd. 


His  first  step  toward  a  new  independence, 
when  he  returned  from  abroad,  was  to  take  a 
house  by  himself.  Bachelor's  quarters!  To 
live  alone,  to  order  his  own  life,  to  decide  things 
for  himself.  One  can  only  guess  a  little  of  what 
that  means  to  Gary.  Xot  that  he  cares  for  his 
family  less — I  think  that  he  will  love  them  more 
wisely  and  more  tolerantly  if  he  lives  apart 
from  them. 

T  LUNCHED  with  him  in  "the  dump,"  as  he 
*■  calls  it.  a  few  days  after  he  moved  in. 

'Tt's  not  very  big,  'he  said,  as  I  followed 
him  obediently  on  an  enthusiastic  tour  of  in- 
spection, "but  it's  mine.  It's  what  I  want. 
Nobody  decides  what  to  do  about  things  in  it 
but  me."  He  was  as  smug  about  it  as  a  small 
boy  who  has  been  given  a  shack  on  the  vacant 
lot  next  door  for  his  very  own.  He  was  full  of 
plans  for  the  disposition  of  his  trophies  from 
his  African  trip.  Heads,  skins,  antlers  and 
what-not  to  bedeck  walls  and  couches  and  fire- 
places. "Maybe  it  will  look  like  a  museum. 
But  I  want  them.  ' 

That  was  the  first  thing.  Then  thrie  was 
that  little  tilt  with  the  studio  over  his  part  in 
the  first  picture  he  made  upon  his  return.  He 
1  considered  the  part  an  unsympathetic  one. 
And  he  astounded  Paramount  executives  by- 
walking  into  their  offices  and  saying  so!  Gary! 
The  dawdling,  good-tempered  Gaiy,  speaking 
his  mind! 

Well!  He  didn't  get  upset  over  the  thing. 
1  ie  didn't  tear  his  hair  or  beat  his  breast  or  in- 
dulge in  a  commonplace,  "temperamental'' 
outburst.  He  stated  his  case,  reasonably,  and 
indicated  his  firm  intention  of  taking  a  stand 
and  staying  put. 

He  says  he  hasn't  had  any  trouble  since. 
'  It's  amazing  how  easy  it  is.  once  you  learn 
to  discover  what  you  want  and  then  go  after 
it.  Once  you  convince  people  that  you  aren't 
just  a  puppet  or  an  unreasonable  child.  They 
want  to  be  fair  and  they  will  listen  to  reason — 
if  you  give  it  to  them.  Things  are  swell — 
now!''  He  loves  his  role  in  "A  Farewell  to 
Arms."  He  loves  working  with  Helen  Hayes, 
whom  he  admires  intensely,  both  as  an  actress 
and  as  a  person.  He  admires  Frank  Borzage. 
who  is  directing  the  piece  to  Gary's  complete 
satisfaction. 

"The  thing  works  out  in  the  same  way  in 
your  life,''  he  told  me.     "You  have  to  know 


what  you  want  and  then  you  have  to  be  smart 
enough  not  to  want  it  too  much!  That's  what 
licks  you.  You  have  to  hold  hack  something  of 
yourself — a  little  part  of  your  ego  or  whatever 
you  call  it.  You  mustn't  give  everything  in 
any  human  relationship.  Especially  in  love. 
The  person  who  falls  in  love — (///  the  way — is 
bound  to  lose.  He  loses  control  of  himself  and 
of  the  whole  situation.  He  ceases  to  be  a 
whole  person.  You  have  to  keep  a  part  of 
yourself  detached  so  as  to  get  a  perspective  on 
things  and  to  know  what  is  happening  to  you! 
1  ought  to  know.  ..." 

In  addition  to  this  strength  and  this  new- 
assurance  that  he  has  gained,  Gary  has  ac- 
quired a  new  and  very  engaging  sophistication. 
He  fences  nimbly  with  words.  He  makes  adroit 
and  audacious  bon  mots.  He  has- — this  shy 
boy  from  Montana— acquired  a  little  of  the 
Continental  manner! 

Of  course,  there  are  the  Count  and  Countess 
di  Frasso.  That  friendship  which  sprang  up 
while  Gary  was  abroad,  and  which  led  to  the 
distinguished  pair  coming  to  Hollywood  to  take 
a  house  almost  next  door  to  his  own,  probably 
accounts  for  much  of  this  new  and  interesting 
polish.  Hollywood  has  been  pretty  agog  over 
that  situation.  Well,  there  it  is.  The  Count 
and  Countess  are  among  us.  They  spend  a 
part  of  every  day  with  Gary.  The  trio  are  in- 
separable. 

And  the  elder  couple  are  intelligent,  sophisti- 
cated, worldly  people.  Xo  disadvantage  at 
all  to  a  young  man! 

Talking  with  him  recently,  I  recalled  the 
Christmas  F.ve  before  he  went  away.  He  came 
to  spend  the  afternoon  with  me.  His  mother 
called  me  two  or  three  times  before  he  finally- 
appeared. 

"Please  tell  Gary  he  had  better  bring  his 

suit-case  in  the  house  with  him,"'  she  directed 

me,  worriedly.    "He  has  his  new  evening 

clothes  in  it  and  it  would  be  a  shame  if  they 

stolen  out  of  the  car.  .  .  .'' 

The  second  time,  she  wanted  to  know 
whether  he  had  arrived.  "  Maybe  you'd  better 
watch  for  him  and  call  to  him  when  he  appears. 
You  know,  he's  just  as  likely  as  not  to  forget 
where  he  is  going  and  drive  right  past  your 
house  in  that  vague  way  of  his.  ..." 

Good  gosh!  Wasn't  the  man  able  to  drive 
a  few  blocks  from  his  house  to  mine,  by  him- 
self, I  wondered?    What  had  come  over  Gary?

He  arrived,  eventually,  without  our  having  to 
call  out  the  police,  and  strolled  in — as  limp,  as 
wan,  as  miserable  a  human  being  as  you  ever 
saw.  That  day,  in  addition  to  his  other 
troubles,  he  had  a  cold  in  his  head.  He  helped 
me  trim  my  Christmas  tree  but  it  wasn't  a 
very  gala  occasion.  Gary  was  so  depressed 
that  he  could  baldly  speak. 

He  didn't  talk  about  his  troubles  very  much. 
Gary  has  never  been  a  complainer.  But  one 
knew.  One  knew  of  the  rift  between  Gary  and 
Lupe  (and  there  was  real  grief  in  that  parting). 
He  talked  a  little  about  his  worries  over  his 
work.  But  he  didn't  seem  to  think  that  any- 
thing could  be  done  about  anything. 

He  was  hurt  and  ill  and  silent.  He  was  a 
man  who  had  given  up. 

I  believe  Gary's  mother  came  to  Hollywood 
to  save  her  son  from  the  tangled  web  of  Holly- 
wood. It  has  been  said  that  Gary's  mother 
caused  the  break  between  Lupe  and  Gary. 
Let's  think  of  that  mother  for  a  moment. 

ATYPICAL  Middle-Western,  old-fashioned 
woman,  she  had  nourished  the  thought 
that  Gary  might  some  day  become  great. 

She  read  the  publicity  about  him  and  Clara 
Bow,  Evelyn  Brent,  Lupe  Velez.  What  more 
natural  than  for  her  to  come  to  Hollywood  to 
save  him  from  what,  to  her,  were  "those 
women"? 

Lupe  once  said  that  every  time  Gary  didn't 
do  as  his  mother  wanted  him  to,  she  became  ill. 
"She  is  just  trying  to  hold  him  by  sickness," 
Lupe  sobbed.  I  can  easily  imagine  his  mother 
saying,  "These  women  are  trying  to  take  my 
boy  from  me  with  their  appeal." 

Each  woman  behaved  according  to  her  own 
lights;  her  own  background. 

But  the  Gary  of  today  is  different.  This  one 
is  sure  that  he  has  mastered  himself  and  his 
destiny.  At  least,  he  will  put  up  a  fight  and 
that  other  Gary  wouldn't  have.  .  .  . 

This  Gary  is  self-sufficient.  "  I  shall  always 
live  alone,"  he  said.  "No  one  to  tell  me  what 
to  do — or  when- — .  No  one  to  make  scenes  or 
cry  or  have  hurt  feelings.  ...  I  am  my  own 
man- — now!" 

I  doubt  whether  Gary  will  always  live  alone ! 
He  will  marry  one  day,  almost  surely.  But  no 
one  will  ever  dominate  him,  wholly,  again.  I 
think  he  is  right  about  that.  Gary  has  learned 
a  great  deal  in  the  past  year.  .  .  . 


Heart  Throb 


If  you  should  see  us  some  afternoon 
you  would  probably  think  us  just  a 
middle-aged  nurse  and  her  charge  out 
for  an  airing.  But  oh!  how  mistaken 
you  would  be,  for  my  eleven-year-old 
son  and  I  are  off  for  our  neighborhood 
theater,  where  a  corner  is  reserved 
for  his  wheel-chair,  and  our  adven- 
ture begins. 

We're  never  quite  sure  where  the 
magic  carpet  of  our  movie  will  take  us 
and  for  that  reason  we're  always 
eager  to  go.  We  can  be  sure  that 
thrills  a-plenty  await  us,  be  our  des- 
tination metropolitan  city, Gobi  Desert, 
battle  front  or  high  seas.  With  our 
film  friends  we  may  dance,  sing,  love 
and  be  loved  and  for  a  time  share 
with  them  all  the  glamour  and  adven- 
ture which  limited  means  and  illness 
have  denied  us. 

A  woman  with  graying  hair  and  a 
little  boy  destined  never  to  walk  may 
enter  the  theater,  but  once  inside  we 
become  parties  of  a  grand  expedition 
into  the  heart  of  a  glittering,  throb- 
bing life  and  all  that  it  has  to  offer. 
Mrs.  V.  E.  Starks, 

Denver,  Colo. 


The  world's 

WOrSt  Job- 
washing 
dirty  handkerchiefs 


now  ended  by 

KLEENEX 

disposable  tissues 


Madam,  will  you  let  us  prove  to  you 
that  you  need  never  wash  another 
handkerchief? 

Send  us  your  name  and  address— 
we  will  send  you  a  trial  packet  of 
KleenexTissues.  Use  them  for  a  week, 
in  place  of  handkerchiefs. 

Then  see  if  you  can  think  of  a  sin- 
gle reason  why  you  should  continue 
that  disagreeable  task  of  washing 
handkerchiefs. 

Softest — yet  strongest  tissue 

Kleenex  is  many  times  more  absor- 
bent than  linen  or  cotton;  and  though 
the  softest  tissue  on  the  market,  it  is 
also  the  strongest. 

Because  Kleenex  costs  so  little,  you 
destroy  each  tissue  when  used. Think 
how  much  more  healthful,  to  select  a 
nice,  fresh  tissue  every  time,  instead 
of  using  a  soiled  handkerchief  over 
and  over! 

Try  Kleenex  for  removing  face 
creams,  too.  Authorities  say  it's  best, 
because  Kleenex  is  so  absorbent  that 
it  blots  all  impurities  from  the  pores. 

In  rolls  and  packages 

Kleenex  comes  in  smart  convenient 
packages  and  in  25c  rolls,  in  delicate 
pink  or  white. 

Try  both;  and  then  try  the  larger, 
household  size  as  well!  It  is  marvel- 
ously  convenient  for  guest  towels,  for 
dusting,  for  many  kitchen  tasks.

"Just  when  am  I  going?" 

Jackie  named  the  day  and  hour. 

Doug  roared.  "And  there  you're  wrong,  Mr. 
Smart}-,"  he  grinned,  "I'm  leaving  this 
evening." 

Ten  minutes  later  Bob  Montgomery,  old 
beret  perched  on  his  head,  came  into  the  dining- 
room.  The  day  of  the  sailing  had  been  changed, 
be  told  Doug. 

And  changed  to  the  exact  hour  a  little  curly- 
headed  boy  had  named. 

And  with  one  wild  war-whoop,  Doug,  Jr.  was 
up  over  the  back  of  his  chair  and  trying  to 
climb  the  dining-room  wall. 

11  AT  Kyl)ur  you  saw  a  great  big  herd  of  fierce 
-'•■animals,"  he  calmly  announced  to  Gary 
Cooper,  while  Gary  looked  wildly  about  for  a 
means  of  escape. 

It  was  Fredric  March  on  the  "Merrily  We 
Go  To  Hell "  set  who  lured  him  away  from  his 
everlasting  playing.  He  gazed  at  Freddy  in  a 
puzzled  manner.  "You  used  to  be  somebody 
else."  "Why,  no,  Jackie,"  March  said,  "I've 
always  been  me." 

A  few  minutes  later  the  child  wandered  back 
from  his  play  to  stare  long  and  hard  at  Fredric 
March.  "S'funny,"  the  boy  said,  "I  think 
you're  a  doctor,  too."  "What  doctor?" 
Freddy  asked.  "A  Dr.  Jckyll,"  the  boy  said, 
while  Freddie  threw  his  book  ten  feet  in  the  air 
and  fell  back  on  his  dressing-room  couch 
flabbergasted. 

"Let  me  hold  you  for  just  a  moment," 
George  Bancroft  begged  on  the  "Lady  and 
Gent"  set.  As  usual  the  making  of  a  picture 
was  entirely  forgotten,  as  the  crew  and  actors, 
script  girl  and  director,  flocked  about. 

It  was  his  mother's  name  called  out  to  Mr. 
Bancroft,  that  sent  him  stumbling  to  gather  a 
little  boy  up  in  his  arms. 

"Sure,"  Jackie  replied  as  Wynne  Gibson 
scribbled  a  few  words  on  a  piece  of  paper. 

"Sure  what?"  his  father  asked.  "Well." 
Jackie  said,  "she  asked  if  'The  Strange  Case  of 
Clara  Deane'  would  run  in  New  York  and  I 
said,  sure;  see  daddy?" 


Passing  Give  Brook's  dressing-room  he 
peeped  in  at  an  Knglishman  at  tea. 

"Who's  this?"  a  publicity  woman  asked. 

"It's  Clifford,"  he  said  looking  long  and 
anxiously  at  the  cake. 

"Why  Jackie,"  the  woman  said,  "that's  the 
first  time  I've  heard  you  make  a  mistake." 

But  Clive  Brook  was  putting  down  his  tea 
cup.    Shoving  back  his  cake. 

"Come  here,  son,"  he  said.  "It's  the  first 
time  I've  heard  my  name  for  a  long  time.  It 
brings  back  many  memories. 

"You  see,"  he  said,  looking  up,  "my  own 
name  is  Clifford." 

And  then  in  rapid  succession  came  the  name 
of  a  tiny  little  village  near  London — birthplace 
of  Brook,  Faith  and  Clive,  nine  and  five,  the 
Brook  children.  A  secret  pet  name  of  Mrs. 
Brook.  A  secret  plan  long  cherished,  revealed 
in  a  few  words,  and  then  a  strange  sight. 

A  calm,  dignified  Englishman  sank  slowly 
and  in  an  undignified  manner  to  the  floor,  legs 
crumpled  beneath  him,  while  Jackie  still  eyed 
the  large  square  of  cake. 

Yes,  he  has  Hollywood,  a  pretty  hard-boiled 
town,  on  its  ear. 

His  name  buzzes  from  set  to  set.  From  lot 
to  lot. 

QUT-HOLLYWOODED  by  a  child,  Holly- 
^--'wood  for  once  is  stopped  dead  in  its  tracks. 
Mystified.  Bewildered.  And  it  took  a  baby 
to  do  it. 

Jackie  is  the  son  of  a  Swiss  acrobat  whose 
mother  dropped  from  a  trapeze  to  her  death 
when  he  was  four  months  old.  Even  his  father 
is  unable  to  understand.  "I  don't  know, 
please."  is  all  he  can  say. 

"That  watch,"  he  said  to  a  tall  young 
stranger  he  met,  accidentally,  on  the  Radio 
lot.    "That  watch  in  your  pocket? 

"It  belonged  to  a  great  man.  He  was  an 
actor. 

"But  Lon  Chaney  doesn't  act  any  more." 

"He's  dead." 

And  Creighton  Chaney,  son  of  Lon, 
stumbled  away,  wondering.

clamor  grew  to  such  proportions  that  Tracy's 
agent  stepped  in  with  a  plan  that  quieted 
what  promised  to  be  a  medium  size  riot. 

He  makes  two  pictures  for  Columbia,  one 
independent,  one  for  Paramount,  two  pictures 
for  Radio  and  two  for  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 

And  there  is  the  answer  to  all  Hollywood's 
dirt    slinging. 

"You  see,"  he  says,  "I  made  my  mistake  in 
being  too  open.  Too  honest  in  what  I  did  in 
public. 

"Then,  too,  I  made  four  pictures  in  three 
months  out  here  and  I  was  tired.  Exhausted. 
I  arrived  one  morning  on  the  set  fifteen 
minutes  late.  Which  was  bad,  I  know.  The 
next  day  I  was  thirty  minutes  late  and  the 
next  one  I  didn't  get  there  till  noon.  Which 
was  just  unforgivable.  I  believe,  if  I  remember, 
it  was  after  a  week-end,"  he  grinned.  "And 
that's  the  absolute  extent  of  my  undependable- 
ness  in  Hollywood.  I  mean  it.  I've  worked 
all  day  and  all  night  without  complaint.  I've 
cooperated  in  every  way  I  know  how.  I 
played  the  lead  in  'Broadway'  on  the  New 
York  stage  for  SSO  consecutive  performances 
and  never  missed  a  single  performance.  For 
2S0  consecutive  performances  I  played  Iliidy 
Johnson  in  'The  Front  Page'  on  Broadway. 
And  didn't  mi-s  a  second's  time." 


And  this,  mind  you.  after  the  seething  tales 
we  hear  of  Mr.  Tracy's  gay  times  along 
Broadway.  He's  a  real,  regular,  honest-to- 
goodness  man's  sort  of  man,  this  Tracy  fellow. 
He  doesn't  give  a  fig  for  beautiful  women.  Or 
any  kind  of  women.  He's  never  been  married 
and  lives  his  own  life.  His  own  way.  Bother- 
ing no  one.  He  can  act  circles  and  semi- 
circles around  any  ten  average  movie  stars. 
And  does  it  with  an  ease  that's  beyond 
description. 

He's  a  humdinger  crap  shooter  and  will  sit 
in  the  bleachers  at  the  ball  game  and  scream 
himself  hoarse.  And  yell  names  at  the  umpire 
that  would  curl  a  pig's  tail.  He's  a  rooter.  A 
real  honest-to-goodness  baseball  fan.  And 
would  rather  catch  a  140  pound  tuna  than  have 
dinner  with  Garbo. 

He  attends  no  Hollywood  parties  or  open- 
ings. He's  a  regular  business  man  sort  of 
guv  in  a  slightly  goofy  business.  And  makes 
it  seem  entirely  sane.  And  natural.  The  only 
unnatural  thing  about  this  Tracy  party  is  his 
complete  indifference  to  contracts.  Movie  con- 
tracts. The  thought  of  one  gives  him  a  horrible 
breaking  out.    Just  the  thought  of  it. 

You  see  Lee  has  had  a  rather  bitter  ex- 
perience with  contracts  and  they  worry  him. 

He's  been   in   Hollywood   before,  it  seems.

The  talk  of  New  York  with  his  "Broadway," 
his  "The  Front  Page"  and  other  hits,  they 
brought  him  out  to  Fox  on  a  contract  that 
gave  him,  in  six  months'  time,  three  little 
parts  that  any  extra  could  play  blindfolded 
ami  half-dazed.  And  it  hurt  a  bit.  So  when 
Warners  offered  him  a  contract,  he  shied  off. 
But  they  kept  urging  and  urging. 

Hut  no,  Lee  felt  he'd  had  contract  fever 
once,  and  once  was  enough.  So  finally  Jimmy 
(  agney,  who,  strange  to  say,  had  been  Lee's 
understudy  in  the  play  "Broadway"  and  never 
got  a  look-in,  walked  out  on  Warners  and  left 
the  part  in  "Blessed  Event"  wide  open.  Lie 
wanted  the  part.  And  Warners  wanted  him 
to  have  it.  But  first,  they  said,  he  must  sign 
a  contract.  He  did.  He  played  "Blessed 
Event,"  was  half  a  day  late  and  walked  out 
of  Warners — with  no  contract. 

WHEN  Irving  Thalberg  offered  a  contract, 
Lee  just  couldn't  see  it,  but  is  glad  to 
play  in  those  two  M-G-M  pictures  without  a 
contract,  if  they  don'i  mind.  And  they  don't 
mind  as  long  as  Lee  plays  'em. 

So  you  see  what  a  strange  sort  of  fellow  he  is. 
Independent,  woman-shunner,  swell  actor. 

The  best  part  of  his  acting  is  done  with  his 
hands.  You  noticed  that,  perhaps,  in  "Love 
Is  a  Racket,"  "The  Strange  Case  of  Molly 
Louvain"  and  "Doctor  X."  Those  expressive, 
gesturing  hands  are  wide,  strong  and  very 
white  for  a  man's.  His  gestures  are  confined 
within  a  narrow  margin  of  space,  but  they 
speak  eloquently  of  love,  disaster,  grief  and 

joy- 
He  thinks  that  because  he  spent  half  his 
boyhood  palming  cards  and  doing  all  sorts 
of  very  bad  tricks  of  magic,  the  practice 
may  account  for  his  using  his  hands  so  much 
in  his  acting. 

He  wanted  to  be  a  magician.  Thurston's 
assistant.  The  off-stage  string-puller  and  saw 
hander-on.  But,  instead,  he  studied  electrical 
engineering.  And  landed  in  the  army,  a 
second  lieutenant,  at  Camp  Lee,  Va.  And 
went  from  the  army  to  ten  long,  barnstorming 
years  of  stage  work.  And  then  Broadway  and 
Hollywood  discovered  Lee  Tracy.  Or  Lee  dis- 
covered them. 

He's  thirty-five  years  old,  Lee  is,  and  a 
blond  with  the  keenest  pair  of  blue  eyes 
imaginable.  He's  a  bit  Scotch  and  will,  no 
matter  where,  gather  up  all  his  cigarette  butts 
and  smoke  them  again.  People  who  eat 
oranges  on  a  train  drive  him  wild.  Keep  it 
up  and  he'll  get  off  the  train  in  the  middle  of 
Death  Valley,  if  necessary.  Bananas,  now, 
aren't  so  bad.     But  oranges — 

Sort  of  set  in  his  bachelor  way,  Tracy  is. 
And  his  imitation  of  a  hen-pecking  wife 
would  roll  you  on  the  floor. 

He  has  many  friends  he's  quite  fond  of,  but 
there's  one  person  in  Lee  Tracy's  life  he  gives 
the  greatest  and  deepest  devotion.  It's  his 
mother.     They're  pals,  those  two. 

And  while  Hollywood  tongues  were  wagging 
the  hardest  over  Lee's  latest  escapade,  of  how 
he'd  told  a  certain  executive  to  go  places  and 
then  lurched  off  on  a  midnight  train  to  New 
York,  Lee  and  his  mother  were  flying  back 
home  together,  for  a  short  vacation.  And  Lee 
was  pointing  out  the  different  sights  so  that 
Mrs.  Tracy  could  read  that  paper  entitled, 
"How  I  Flew  with  My  Son,  Lee  Tracy,  Star 
of  'Blessed  Event,'  from  Hollywood  to  Wilkes- 
Barre,  Pennsylvania,"  at  the  Tuesday  after- 
noon Women's  Club. 

Does  Lee  chuckle  over  that? 

A  MAN  sidled  up  to  a  certain  producer  in 
•*  ^-Hollywood  with  a  long  tale  about  the 
newest  outbreak  of  demoralizing  Tracy. 

"Listen,"  the  producer  said  with  gestures, 
"it's  like  Lincoln  said  about  Grant  or  some- 
body when  the  boys  complained  about  him.  I 
wish  I  had  more  like  him." 

And  with  a  huge  snort,  walked  off.  And 
with  no  producer  in  these  times  willing  to 
squander  five  cents  on  an  unreliable  actor, 
there's  the  finest  answer  to  Lee  Tracy's 
whispering  chorus  that  could  be  given. 


The   painless  way  of 

SPENDING   A  PRECIOUS 


932   DOLLAR..  . 


Just  to  cast  a  glance 
at  the  new  Rollins  Hosiery  for  Fall  is 
to  find  a  sufficient  excuse  for  some 
reckless  spending  .  .  .  but.  luckily,  it 
isn't  necessary.  Not  in  these  times. 
Not  with  Rollins  Hosiery. 

For,  while  Rollins  has  the  sheerness, 
the  style,  the  appearance  to  justify 
a  spree  of  extravagance,  it  also  has 
the  price — and  the  quality — which 
make  extravagance  impossible. 

Women  who  are  as  thrifty  as  a  house- 
wife with  a  market  basket  .  .  .  and 
those  who  are  as  finicky  about  per- 
sonal appearances  as  a  deb  on  a 
man-hunt — all  are  being  very  careful 
this  season  to  go  to  the  Rollins  dealer, 
and  nowhere  else,  for  stockings. 

f's  a  thing  that  you  should  do,  too.

Marie  Dressler's  Own  Story

COMBINATION  I 
AAAA  toEEE 


that  reservoir,  when  you  need  it.  Let  ii  bubble 
up  into  your  life. 

The  magic  of  time  will  have  mellowed  all 
memories  into  helpfulness. 

Not  Ion;;  ago,  when  I  was  very  ill  and  could 
only  lie  hour  after  hour  and  think,  a  mi 
came  to  me  from  an  old  sweetheart.  He  wrote, 
".Marie,  you  have  something  within  you  that 
will  never  allow  your  soul  to  be  crushed.''  I 
was  happy  to  get  that  letter.  We  had  remained 
friends  for  many  years,  long  after  romance 
failed.  When  you  have  loved  and  parted, 
always  leave  a  loophole  through  which  you 
may  find  each  other  and  share  in  a  different 
way  those  mutual  things  which  made  you 
ovi  rs.  Hut  I  wondered  what  was  the  thing 
I  had  which  would  not  allow  my  soul  to  be 
crushed  by  illness,  by  pain,  by  disappointment 
or  loneliness. 

iVrhaps  I  am  wrong,  but  I  think  he  meant 
courage  to  light.  I  was  given  that,  it  seems, 
in  the  beginning.  It  is  good  to  be  a  lighter, 
if  you  light  in  a  good  cause. 

T  AM  afraid  of  only  two  things  in  the  world. 
■*■  Fear  and  self. 

l-'ear  is  the  devil's  only  weapon.  I  look  back 
now  over  my  life  and  realize  that  there  is 
nothing,  absolutely  nothing,  ever  to  fear.  If  I 
could  pass  on  to  you  one  thought,  share  with 
you  one  thing  that  life  has  taught  me,  it  would 
be  that  there  is  nothing  to  fear.  We  magnify, 
we  worry,  we  make  ourselves  subject  to  fear. 

When  you  have  experienced  everything  that 
life  can  deal  out  to  you,  when  you  have  passed 
through  every  human  experience,  when  you 
have  seen  birth  and  death,  war  and  pestilence, 
poverty  and  riches,  hunger  and  satiety,  you 
will  know  that  life  has  nothing  to  offer  that  you 
can't  meet. 

That  is  the  truth.  And  you  can  meet  it  and 
get  something  out  of  it  and  survive  it  and  be 
happy.    Within  yourself. 

The  unhappy  people  are  those  who  think  too 
much  about  themselves.  They  kill  themselves 
by  thinking  too  much  of  self. 

Don't  you  know  that  there  is  nothing  and 
nobody  with  whom  you  can  live  twenty-four 
hours  a  day,  year  in  and  year  out?  Why  make 
yourself  an  exception?  Escape  from  yourself. 
Love  others — be  interested  in  others,  really  and 
genuinely — enjoy  and  sorrow  with  them.  The 
right  kind  of  tears  shed  for  others  will  wash 
away  bitterness  and  resentment  and  envy  and 
jealousy. 

Sorrow  never  kills.  Envy  and  jealousy  and 
bitterness  and  resentment  do.  They  kill  the 
spirit  and  the  soul. 

And  they  are  all  children  of  self — self-love, 
self-glorification,  self-pity.  Escape  from  your- 
self at  any  cost. 

You  have  only  one  obligation  to  self.  To  live 
up  to  the  highest  you  see.  To  live  for  yourself 
only  so  as  to  make  yourself  a  better  person  for 
the  rest  of  the  world  to  live  with  and  love  with 
and  laugh  with. 

TN  the  days  of  my  youth.  I  believed  that 
-'•religion  was  confined  within  the  narrow  walls 
of  a  church.  I  don't  believe  that  any  more.  All 
roads  to  Ck>d  arc  good  roads.  We  need  not  look 
for  too  narrow  a  path. 

The  Church — the  real  Church — is  within  us 
— the  Temple  of  the  Living  God.  Hut  some- 
times now  we  feel  that  churches  are  too  selfish, 
that  people  who  go  to  them  go  to  pray  for 
something  for  themselves,  that  they  are  light- 
ing for  themselves  only. 

And  I  know  now  that  we  shall  be  judged  by 
one  record  and  one  record  only.  The  record  we 
have  lift  in  the  hearts  of  those  with  whom  we 
came  in  contact.  That  makes  it  very  simple, 
very  i  asy,  doesn't  it? 

I  learned  a  great  lesson  from  a  great  woman 
when  I  was  a  very  young  actn  ss 


.Mrs  Stuyvesant  Fish,  the  social  leader  of 
New  York,  was  very  kind  to  me  and  befriended 
me. 

One  day  when  we  were  driving  in  the  Park 
together — at  the  very  beginning  of  our 
acquaintance — we  passed  a  Victoria  in  which 
sat  a  beautiful  young  woman.  As  our  car- 
riages came  abreast,  the  woman  dropped  her 
Hut  I — I  was  young  and  bubbling  and 
friendly — called  and  waved  to  her.  When  she 
had  gone  by,  Mrs.  Fish  said  to  me,  "Marie, 
who  was  that  divine  creature?  '  I  hesitated. 
We  were  not  as  free  in  our  speech  then  as  we 
are  now.  I  said,  "She  is  a  girl  I  met  in  the 
theater.  Hut  she  isn't  in  the  theater  now.  I — 
I  feel  very  sorrv  for  her.  I  think  she  needs  a 
friend." 

A/fR^-  FISH  put  her  arm  about  me  and  said, 
"X"My  (lcar  J  ;irn  proud  that  you  re- 
membered to  speak  to  her.  That  endears  you 
to  me.    Never  change,  Marie.'' 

Now,  1  didn't  deserve  any  credit.  I  had 
done  it  without  thought.  If  I  had  stopped  to 
realize  the  girl's  position,  and  that  I  was  with 
Mrs.  Fish,  I  might  have  been  afraid.  But  it 
taught  me  a  great  lesson. 

Kindness,  friendliness,  is  always  so  much 
gain.  And  when  folks  are  up  against  it,  when 
the  breaks  are  going  against  them,  that  is 
when  they  need  us. 

After  all,  who  are  we  to  condemn? 

A  cardinal  of  the  Church  of  Rome  once  re- 
minded me  that  there  were  three  crosses  upon 
the  hill  of  Calvary.  Upon  two  of  them  hung 
thieves.  But  upon  the  third,  hung  Christ.  It 
might  have  been  very  easy  to  miss  Him  al- 
together. 

We  must  never  condemn.  Let  us  fight  evil. 
Let  us  try  to  help  others. 

If  we  cannot,  let  us  pass  on.  But  always 
without  condemnation. 

As  I  grow  older  and  life  seems  simpler  to  me 
each  day,  I  often  remember  that  Dante  did  not 
put  into  his  hell  those  who  committed  crimes 
or  deeds  of  passion.  The  greatest  of  poets 
painted  there  only  the  unloving.  Only  the  un- 
forgiving. 

There  is  too  much  talk  about  even-thing, 
anyway.  Almost  everybody  talks  too  much. 
During  the  war.  when  we  were  gathered  to 
make  plans  for  raising  money,  for  selling  bonds, 
for  helping  our  boys,  it  was  decided  that  we 
should  send  out  speakers.  Then  I  got  up  and 
said,  "All  right.  Let  them  speak,  but  for 
heaven's  sake  limit  them  or  they'll  talk  every- 
body to  death  and  there'll  be  no  one  left  to  buy 
bonds."  That  was  the  origin  of  the  four- 
minute  men. 

"Y\  7E  have  been  going  through  lately  what 
^*  some  people  call  a  bad  time. 

I  cannot  agree  with  that.  It  is  the  finest  and 
the  greatest  time  that  has  ever  happened  to  the 
United  States  of  America. 

Had  we  gone  on  as  we  were  a  few  years  ago, 
we  should  have  gone  under — we  should  have 
fallen  as  Babylon  fell,  as  Rome  fell. 

We  had  lost  God.  we  had  lost  our  sense  of 
values,  our  sense  of  humor,  our  "guts"  and  our 
strength. 

There  was  a  little  family  in  the  Middle  West 
that  made  candles  by  hand  for  many  years. 
They  just  eked  out  a  living  for  themselves  and 
when  they  heard  of  the  depression  they  were 
frightened,  for  a  very  little  depression  would 
make  an  end  of  them.  But.  suddenly,  business 
picked  up.  They  had  orders  and  more  orders. 
People  were  burning  many  candles.  They  had 
remembered  God. 

The  other  night  a  man  dined  with  me — an 
old  friend.  He  is  the  head  of  a  great  drug 
concern.  He  told  me  that  business  was  bad. 
"We  aren't  selling  many  drugs  because  people 
are  too  busy  to  be  sick."

My  servants,  who  have  been  with  me,  in 
good  times  and  bad,  for  twenty  years,  have  a 
brother  who  is  an  undertaker  in  a  small 
Southern  town. 

He  had  planned  to  come  to  the  Coast  this 
year,  but  he  wrote  that,  because  business  was 
so  bad,  he  could  not  make  it.  "People,"  he 
said,  "are  too  poor  to  die." 

Yes,  the  depression  has  been  a  good  thing. 
Some  of  us  have  suffered  greatly,  but  in  the 
end  we  shall  all  be  closer  to  God. 

There  is  nothing  in  the  world  so  unimportant 
as  money. 

I  shall  be  criticized  for  saying  that.  We, 
who  have  made  the  golden  calf  our  idol  for  the 
past  years,  do  not  like  to  hear  that  said.  But 
it  is  true. 

THE  women  of  this  country  have  been  falling 
down  on  their  jobs.  A  woman  occupies  the 
greatest  place  in  the  world.  What  is  that 
place?  It  is  to  be  the  inspiration,  the  com- 
forter, the  helper. 

It  is  her  job  to  prevent  panics,  to  hold 
steady  the  ship  of  life.  To  fortify  husbands 
and  sons  and  fathers.  To  keep  the  glow  of 
joy  burning  in  every  home. 

That  is  woman's  first  business.  To  keep 
God  alive  in  the  heart  of  the  world. 

When  my  husband  was  dying  he  said  to  me, 
"Marie,  I  am  not  afraid  to  die,  because  I  know 
that  God  loves  me  as  you  love  me." 

That  is  my  crown  for  all  time. 

That  is  the  crown  of  womanhood  for  all  time. 
That,  in  times  of  trouble,  men  should  turn  to  a 
woman  and  know  that  fear  cannot  triumph, 
that  faith  is  still  alive  somewhere,  that  bravery 
still  flings  high  its  banner. 


Bill  Powell  Exposed 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  4-7  ] 

overwhelms  him  and  all  the  clever  speeches 
melt  into  thin  air.  He  turns  into  a  near- 
Sphinx. 

"My  brain  fogs  in  a  maze  of  self-conscious- 
ness," Powell  told  me  once,  "and  I  suffer 
agonies  until  the  interviewer  bids  me  goodbye." 

Strangely — and  luckily — his  self-effacement 
disappears  the  minute  Powell  faces  a  camera. 
I  have  studied  this  miracle,  and  I  believe  it 
can  be  traced  to  the  fact  that  Bill  actually 
assumes  the  character  of  the  person  he  por- 
trays on  the  screen. 

He  moves  from  the  body  of  the  real  William 
Powell  into  the  guise  of  the  screen  Powell. 
He  forgets  himself  in  the  character  of  the  role 
he  portrays. 

"V"ES,  Bill's  confessed  inferiority  complex  ex- 
*■  plains  clearly  the  side  of  him  that  has  al- 
ways puzzled  me.  You  see,  among  his  real 
friends,  Powell  suffers  no  ill  effects  from  his 
complex.  He  is  as  charming  a  host  as  Holly- 
wood boasts. 

An  evening  in  his  company  is  as  entertaining 
and  rewardful  as  an  evening  with  O.  Henry 
or  de  Maupassant.  He  is  as  full  of  information 
as  the  encyclopedia;  as  up-to-date  as  today's 
newspaper. 

In  brief,  he  is  exactly  the  sophisticate  of  the 
screen.    That's  among  friends. 

Among  strangers,  he  is  all  the  things  I  have 
told  you  before. 

It  is  when  he  is  among  strange  people 
that  I  feel  a  real  sympathy  for  Bill. 

Persons  who  are  not  cursed  with  inferiority 
complexes  cannot  fully  understand  the  anguish 
Powell  goes  through  every  day.  Those  who 
have  such  complexes  will  appreciate  Bill's 
suffering,  and  will  feel  a  new  and  warmer  com- 
radeship toward  him.  They  will  understand 
that  he  is  really  a  grand  guy  afraid  of  his 
Nemesis. 

They  will  know  William  Powell  for  what  he 
is — a  man  haunted  by  his  shadow — his  screen 
shadow.

Don't 

Gamble 

on  secret  formulas 

in  Laxatives! 


Don't  take  any  laxative  unless  you  know 
what  is  in  it ! 

Beware  of  any  laxative  made  by  a  secret 
formula.  It  isn't  enough  that  it  "works". 
It  must  work  safely. 

The  wrong  sorts  of  laxatives  do  more 
harm  than  good,  and  doctors  will  warn  you 
against  them.  Many  of  them  are  viciously 
habit-forming. 

No  secret  about  Ex-Lax 

Ex-Lax  contains  a  single  medicinal  ingredi- 
ent— the  scientific  laxative,  phenolphthalein. 

The  exclusive  formula  of  Ex-Lax  is  sim- 
ply the  perfect  blending,  into  a  delicious 
chocolated  base,  of  phenolphthalein — of  the 
right  quality,  in  the  correct  proportion  and 
the  correct  dose. 

Doctors  approve  the  Ex -Lax  way.  It 
checks  on  every  point  they  look  for  in  a 
laxative. 

Since  Ex-Lax  was  offered  to  the  public 
26  years  ago,  many  laxatives  have  come 
and  gone.  Yet  Ex-Lax  is  still  the  leading 
laxative,  holding  its  millions  of  old  friends, 
and  winning  hosts  of  new  ones  every  year. 

Acts  as  Nature  does 

li«x-Lax  simply  "nudges"  the  intestinal 
muscles  gently  and  so  stimulates  the  bowels 
to  gentle  activity.  It  does  not  force  or  gripe. 
It  doesn't  disturb  digestion.  It  acts  naturally, 
but  surely.    It  isn't  habit-forming. 

Tastes  like  delicious  chocolate 

There  is  no  more  delightful  way  of  taking 
a  safe,  gentle  laxative  than  the  Ex-Lax  way.

room  from  the  most  beautifully  toned  vocal 
cords  of  the  American  theater.  "Who  is 
thai  so  and  so  who  is  talking?" 

Other  words  follow — curt,  vigorous,  expres- 
sive. The  saintly  expression  never  leaves  the 
face  of  the  praying  woman.  The  cameras  do 
not  stop  grinding  until  the  scene  is  completed. 

At  last  it's  over.  The  Queen  rises.  Her 
knees  crackle.  An  ankle  turns.  Snap.  A 
ligament  is  out  of  place.  That  means  a  stiff 
bandage  throughout  the  remainder  of  the 
picture. 

Fortunately,  the  clothes  of  the  Romanoff 
czarinas  always  covered  the  ankles! 

She  stumbles  to  the  assistant  director.  "Who 
did  that  talking  while  I—" 

Boss  Lionel  had  been  the  one  talking.  Ethel 
may  have  been  a  Czarina  but  to  him  she  was 
no  Queen.  Just  a  sister.  Why  should  he 
remain  silent? 

"Well,  it  was  your  fault  anyway.  It's  your 
business  to  keep  people  quiet,  isn't  it?"  she 
turned  to  the  assistant. 

What  she  said  to  Lionel  will  never  go  down 
in  history.  It  was  within  the  private  chambers 
of  the  Romanoffs. 

Referee  Brabin  acted  exactly  as  though  noth- 
ing had  happened. 

To  fully  comprehend  this  Barrymore  situa- 
tion, you  must  know  something  of  the  tradition 
of  the  American  stage.  The  Barrymores  are 
that  tradition.  Generations — including  the  one 
of  John  Drew — have  immortalized  them.  Ethel 
Barrymore  could  take  a  bad  play  out  on  the 
road  (not  that  she  has!)  and  give  it  a  bad 
performance  and  still  do  a  capacity  house 
business  in  every  town.  She  is  the  absolute 
Queen  of  the  American  stage  and  the  Queen 
can  do  no  wrong. 

The  Barrymores  can  do  no  wrong.     It  is 


the  inherited  psychology  of  all  royal  families. 
It  is  the  birthright  to  which  they  are  born, 
bred,  educated.  They  must  believe  it  or  they 
could  not  live  it. 

It  is  what  the  Romanoffs  believed.  Who 
better  to  interpret  this  regal  tradition? 

But  Queen  Ethel  has  had  no  real  screen 
experience.  She  knows  acting  but  not  pan- 
tomime. It  was  not  to  be  expected  that  she 
should  drop  into  the  tricks  of  this  new  trade 
without  making  mistakes.  It  would  not  be 
human,  and  even  royalty  is  human. 

She  circled  about  the  set  in  the  grand 
mannerisms  of  the  traditional  stage  Ethel 
But  the  circles  were  a  bit  screen-awkward. 
The  gestures  of  the  arms  would  have  rather 
over-shadowed  her  personality — on  the  screen. 

Lionel  looked  at  Brabin;  Brabin  looked  at 
Lionel.  Boss  Lionel  took  his  position  opp 
Ethel.  lie  read  his  lines.  In  between  them 
he  stage-whispered  to  Ethel.  "Lower  that 
arm.  Turn  the  other  way.  Take  it  slowly, 
kid;  take  it  slowly." 

Then  another  line  from  the  script — loud  and 
emphatic;  in  the  best  Lionel  manner.  Then 
another  whispered  warning  to  Ethel.  Easing 
her  along  into  the  technique  which  she  must 
master  if  she  is  to  uphold  the  tradition  of  the 
Barrymore  regality. 

She  took  her  cues  from  Boss  Barrymore, 
confident  that  those  watching  could  not  know 
what  she  was  doing. 

But  when  anyone  else  attempted  to  help! 
Referee  Brabin  suggested  she  should  stand  in 
a  certain  position.     "But  I  stood  there!" 

He  repeated  a  line  for  her.  "But  I  said  it 
that  way!" 

The  Queen  could  do  no  wrong.  To  an  out- 
sider. 

The    supervisor    took    a    hand.      "But    the 


Gentlemen,  the  Queen!  And  a  queen  who,  like  Garbo,  can  do 
no  wrong  in  the  eyes  of  thousands  of  devoted  theater-followers. 
Now,  since  Ethel  joined  brothers  Lionel  and  John  on  the 
"Rasputin"   set,  the  entire  Barrymore  clan  are  in  Big  Time 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  October,  1932 


Czarina  wouldn't  do  it  that  way,  Miss  Barry- 
more." 

"Oh,  wouldn't  she!  You  forget  I  knew  Her 
Majesty  personally.  It  is  exactly  as  she  would 
have  done  it." 

Thi  supervisor  might  have  answered  that  it 
wasn't  the  way  the  Czarina  would  have  done 
it  before  a  camera,  but  he  didn't.  He  acted 
as  though  nothing  unusual  had  happened. 

Nor  was  this  a  pose  on  the  part  of  Ethel. 
She  was  a  personal  friend  of  the  woman  whom 
she  is  portraying.  They  met  while  the 
Czarina  was  in  London  for  the  funeral  of  Queen 
Victoria.  Her  Majesty  of  Russia  was  told 
that  there  was  a  famous  actress  in  town  who 
looked  remarkably  like  her.  She  asked  that 
actress  Ethel  be  presented.  They  became  as 
chummy  as  royalty  becomes  chummy. 

And  John  Barrymore  knew  Grand  Duke 
Alexander  and  Prince  Voussoupoff .  They  used 
to  quaff  each  other's  health.  The  part  cf 
Paul  which  John  plays  in  the  picture  is  a  com- 
bination of  these  two  men  who  were  his 
personal  acquaintances. 

["  IONEL  alone  did  not  know  the  Russian 
-'-'nobility.  He  could  not  be  outclassed  by  the 
other  members  of  this  League  of  Blood  Re- 
lations!   He  could  read.    He  did. 

And  if  you  asked  the  members  of  that  cast 
to  vote  on  the  Barrymore  who  knows  the 
most  about  the  Russian  Royal  family,  I'll 
wager  they'd  all  vote  for  Lionel.  Except  Ethel 
and  John. 

Lionel  learned  so  much  that  he  even  cor- 
rected the  instructions  for  his  own  wardrobe 
before  Natalie  Bucknell,  head  of  the  research 
department,  caught  the  error  in  the  script. 
The  script  called  for  the  Mad  Monk,  Ras- 
putin, (who  is  Lionel)  to  wear  sandals.  But 
the  real  Mad  Monk  wore  boots.  On  the  first 
day  of  the  picture,  Miss  Bucknell  went  to  the 
set  to  tell  Lionel  of  the  error.  She  found  him 
in  boots.     She  said  nothing  about  it. 

That  script !  It  is  being  revised  from  day  to 
day,  from  hour  to  hour.  No  one  knows  in  the 
morning  just  how  the  lines  will  run  in  the 
afternoon.     Not  even  Referee  Brabin. 

They  were  not  ready  to  start  "Rasputin," 
but  Queen  Ethel  had  to  make  it  now  or  never. 
She  was  due  back  on  Broadway  in  the  autumn. 
Only  six  weeks  could  her  majesty  give  them. 
Writer  Charlie  MacArthur  was  instructed  to 
prepare  the  words  as  they  were  needed  for  the 
mouths  of  the  Barrymores. 

Perhaps  it's  just  as  well.  The  Barrymores 
are  really  helping  to  write  it.  MacArthur 
doesn't  object,  now.  He's  happy  to  have 
assistance — or  direction.  But  if  he  had  worked 
for  months  and  completed  a  script  it  might 
have  been  difficult  for  him  to  deport  himself 
as  though  nothing  unusual  were  happening 
when  each  word  of  his  was  revamped  through 
a  Barrymore  inspiration. 

•"PHE  other  day,  it  was  the  word  "graft" 
■*■  which  stalled  production  for  several  hours. 

"But  they  must  have  the  word  'graft,'" 
author,  supervisor  and  referee  argued. 

"But  they  would  never  use  it  in  the  court!" 
the  Barrymores  grunted. 

Two  hours  later  the  word  was  changed  to 
dishonesty. 

Of  course,  it  is  only  natural  that  the  Barry- 
mores should  desire  that  Court  of  St.  James 
English  be  used  in  Russia. 

Who  ever  heard  of  American  grammar  or 
slang  or  pronunciation  going  into  the  throne 
room  of  any  country? 

Poor  little  Tad  Alexander,  who  plays  the 
Czarevitch  Alexis,  is  having  the  toughest  time 
with  this  royal  language.  He  hails  from 
Iowa. 

And  although  it  is  easy  to  take  little  boys 
out  of  Iowa,  it  is  almost  impossible  to  take 
Iowa  out  of  little  boys. 

Ethel  has  undertaken  the  task.  She  spends 
hours  in  a  corner  of  the  set  training  him  in  the 
correct  manner  of  royal  speech.  And  there 
are  already  rumors  that  Tad  is  likely  to  give 
a  surprise  performance. 


Pepsodent 
Antiseptic 

will  save  you  $2 

and  offers  you  over 
50  different  uses 


PEPSODENT  ANTISEPTIC  is  3  times 
as  powerful  as  other  leading  mouth 
antiseptics.  Hence  it  goes  3  times 
as  far.  And  whether  you  buy  the 
25c,  50c  or  $1  size  you  still  get 
3  times  as  much  for  your  money 


EVERYBODY  is  trying  to 
stretch  the  dollar— so  here's 
a  way  to  make  your  dollar  for 
antiseptic  stretch  as  far  as  three. 
Change  to  the  new  discovery 
—  Pepsodent  Antiseptic.  You 
seePepsodent  Antiseptic  is  three 
times  as  powerful  as  other  lead- 
ing mouth  antiseptics— by  adding 
water  you  make  it  go  three  times 
as  far— get  three  times  as  much  for 
your  money— get  extra  protection 
against  sore  throat  colds,  also  against 
unpleasant  breath. 

When  you  pick  your  mouth  antiseptic 
you  have  two  leading  kinds  from  which 
to  choose.  You  have  the  antiseptic  that 
must  be  used  full  strength  to  be  effective. 
Or  you  have  Pepsodent  Antiseptic  that 
is  powerful  enough  to  be  diluted  and 
still  be  effective,  yet  is  utterly  safe  when 
used  full  strength.  Add  two  parts  of  water 
if  you  wish— it  still  kills  germs  in  10  seconds. 

It's  costly  enough  to  use  an  antiseptic 
that  should  be  used  full  strength.  But  it's 
a  lot  more  costly  to  dilute  that  antiseptic 
and  fail  to  kill  the  germs.  That's  why  we 
warn  you  to  choose  an  antiseptic  that  can 
be  mixed  with  water  and  still  kill  germs. 
Insist  on  Pepsodent  Antiseptic— devel- 
oped by  the  laboratories  famous  through- 
out the  world  as  authorities  in  matters  of 
oral  hygiene.  Be  safe.  Safeguard  the  health 
of  your  family— and  save  your  money.

Meantime  John  and  Lionel  settle  their 
share  of  the  family  arguments.  Certainly, 
John  and  Lionel  argue.  They  are  Barry- 
mores, too,  aren't  they? 

of  course,  the  picture  should  have  opened 
with  Mad  Monk  Lionel  between  two  beautiful 
blondes.  That  was  the  way  the  story  was 
intended.  What  a  scene!  All  the  executives

scene  can  give  preference  to  one  over  the 
others. 

There   was  no  one  resourceful  enough    to 
figure  a  way  to  bring  the  Czarina  and  /' 
1'iiid  into  such  an  intimate  introduction.    So  it 
was  dropped  from  the  picture. 

TJTHEL  had  several  hours  to  concentrate  on 
-^taking  Iowa  out  of  the  Czarevitch  on  the 
second  day  of  the  picture.  John  and  Lionel 
had  a  scene  in  which  John  asked  Mad  Monk 
Lionel  to  leave  the  room. 

You  know  it  is  Prince  Paul  John  who  courts 
the  death  of  this  too-tempting  Monk  through- 
out the  story. 

As  they  left  the  set,  John  took  Lionel's  arm 
and  gently  propelled  him  forward. 

Now,  Lionel  didn't  object  to  being  asked  to 
leave  but  when  it  came  to  being  helped — that 
was  another  matter.  The  real  Monk  wouldn't 
have  stood  for  it — .  Besides,  it  did  give  John  an 
extra  piece  of  business.  You've  heard  of  those 
tricks  for  scene  stealing. 

There  were  several  hours  of  argument. 
Referee  Brabin  shot  it  both  ways  and  acted 
exactly  as  though  nothing  unusual  had 
happened. 

Rumors  have  leaked  from  that  set  that  the 
three  Barrymores  were  erecting  a  united  front 
to  the  world  and  allowing  no  outside  actor  or 
actress  to  get  an  inning  in  their  picture. 

These  are  untrue.  The  Barrymores  chose 
Ralph  Morgan,  Purnell  Pratt  and  Diana 
Wynyard.  They  have  known  them  and  ap- 
proved their  work  for  years.  They  are  giving 
them  every  opportunity  to  make  the  mest  of 
their  supporting  roles. 

A  Morgan  or  a  Pratt  may  steal  a  scene  if 
he  can.  But  not  a  Barrymore!  Ah,  well, 
that  is  a  family  matter.  They  do  erect  a 
united  front  to  the  world.  Barrymores,  one 
and  all. 

It's  going  to  be  one  of  those  famed  million- 
dollar  productions.  Exact  in  every  detail. 
A  jeweler  was  imported  from  Xew  York  to 


make  a  replica  of  the  Russian  Crown  jewels 
for  Czarina  Ethel.  Each  stone  is  made  to 
exact  scale. 

And  her  court  gown  cost  $4,800. 

She  doesn't  wear  the  dog  collar.  Metro  has 
an  excuse. 

Something  about  a  scene  not  being  included 
where  a  dog  collar  is  appropriate.  I  have 
an  excuse,  too. 

A  dog  collar  is  uncomfortable  and  a  bit 
awkward  even  for  so  slender  a  queenly  neck 
as  Hthel's. 

The  sets  are  also  true  reproductions.  They 
were  copied  from  the  leaves  of  the  famous  Gold 
Book  with  its  solid  gold  covers,  valued  at 
more  than  SIO.(KK).  There  were  only  two  in 
a  museum  at  Moscow.  One  was  ancther 
refugee  importation  to  Hollywood.  It  con- 
tains colored  pictures  of  all  of  the  palaces  of 
old  Russia. 

The  cathedral  ceremonies!  The  cathedral- 
room  is  four  hundred  feet  long  and  covers  two 
sound  stages. 

The  crown-room  ceremonies!  The  crown- 
room  is  four  hundred  feet  long  and  covers  the 
same  area. 

Thousands  of  extras !  Russians  and  Russian- 
bewhiskered  Americans. 

But  when  you  watch  these  stupendous 
scenes  reminiscent  of  the  old  days  of  silent 
pictures,  where  is  the  usual  bustle  of  excite- 
ment? Where  are  the  eagerly  told  "naughty" 
stories? 

Where,  oh  where,  are  the  card  players  who 
can  be  found  behind  the  scenes  of  any  other 
picture  ever  filmed? 

Has  a  miracle  happened?  Has  the  depres- 
sion sucked  away  the  cosmopolitan  atmosphere 
of  picturedom? 

No,  not  the  depression.  Just  the  Barry- 
mores. 

pYLRYBODY  walks  on  tip-toe.  Talks  in 
■^—'whispers.  Goes  off  the  stage  to  gossip. 
Only  three  voices  are  heard  in  normal  tones  on 
the  set. 

They  come  from  the  throats  of  the  three 
Barrymores.  While  everyone  is  trying  to  act 
before  them  as  though  nothing  unusual  were 
happening. 

And  here's  the  joker!  These  Barrymores 
are  so  busy  protecting  the  good  John  Barry- 
more  profile,  the  good  Ethel  Barrymore  profile 
(oh,  yes  she  has  her  best  side,  too!*,  and  the 
good  temper  of  Boss  Barrymore  that  they  are 
the  only  ones  on  that  set  who  actually  act  as 
though  nothing  unusual  were  happening. 


Consolation  Marriage?  Well — Hardly!

work  of  nature  is  the  Empire  State  Building 
and  where  would  I  get  a  manicure  in  the  moun- 
tains?" 

It  was  then  that  I  wanted  to  shake  her. 

Several  months  later  Dorothy's  voice  came 
to  me  over  a  telephone  wire. 

"CIT  steady."  she  warned  hysterically.  "Hold 
^onto  something  tight.  In  ten  minutes  Bill 
and  I  are  hopping  off  to  Arizona  or  New 
Mexico  or  some  funny  place  to  get  married.  I 
told  him  he'd  have  to  make  it  snappy  before  I 
changed  my  mind." 

Later  I  learned  that  they  didn't  have  time  to 
get  a  ring  and  they  were  married  with  a  star 
sapphire  that  Bill  had  given  her  on  her  birth- 
day. 

I  wondered  what  was  going  to  happen.  I 
knew  how  well  Dorothy  liked  parties.  I 
thought  that  she  could  not  exist  without  a  lot 
of  people  around  to  tell  her  how  pretty  she  was 
and  what  a  good  dancer,  and  I  thought  that 
maybe  she  was  going  to  spoil  a  swell  person  like 
Bill  Boyd  by  stuffing  him  into  a  dinner  jacket 
every  night  of  his  life. 


And  then  a  funny  thing  happened.  Up  until 
her  marriage  Dorothy's  name  had  been  in  the 
papers  almost  every  day — she  was  seen  at  this 
and  that  function,  dancing  with  this  and  that 
new  beau. 

But  after  the  wedding  was  duly  recorded 
in  the  public  prints  you  didn't  see  either 
Dorothy's  or  Bill's  name  for  months. 

"pOR  about  a  year  and  a  half  I  didn't  see 
■*-  them.  It  was  hard  to  get  Dorothy  on  the 
phone.  You  would  call  up  the  Beverly  Hills 
house  and  find  that  they  were  at  the  beach 
place. 

And  if  you  got  a  connection  to  the  beach 
they  were  sure  to  be  out  on  Bill's  yacht. 

In  the  meantime,  I  spent  several  months  in 
Xew  York  and  one  note  from  Dot  told  me  she 
was  too  busy  to  write.  When  I  got  back  to 
Hollywood  she  called  me.  "I'm  crazy  to  see 
you,"  she  said. 

"There's  a  party  being  given  for  me  this 
afternoon,"  I  said,  "why  don't  you  come  to 
that?" 

She  hesitated.     "Well,  honey,  I  don't  like

parties  very  well.    You  stop  by  the  house  after- 
wards." 

What  I  found  in  that  charming  house  on 
Arden  Drive  is  something  I'll  never  forget. 
Bill  answered  the  door  himself.  Dorothy  was 
right  behind  him  in  a  little  printed  chiffon 
dress  and  looking  prettier  than  I've  ever  seen 
her. 

"T  OOK  at  her,"  Bill  said,  "she's  a  sissy.  She's 
-'-'got  on  a  dress.  Just  wants  to  make  an  im- 
pression. She  hasn't  had  on  a  dress  for  weeks 
— goes  around  all  the  time  in  white  duck  pants 
and  an  old  sweater." 

"Stop,"  I  said,  "I  can't  bear  it.  Dorothy 
was  always  so  crazy  about  smart  clothes." 

"  \Yell,  that's  all  changed,"  Bill  beamed. 
'She's  a  different  girl  now." 

"  Yes,  I  am,  honestly,  honey,"  she  said  and 
all  that  tenseness  was  gone  out  of  her  voice. 
Her  mouth,  which  used  to  set  itself  in  a  hard 
line,  was  soft  and  smiling. 

I  sank  to  a  chair.  "  Come  on,  give  in.  Out 
with  the  story." 

It  seems  that  Bill  worked  it  all  out  very  care- 
fully. Knowing  so  surely  where  happiness  was 
— or  at  least  where  it  wasn't — he  began  to  show 
Dot  how  rich  life  could  be  if  lived  simply  and 
that  you  could  work  in  pictures  without  kow- 
towing to  anybody  or  playing  anybody's  social 
game. 

For  Bill  Boyd  has  worked  steadily  as  a  star 
for  years  and  years  and  is,  today,  one  of  the 
wealthiest  men  in  Hollywood — and  he  has  bent 
no  hinges  of  the  knee  to  anybody. 

They  spend  most  of  their  time  on  Bill's 
yacht.  It  isn't  a  smart  yacht,  either,  but  just 
a  comfortable  old  sloop  that  goes  about  any- 
where they  want  to  go.  There  they  loll  around 
in  white  ducks  and  sweaters  and  watch  the 
rhythmic  rising  and  falling  of  the  sea  and  are 
happy. 

That  is,  of  course,  when  Bill  is  between 
pictures.  But  even  when  he  is  working  they 
spend  as  little  time  as  possible  in  town  and  go 
almost  every  night  to  the  beach  place  where 
ihey  shut  themselves  off  from  everybody  but 
the  people  they  really  and  truly  want  to  see. 

They  have  a  few  friends — firm,  fast  friends 
who  like  them  for  what  they  are  and  not  for 
their  influence  or  power. 

I'll  bet  that  the  girls  who  used  to  work  with 
Dorothy  in  the  chorus  in  New  York  couldn't 
believe  that  she  is  what  she  is  now  and  that  she 
is  leading  this  sort  of  life  because  it's  the  way 
she  wants  to  live. 

In  love!'  Say,  you  never  saw  anything  like 
it! 

He  calls  her  "mother"  and  she  calls  him 
"pa"  and  the  little  brooks  of  understanding  and 
sympathy  that  flow  between  them  would  make 
your  eyes  grow  misty. 

No  silly  stuff,  mind  you,  no  lovey-dovey 
talk  and  public  petting — just  a  real  love  and 
tenderness. 

"  It  took  me  quite  a  while  to  learn  about  this 
sort  of  life,"  Dorothy  said.  "I  told  Bill  it  was 
awful  to  shut  ourselves  away  like  this  and  be 
hermits. 

"So  he  said,  'Okay,  let's  go  out  dancing.' 
Well,  we  got  all  dressed  up  and  went  to  one  of 
the  places  I  used  to  think  were  grand.  And 
about  ten  o'clock  I  was  so  bored  I  couldn't 
stand  it.  All  the  time  I  kept  thinking,  1  wish 
I  were  on  our  little  old  boat." 


-this  Boyd.     No  telling  her 
Just  letting  her 


SMART  fellow- 
what  to  do. 

No  high  handed  attitude, 
see  for  herself  what  was  right. 

"  You  don't  have  to  play  politics  and  go  to 
all  those  smart  places,"  Bill  said,  "to  get  along.- 
I  never  have  and  I  never  will  and  1  haven't 
exactly  starved  yet.  We  know  that  if  we  go 
out  a  lot  we'll  run  the  risk  of  having  misunder- 
standings. Lots  of  people  in  Hollywood  don't 
seem  to  realize  that  two  folks  can  be  married 
and  still  like  each  other." 

"And  how  long  is  this  going  to  last?  "  I  asked. 

They  looked  at  each  other.  "It's  already 
lasted  two  years,"  they  said.

An  Amazing  Lady 


I  ONTINUED  FBOI1  PAGE  V>  | 


far-doing.  And  will  battle  for  her  friends 
against  any  odds. 

Nine  years  ago  she  came  to  Hollywood  from 
the  stage.  A  lovely  and  experienced  woman. 
And  has  been  under  contract  to  M-G-M  since 
her  coming. 

But  she  hasn't  gone  far.  And  she  knows  it. 
Because  the  people  behind  the  throne  are  her 
friends.  She's  been  with  them  through  their 
troubles  and  their  hard  times.  Naturally  she 
can't  say  I  want  that  part  or  else —  One  can't 
do  that  with  friends. 

TT  has  ruined  her  career.  The  social  game 
-1-has  been  the  death  knell  to  what  could  have 
been  a  bright  and  sparkling  career. 

''Here's  a  meaty  part, "  they'll  say.  "  Whom 
shall  we  get  for  that?'' 

"How  about  me?"  Hedda  will  suggest. 

"Oh,  good  Lord,  Hedda,  this  part  calls  for 
a  bum.  You  couldn't  be  that  woman."  Or 
they'll  scream  at  her  suggestion,  "  Good  heav- 
ens, Hedda,  she  wears  rags."  And  they  pic- 
ture Hedda  as  they  saw  her  the  night  before 
at  some  smart  party  or  as  they  see  her  night 
after  night.  In  her  Chanel  model  of  gleaming 
satin.  Her  bright  slippers.  Her  smooth  sophis- 
tication. 

And  she's  out. 

And  she  knows  it.  But  even  so,  she  prefers 
the  friends  she  has  to  the  career  she  lost. 

In  all  the  mad  scramble  for  exclusiveness, 
her  name  appears  in  the  telephone  book.  Where 
anyone,  at  any  time,  may  reach  her. 

She  drives  her  own  roadster  like  a  mad 
woman  and  collects  traffic  tickets  like  a  book 
lover  gathers  first  editions.  The  Swedish  maid 
spends  half  her  life  wringing  her  hands  in 
anguish,  waiting  for  Hedda  to  come  home.  She 
knows  as  sure  as  she's  living  that  streak  of 
lightning  that  just  passed  up  Sunset  Boulevard 
with  the  siren  screeching  after  it  is  none  other 
than  Hedda  herself.  At  least,  it  always  has 
been  so  far. 

Gracious  and  lovely,  she's  the  official  lady 
ambassador  of  Hollywood.  Sent  out  all  over 
the  state  addressing  women's  clubs  and  meet- 
ings. They  know,  this  Hollywood,  that  the 
right  thing  will  be  said  in  just  exactly  the  right 
way.  But  all  the  time  that  much  coveted 
role,  which  suited  her  down  to  the  ground,  has 
been  given  to  someone  else,  while  Hedda  is 
speechmaking  in  San  Francisco.  And  Hedda 
knows  it.    Don't  fret. 

Recently  the  Junior  Leaguers  met  at  a  con- 
vention in  Los  Angeles.  As  usual,  Hedda  was 
right  hand  lady.  At  a  luncheon  given  them 
by  the  studio  she  sat  next  to  a  very  austere 
delegate  who  gave  off  tiny  sniffs  at  the  whole 
thing.    Hedda  turned  and  looked  at  her. 

"Why,  I  know  you,"  Hedda  greeted  her. 
"We  met  at  such  and  such  a  place  three  years 
ago.  "  And  the  lady  was  so  overcome  at  Hedda 
actually  remembering,  she  thawed  out  and  ran 
in  a  torrent  of  good  will  and  fellowship  all  over 
the  meeting. 

That's  Hedda. 

A  CERTAIN  star  of  some  prominence  was 
■*»■  scheduled  to  address  a  combined  meeting 
of  cooking  classes  all  over  the  city,  recently,  and 
failed  to  appear.  The  studio  wildly  telephoned 
Hedda. 

"Good  heavens."  she  said,  "I'm  all 
ready  for  a  party."  "Hedda,"  they  begged, 
"you  must  help  us."  It  was  the  same  old  1  Lit- 
tle cry.    And,  as  usual,  she  responded. 

The  auditorium  was  packed  when  she  ar- 
rived. Calmly  she  took  her  place  on  the  plat- 
form, hunted  up  a  huge  gingham  apron,  and 
proceeded  to  give  a  lesson  on  how  to  mix  a 
special  salad  before  the  amazed  group  and  to 
chat  blithely  between  the  oil  and  vinegar. 

The  crowd  went  mad.  They  wouldn't  let 
her  go.    She  mixed  salads  and  gossiped  until 


she  was  a  salad  green  herself.  They  couldn't 
get  enough  of  her. 

But  the  star  who  failed  to  appear  was  home 
resting  for  a  test  she  made  the  next  morning. 
She  got  the  part.    Hedda  didn't.    So  you  see 

Her  friends  are  worthwhile  people.  Writers, 
directors,  men  who  think.  Recently  a  very- 
high  and  important  official  connected  with  the 
studio,  arrived  in  Los  Angeles. 

The  studio,  to  a  gagman,  was  all  dressed  up 
and  waiting.  He  didn't  appear.  Noon  came  and 
he  hadn't  shown  up.  Afternoon  and  he  was 
still  missing.  Even  Irving  Thalberg  didn't 
know  why,  or  where  he  was.  The  studio  had 
the  jitters.    No  one  could  understand  it. 

T  ATER  that  afternoon,  a  writer  from  the  stu- 
■l-'dio  passed  by  the  dining  room  of  the  Am- 
bassador Hotel  and  stopped  dead  in  his  tracks. 
There  was  Hedda  and  bless  you,  there  was  the 
official,  still  at  the  luncheon  table.  .And  he  was 
shouting  with  laughter  at  the  lady's  witty  re- 
marks. 

.After  all,  Hedda  was  Hollywood.  She  knew 
it  forwards  and  backwards.  Why  drive  around 
and  get  yourself  a  choice  sunstroke  when  here, 
wrapped  up  in  this  charming  woman,  was  the 
whole  story? 

She  says,  herself,  she'll  rush  in  where  no 
self-respecting  angel  would  tread  five  cents 
worth.  And  often  as  not  is  rebuffed.  But  no 
one  can  say  Hedda  didn't  try  to  help. 

Recently  the  grief  of  a  well-known  star  was 
brought  to  her  attention.  It  was  hinted  the 
star  was  finding  relief  in  the  too-red  beverage. 
"That  can't  be,"  Hedda  said.  "It  mustn't 
be."  And  was  off  on  that  particular  trail  like 
a  shot.  Willing  to  lay  herself  open  to  snubs  in 
order  to  help. 

Recently,  to  her  own  amazement,  she  found 
herself  playing  three  parts  at  once.  "Must  be 
this  depression  thing,"  Hedda  said  as  she  hur- 
ried from  "Speak-Easily"  to  "As  You  Desire 
Me"  and  on  to  "Skyscraper  Souls." 

Seems  fitting,  somehow,  that  at  last  Holly- 
wood's amazing  lady  should  meet  Hollywood's 
greatest  enigma,  Greta  Garbo. 

They  stood  near  each  other  on  the  set  that 
first  day  of  "As  You  Desire  Me."  No  one  in- 
troduced them.  Eor  some  reason,  no  player  is 
introduced  to  Garbo  until  after  they  have  made 
a  scene  together.  Whether  it's  just  an  old 
Swedish  custom  or  one  of  those  Nordic  things, 
no  one  knows. 

The  scene  was  called  and  they  went  through 
their  part.  Then  Hopper  came  to  know  Garbo. 
And  Garbo  to  know  Hopper.  And  even  that 
cold,  shy  exterior  of  Garbo's  was  not  immune 
from  that  comfortable  charm  of  Hedda.  Like  the 
sniffing  delegate  at  the  luncheon,  she  melted. 

It  was  a  few  days  after  the  picture  started 
that  Garbo  came  onto  the  set  in  a  pair  of  men's 
gray  woolen  socks  and  huge  floppy  sandals. 

"For  heaven's  sake,"  Hedda  said,  "look  at 
your  feet. " 

Garbo  looked  down  at  her  feet  in  wonder. 

"And  only  yesterday  I  knocked  a  newspaper 
man  down  because  he  said  you  had  big  feet. 
I  said  you  hadn't  because  I'd  tried  on  your 
slippers  and  they  were  the  same  size  as  mine. 
And  now  look  at  you. " 

GARBO  looked  at  her  with  open   mouth. 
"Ooo,  ooo,"  she  said  and  threw  back  her 
head  and  howled  with  laughter,  "you  knock  a 
'  man  down.    That's  the  funniest  thing  I  ever 
heard. " 

She  wasn't  at  all  concerned  about  the  big 
feet.    That  Hedda,  the  last  word  in  her  - 
frock,  her  tip-tilted  hat  from  Paris,  her  dainty 
gloves,  should  even  attempt  to  knock  down  a 
man  was  too  much  for  Greta. 

Each  day  as  she  came  on  the  set  she  called, 
"Hedda,  tell  me  about  the  man  you  knock 
down."

Friendship  grew.  Shy,  faltering  little  con- 
fidences that  Garbo  knew  hadn't  and  never 
would  be  told,  were  given.  A  friend,  not 
anxious  to  capitalize  on  that  friendship,  was 
a  new  experience. 

And  then  came  the  last  day  of  the  picture. 
They  stood  at  the  door  of  the  stage.  A  firm 
hand  clasped  a  firmer  one. 

Shy,  strange  gray  eyes  looked  into  twin- 
kling, warm,  gray  eyes. 

The  inevitable  had  happened. 

Hollywood's  greatest  and  strangest  of  wom- 
en, Greta  Garbo,  had  met  Hollywood's  amaz- 
ing and  frankest  of  women. 

And  Hedda's  old  charm  had  worked  again 

As  lasting  friends — they  parted. 


Did  you  ever  see  anything  that  fits  the 
description  "demure"  more  perfectly 
than  this  dinner  gown  of  Helen  Hayes? 
Helen  has  a  Victorian  apartment  in 
New  York  and  we  think  she  must 
have  bought  this  especially  to  wear  in 
it.  The  high  waist  and  little  black 
lace  guimpe  have  a  flavor  of  the 
"mauve  decade."  Incidentally,  this 
is  a  new  type  of  evening  costume 
which  promises  to  have  a  big  vogue

Hollywood  Keeps  Fashion  Wires 
Humming  With  New  Ideas 

By   Seymour 


KEEPING  up  with  Hollywood  fashion- 
ably has  been  a  man's  size  job  these  past 
few  weeks!  Everybody,  of  course,  did 
the  Olympics  and  although  summer  oflicially 
still  prevailed,  all  the  real  fashion  forecasters 
of  the  cinema  colony  decked  themselves  out  in 
new  raiment. 

At  one  event,  Mrs.  Clark  Gable  looked 
radiant  in  a  smart  frock  of  rose  ostrich  tweed. 
With  this  she  wore  a  matching  fabric  turban 
and  a  scarf  of  silver  fox. 

Lily  Damita,  with  characteristic  French  chic, 
sponsored  the  favorite  Hollywood  vogue — a 
mannish  tailored  woolen  suit.  Her  suit  was  dis- 
tinguished by  unusually  wide  lapels  on  the 
jacket.  She.  too,  wore  a  fabric  hat  to  match. 
This  fabric  hat  idea  is  becoming  a  greater  fad 
every  day — they  are  so  practical  and  wearable. 
At  the  Fairbanks  dinner  for  some  of  the 
Olympic  guests,  Corinne  Griffith,  who  has 
recently  returned  from  great  social  successes  in 
England,  wore  a  striking  color  scheme.  Her 
frock  was  a  deep  red  and  her  coat  a  rich  purple 
shade.  It  sounds  wild  but,  actually,  it  was 
knockout.  Purple  in  several  tones  is  decidedly 
on  the  up  and  up  for  the  new  season. 

GOLDEX  yellow  is  a  new  color  for  furs. 
Jean  Harlow  started  things  when  she  ap- 
peared at  a  recent  opening  wearing  a  white 
broadtail  coat  trimmed  with  a  lavish  collar  of 
natural  sable.  Sables  in  their  natural  skins  are 
yellow ! 

And  Madge  Evans  wears  a  scarf  of  canary 
yellow  martin  in  her  new  picture.  This  scarf, 
fashioned  of  six  skins,  has  another  unique 
twist — one  of  the  skins  is  caught  about  the 
\Trist.  You  may  have  to  see  the  picture  to  get 
the  idea— but  you'll  like  it. 


Recent  evening  affairs  have  brought  all  the 
picture  darlings  out  in  full  force — most  of  them 
have  gone  "demure"  in  dress.  Really  they 
look  like  pictures  of  the  Victorian  era — it's 
very  attractive,  I  might  add.  Karen  Morley, 
for  instance,  wears  a  vivid  coral  colored  jacket 
that  has  tremendous  leg  o'  mutton  sleeves. 
These  are  fitted  from  elbow  to  wrist  with  the 
flare  at  the  shoulders.  She  recently  wore  this 
over  a  white  ruffled  frock. 

/^\STRICH  feathers  are  flying  around  again ! 
^•-^Ruth  Roland,  who  is  now  one  of  our  smart 
matrons,  wears  a  blue  velvet  cape  edged  with 
ostrich  in  the  same  shade. 

Maybe  you  will  be  wearing  velvet  gloves 
this  winter.  They  are  the  latest  foible  for 
formal  costumes — they  should  be  very  popular 
with  everyone. 

Muffs  of  all  kinds  are  joining  the  ranks  of 
revivals.  Fur  ones  will  be  seen  this  winter,  and 
right  now  Ina  Claire,  who  never  misses  a 
fashion  trick,  is  carrying  a  little  pink  one  to 
match  a  pink  evening  frock. 

A  T  the  famous  "  Strange  Interlude"  open- 
-'Mng,  one  young  thing  wore  a  new  style  in 
hair  ornaments.  It  was  a  jeweled  round  comb 
worn  across  her  head  in  typical  "Alice  in 
Wonderland"  manner.  Very  cute  and  a  good 
note  to  jot  down  in  your  coiffure  notebook. 

Greta  Garbo  made  quite  a  sensation  when 
she  appeared  at  lunch  on  shipboard  in  a 
bifurcated  skirt  slit  up  both  legs  to  show  shorts 
beneath.  Greta  on  her  homeward  bound  trip 
appeared  every  day  in  some  form  of  trousers. 
And  Pola  Negri  may  start  a  new  fad  at 
Malibu  because  she  wear^  gloves  with  her 
beach  pajamas! 


It's  The  Wav  He  Savs  It 


CONTINUED  FROM  PAUL  60 


"  L-listen.'"  a  quiet  voice  inquired,  "has  any- 
body here — ?  " 

That  was  as  far  as  he  got. 

"Out,"  shrieked  the  director  dramatically, 
"get  him  out.  My  God,  I  can't  be  mad  with 
that  man  around.  I  won't  have  it.  This  is  my 
time  to  be  mad  and  I  am  going  to  be  mad.  Do 
you  hear?" 

"  But — oh  say,  wait.  I — that  is — "  Stu 
tried  to  explain. 

The  director  stopped  dead  in  his  feverish 
pacing  and  listened.  Suddenly  he  sat  down  on 
a  prop  couch  and  shook.  Wiping  three  and  a 
half  pints  of  flowing  tears  from  his  cheeks. 

"Mind,"  he  yelled  between  gulps  of  laugh- 
ter. "I'm  still  mad.  Only  there  is  something 
about  this  fellow  that  makes  me  laugh.  What 
is  so  funny  about  him^''  he  laughed  and  cried 
at  the  same  time.  "Why  am  I  laughing  when 
I  should  be  mad?    Who  knows  that?" 

Certainly  Stu  didn't. 

Coming  in  froi-i  location  after  a  hard  day's 
work  on  his  new  starring  picture,  "  Make  Me  A 
Star,"  the  thoughts  of  his  comfortable  home, 
his  beautiful  wife.  June  Collyer.  and  a  warm 
dinner  awaiting  him.  urged  Stu  to  step  on  it. 
He  stepped. 

Suddenly  the  sounds  of  the  old  familiar  siren 
reached  his  ear  and  the  next  moment  a  motor- 
cycle cop  waved  him  over  to  the  side  of  the 
road. 


The 


It  was  rather  dark  and  drizzling  rain, 
cop  was  sore. 

"I  guess  I  was  going  a  little  too  fast,"  Stu 
explained.  "I — you  see,"  the  old  caress  was 
working  overtime,  "I  was  anxious  to  get  home. 
I—" 

The  cop  paused.  Pencil  in  hand.  "Oh.  you 
were,  were  you?  *'  the  edge  gone  from  his  voice. 

"  Yes.  you  see — "  Stu  went  on  explaining.  A 
slow  twinkle  grew  in  the  eyes  of  the  cop.  The 
pencil  dropped. 

Fifteen  minutes  later  a  hard-boiled  cop  and 
Stu  sat  over  a  steaming  cup  of  coffee  in  a  little 
wayside  inn.  slapping  each  other  on  the  back 
over  the  one  about  the  Irishman  and  Abie. 
Having  a  swell  time. 

AND  a  little  later,  when  Stu  drove  away,  a 
bewildered  cop  suddenly  came  to  and  won- 
dered what  the  heck  had  gotten  into  him. 
Must  be  a  little  bilious,  he  decided,  or  maybe  it 
was  the  weather. 

Stuart  Erwin  was  born  on  St.  Valentine's 
day.  And  the  obvious  wisecracks  had  him  up 
many  a  time  in  the  middle  of  the  night  peeping 
anxiously  in  the  mirror.  Could  he  look  that 
funny? 

And  the  fact  that  he  was  born  in  Squaw 
Valley.  Calif.,  didn't  mean  he  was  any  relation 
to  a  papoose,  either.  But  the  fact  that  he 
decided  to  be  an  actor  and  walked  out  on  the 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  October,  1932 


I  I  I 


University  of  California  to  be  one  didn't 
exactly  mean  he'd  be  a  movie  star  in  Holly- 
wood, either.    But  he  is. 

He  went  to  Los  Angeles  and  obtained  a  part 
in  a  show.  And  what  a  part  that  was.  He  was 
an  Irishman,  a  Jew,  a  negro,  a  straight  lead  and 
a  bearded  gentleman  all  in  one  show.  As  a 
matter  of  fact,  he  was  three  of  them  in  the 
second  act  alone.  And  half  the  time  played  an 
Irishman  with  an  "Old  Black  Joe"  accent,  but 
the  people  laughed  no  matter  what  he  said.  So 
Stu  was  set. 

Then  on  to  "White  Collars," and  finally  with 
Edward  Everett  Horton  on  the  stage  in  Hol- 
lywood. 

He  even  tried  movies.  But  the  movies 
hadn't  learned  to  talk  yet  and  Stu  was  just 
another  actor. 

AND  then  came  sound,  and  Stu  Erwin  in 
"Sweetie."  It  slayed  them.  In  New  York  a 
beautiful,  brown-eyed  girl  with  a  dimple  sat  in 
the  fourth  row  and  laughed  till  she  cried.  "  But, 
of  course,"  June  Collyer  said,  "I  didn't  know 
Stu  then." 

Several  years  later  on  the  Paramount  lot,  he 
came  onto  the  set  of  "Dude  Ranch,"  dead 
tired.  He  had  worked  all  night  on  the  back  lot. 
There  is  about  him  a  wistfulness  and  appeal 
that  is  felt  by  everyone.  June  Collyer  felt  it. 
"  There  was  something  in  Stu's  voice  that  day," 
June  said,  "I  don't  know  what  it  was."  But 
suddenly  they  were  in  love.  And  one  day  they 
decided  to  elope.    To  Yuma. 

Anxious  not  to  have  their  marriage  known, 
June's  two  brothers  went  along  and  stood  be- 
tween them  and  the  usual  crowd  about  a  court 
house.  Everything  was  quickly  and  quietly 
done. 

They  stood  before  the  judge.  And  then  a 
familiar  voice  saying  "I  do,"  and  four  stenog- 
raphers jumped  six  feet  in  the  air  and  the  office 
boy  upset  ten  bottles  of  ink.  Even  the  judge 
looked  up  over  his  glasses  and  said, 
"Burrrrrrmph." 

"That's  Stu  Erwin,"  a  wide-eyed  office  force 
announced.  "I'd  know  that  voice  anywhere." 
And  immediately  all  secrecy  was  off. 

During  the  making  of  "Playboy  of  Paris," 
Stu's  big  scene  came,  when  Maurice  Chevalier 
shot  the  plate  over  his  head.  Stu  was  to  turn 
and  just  look  at  the  plate.  It  should  have  been 
funny  but  it  wasn't.  They  shot  it  again  and 
again. 

"  What's  the  matter  with  it?"  the  director 
fumed.    "Something's  wrong." 

They  tried  it  again.  Stu  turned,  looked  at 
the  plate  and  then  added  a  soft,  little 
"  Oooooooooo." 

It  worked.  Just  that  one  word  in  Stu's 
own  little  way  and  that  scene  set  more  people 
to  howling  outright  than  any  scene  in  a  long 
time. 

Behind  that  calm,  stoical  face  lies  a  quick, 
active  mind.  Stu  Erwin  doesn't  run  to  wise- 
cracks. He's  not  a  wit.  But  he  has  a  sense  of 
humor  that's  almost  as  priceless  as  his  voice. 
"What's  funny?"  Fredric  March  and  George 
Barbier  used  to  ask  him  on  the  "Strangers  in 
Love"  set.  And  when  Stu  was  through  telling 
it,  although  they  had  seen  the  same  thing 
themselves,  they  were  convulsed.  They  hadn't 
noticed  it  being  funny.  But  leave  it  to  that 
Erwin  lad. 

\  /f  EN  like  working  with  him.  He  is  unselfish 
^■Mn  every  way  and  can  think  up  more 
monkey  business  than  a  director  can  shoot. 

"Strangers  in  Love"  was  being  previewed. 
Paramount  executives,  directors  and  actors  in 
droves  were  present. '  As  each  actor  appeared 
on  the  screen,  he  was  applauded  by  the  audi- 
ence. 

And  then  suddenly  came  a  voice.  Before 
the  actor  was  seen.  The  audience,  as  one,  went 
wild.  Just  a  few  spoken  words  and  they  yelled 
themselves  hoarse.  They  had  recognized  the 
Erwin  twang. 

The  next  day  there  was  a  hurried  meeting  of 
Paramount  executives.  And  there  it  was  de- 
cided. Stu  Erwin's  voice  was  to  be  starred. 
With  Stu,  of  course.

follow  Kay's  career  with  joy,  as  she  forges  for- 
ward in  fame  and  fortune.  Warners  buy  her 
away  from  Paramount — her  name  flashes  in 
lights  on  a  thousand  H  roadways — her  parts  and 
ink  account  swell  handsomely.  I'm  very 
happy,  as  I  think  of  that  serious,  beautiful  girl 
who  lias  blasted  a  great  career  out  of  a  rocky 
new  world. 

And  I  don't  clap  an  eye  on  her,  in  the  flesh, 
for  three  years. 

TT'S  the  summer  of  1932.  Through  a  New 
■Mfork  that  is  pulling  and  perspiring,  Hall — 
older,  grayer  and  crazier — is  still  on  the  prowl. 

I  slink  into  the  Hotel  Flysee — a  small  side- 
street  tavern  that  is  a  favorite  Gotham  hide- 
away of  picture  people — and  am  announced 
to  -Miss  Kay  Francis,  there  stopping  on  a  brief 
parole  from  the  slave-galleys  of  the  film  colony. 

I  punch  the  doorbell  of  her  suite.  The  door 
is  opened  by  Kay's  delightful  husband,  Ken- 
neth MacKenna — himself  an  actor  of  tremen- 
dous charm  and  horse-power. 

And  here's  Kay,  the  star — smiling  a  welcome, 
hand  outstretched. 

I  take  it  with  vim,  and  appraise  the  situa- 
tion. 

And  I  think  of  the  lonely  girl  trying  to  catch 
a  spot  of  rest  in  the  new  world  of  1929. 

The  doorbell  is  ringing  like  a  xylophone — 
callers,  cracked  ice,  packages  and  pals.  Mac- 
Kenna leaps  from  phone  to  door  with  all  the 
agility  of  an  adagio  dancer,  while  Kay  holds 
court. 

Mr.  Clifton  Webb,  the  noted  dancing  come- 
dian, tail-coat  type,  is  sitting  on  a  sofa  talking 
fourteen  to  the  dozen.  A  girl  friend  of  New 
York  days,  with  whom  Kay  has  just  had  an 
enthusiastic  reunion,  is  pushing  Webb  closely 
for  first  place. 

Celery  tonic — this  time  in  a  pitcher  fre- 
quently replenished  by  MacKenna — plashes 
about.  The  room  is  a  bedlam  of  bells,  conver- 
sation and  cries  of  "'Sly  DEAR!'' 

Kay,  it  appears,  has  acquired  a  tough  case 
of  "rheumatic  sore  throat-' — a  new  trick  to 
me,  and  certainly  one  not  coveted  by  a  picture 
star  whose  living  depends  on  her  talk-box. 

She  and  Webb  discuss  it. 

"It  started  in  my  pharynx,"  she  says,  "and 
then  it  got  into  the  larynx. " 

"  My  dear,  "  says  Webb,  "  I  know.  I've  had 
it.  You're  lucky  if  it  doesn't  get  into  your 
trachea!" 

"It's  quite  a  bother." 

"It's  all  caused  by  acidity,"  offers  Webb. 
"You  mustn't  eat  any  red  meat." 

"All  she  eats  is  red  meat,"  remarks  Mac- 
Kenna, between  phone  calls. 

"  Why  don't  you  all  come  swimming?"  sug- 
gests an  unidentified  man  who  has  been  looking 
for  an  opening. 

"Sorry,  we  can't,"  says  Kay.  "A  lot  of 
friends  are  coming  in  for  dinner.  And  besides 
— my  throat. " 

AND  so  it  goes.  I  sit  quietly  in  my  corner, 
feeling  as  though  I  were  in  the  middle  of  a 
Kansas  twister,  and  going  up  in  the  air  with 
the  hencoops  and  silos. 

"  I  liked  that  piece  you  wrote  about  me  three 
years  ago,"  says  Kay  to  me: 

"I'm  glad  you  did,"  says  I.  "It  was  a 
pleasure  to  see  you. " 

"Do  you  want  to  go  into  the  other  room 
and  talk  a  few  minutes?  " 

"  No,"  says  I,  "let's  just  sit  here.  I'm  get- 
ting a  good  story  this  way.  " 

She  looks  at  me  quizzically,  wondering  what 
is  going  on  inside  my  thick  skull. 

Finally  I  rise  to  go. 

"Goodbye,  Kaj — thanks  for  the  visit,"  I 
say.    "  And  take  care  of  the  throat. " 

"Goodbye,"  she  answers.  The  rest  of  the 
crowd  chatters  on.    A  word  of  ta-ta  to  Mac-

der of  small  talk,  dotted  with  ringing  bells. 

Kay  Francis,  1932  model.  Still  lovely,  much 
more  sure  of  herself,  still  with  wide,  frank  eyes 
— and  with  the  shining  veneer  of  hardness  with 
which  Hollywood  coats  its  hectic,  successful 
children. 

"L_TEIGHO — Kay's  a  star  now.  She  lives  in 
-*■  -*-the  midst  of  madness,  which  is  one  of  the 
wages  of  fame  and  fortune. 

As  I  go  down  in  the  elevator  and  sneak  past 
the  supercilious  doorman  into  the  sweltering 
street,  I  wonder  how  she  feels  about  it  all. 

And  can  you  understand  why  my  mind  did 
a  running  broad  jump  over  three  long  years — 
to  a  lonely,  vivid  and  very  beautiful  girl,  am- 
bitious and  determined,  fighting  her  way  for- 
ward in  a  strange  new  land? 

It  seems  to  me  that  in  these  two  little  pic- 
tures I've  tried  to  draw  will  be  found  all  the 
laughter,  cheers  and  tears  that  the  life  of  film- 
dom  holds!

thousands  5  to  15  lbs.  in  a  few  weeks. 


IF  YOU  want  to  round  out  unattractive  hollows 
with  firm,  healthy  flesh — here's  wonderful  news! 

For  years  doctors  have  prescribed  beer 
to  put  flesh  on  thin,  run-down  men  and 
women.  But  now  scientists  have  per- 
fected a  new  formula  which  not  only 
builds  even  firmer,  healthier  flesh  than 
beer — but  which  brings  this  marvelous 
result  in  half  the  time!  And  brings  other 
benefits,  too.  A  clear,  glowing  skin — 
easy  digestion — new  vital  energy! 

Concentrated  beer  yeast 

Ironized  Yeast,  as  these  pleasant-tasting 
tablets  are  called,  contains  specially  cul- 
tured, imported  beer  yeast — the  richest 
yeast  ever  known — which  through  a  new 
process  has  been  concentrated  7  times — 
made  y  times  more  powerful. 

This  super-rich  yeast  is  scientifically 
ironized — treated  with  three  distinct 
kinds  of  energizing  iron.  This  tonic  ele- 
ment strengthens  and  enriches  the 
blood,  enabling  it  to  carry  all  the  health- 
building  yeast  to  the  worn-out  tissues. 

A  new  figure  quick! 

Like  thousands  of  others  you'll  be  amazed 
and  delighted  to  see  how  quickly  you  gain

Photoplay  Magazine  for  October,  1932 

Screen    Memories    From    Photoplay 


The  swashbuckling, 
sword-rattling  Douglas 
Fairbanks  of  ten  years 
ago,    as     Robin    Hood 


15  Years  Ago 

TN  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  United  States  was 
-*-at  war  and  dozens  of  the  greatest  screen 
heroes  of  the  time  were  being  drafted,  the 
movies  were  carrying  on,  trying  to  make  a  sad- 
dened people  forget.  To  keep  up  a  gay  spirit, 
we  gave  Douglas  Fairbanks  a  four-page  inter- 
view, all  done  with  pictures,  in  which  the  re- 
doubtable Doug  showed  readers  of  fifteen 
years  ago  how  to  do  those  stunts  that  made 
him  famous.  He  was  as  agile  as  a  mountain 
goat,  but  no  more  agile  than  he  is  right  now, 
for  the  Doug  of  today  still  practises  gymnastics 
and  still  takes  his  vigorous  exercises.  Lots  of 
men  half  his  age  can't  keep  up  with  him. 

As  a  matter  of  fact,  it  was  a  pretty  active 
month.  Norma  Talmadge  was  snapped  in  her 
backyard  garden,  swinging  a  mean  hoe. 

Maybe  you  thought  that  this  business  of 
Ethel  Barrymore's  having  consented  to  grace 
the  movies  with  her  presence  was  something 
new,  but  fifteen  years  ago  Ethel  was  busily 
engaged  in  picture  making.  And  who — guess 
quickly — was  directing  her?  None  other  than 
brother  Lionel.  How  were  we  to  know  that 
years  later  all  three  Barrymores  were  to  be 
playing  together?  And  although  Lionel  is 
merely  acting  in  the  film,  Ethel  asks  his  advice 
before  she  does  a  single  scene. 

And  here's  an  interview  with  Alice  Joyce  and 
her  tiny  baby  daughter.  Now  a  young  lady, 
little  Alice  is  in  Hollywood  with  her  mother — 
looking  over  the  cinema  city. 

Alice  Joyce  was  the  girl  on  the  cover,  while 
Billie  Burke,  Alice  Brady,  Elsie  Ferguson  and 
Pauline  Frederick  graced  the  gallery. 

In  the  Shadow  Stage  department  we  looked 
back  over  the  past  twelve  months  and  pointed 
out  that  some  of  the  year's  best  acting  had 
been  done  by  Gladys  Brockwell,  Sessue  Haya- 
kawa,  Dorothy  Phillips  and  Pauline  Frederick, 
whom  our  reviewer  called  "potentially  the 
greatest  dramatic  actress  on  the  screen." 

Cal  York  items:  Texas  Guinan  has  been  per- 
suaded to  act  in  the  movies.  .  .  .  D.  W. 
Griffith  has  completed  one  of  his  war  pictures 
made  on  the  battlefields  of  Europe  and  is  now 
working  on  a  second. 


10  Years  Ago 

"COR  years  and  years  we've  been  telling  girls 
•*-  all  over  the  country  how  hard  it  is  for  an 
extra  to  climb  the  ladder  of  success.  On  the 
pages  of  Photoplay  of  ten  years  ago  is  a  neat 
and  pertinent  lesson.  We  picked  out  nine 
extra  girls — the  prettiest  and  loveliest  of  the 
horde — and  printed  their  pictures.  Not  one  of 
those  girls  rose  to  stardom!  In  fact  two  are 
still  extras  today! 

There  was  a  cute  story  about  Buster 
Keaton's  baby — Joseph  Talmadge  Keaton. 
What  a  happy  family  group  they  made  then — 
mama  Natalie  Talmadge,  papa  Buster  and 
baby  Joe.  The  family  group  is  happy  no 
longer,  for  Buster  and  Natalie  have  told  their 
troubles  to  a  judge. 

By  far  the  biggest  news  of  the  month  was  the 
marriage  of  Jack  Pickford  and  Marilyn  Miller 
and  we  described  Mary  Pickford  as  matron  of 
honor  and  Doug  Fairbanks  as  master  of  cere- 
monies. We  couldn't  know  that  that  marriage 
was  to  end  in  divorce,  no  more  than  we  could 
know  when  we  first  told  of  the  idyllic  love  of 
William  S.  Hart  and  Winifred  Westover  that 
just  eight  months  after  their  marriage  they 
would  part. 

Alice  Brady  was  the  girl  on  the  cover  while 
inside  in  the  gallery  were  Madge  Bellamy, 
Billie  Dove,  Pauline  Starke,  Charles  Ray,  Percy 
Marmont,  Lois  Wilson,  and  May  McAvoy. 

The  six  best  pictures  were  "Blood  and 
Sand,"  "The  Masquerader,"  "Fools  First," 
"Nice  People,"  "The  Eternal  Flame,"  and 
"Her  Gilded  Cage." 

Cal  York  items:  By  the  time  he  is  eight 
years  old  this  fall,  Jackie  Coogan  will  have 
earned  a  million  dollars.  .  .  .  Betty  Compson 
is  going  places  with  Walter  Morosco  (wonder 
if  either  one  remembers  that  romance  now?). 

5  Years  Ago 

'"PHE  most  striking  news  of  the  month  five 
-*-  years  ago  was  Norma  Shearer's  announce- 
ment that  she  would  marry  Irving  Thalberg 
after  all  and  that  the  things  she  said  about 
marriage  and  a  career  not  jibing  were  just  so 
much  nonsense.  That's  one  marriage  that  has 
weathered  the  storm.  Norma  is  still  Mrs. 
Thalberg — wife,  mother  and  successful  actress. 

We  don't  want  to  pat  ourselves  on  the  back 
too  much,  but  under  a  lovely  photograph  of 
Claudette  Colbert  we  made  the  prophecy  that 
the  public  was  going  to  see  a  lot  of  the  girl.  She 
had  just  been  signed  for  her  first  movie  role. 
The  next  few  years  were  to  shoot  Claudette  to 
success.  Then  mediocre  roles  were  to  keep  her 
career  at  a  standstill.  But  it's  going  to  be 
different  from  now  on.  Claudette  recently 
begged  for  and  got  the  role  of  the  bad  girl  in 
"The  Sign  of  the  Cross"  and  is  doing  one  swell 
job. 

A  story  introducing  a  new  boy  named  Buddy 
Rogers.  He  was  Mary  Pickford's  leading  man 
in  "My  Best  Girl. "  He  did  not  know  that  the 
five  years  that  lay  before  him  were  to  make 
him  a  movie  idol,  and  then  his  light  as  a  star 
was  to  go  out  and  Buddy  was  to  retire  from  the 
movies.  But  he  still  can  make  a  nice  living, 
thank  you,  crooning  songs  over  the  radio  and 
being  the  boss  man  for  a  New  York  orchestra. 

Lovely  Dolores  Costello  graced  the  cover, 
while  the  gallery  pictures  included  Greta 
Garbo,  Jobyna  Ralston,  Dick  Arlen,  Dorothy 
Dwan,  William  Haines  and  Harold  Lloyd. 

The  six  best  pictures  were  "Quality  Street," 
"  Mockery,"  "Hard-Boiled  Haggerty,"  "Shang- 
hai Bound,"  "Hula"  and  "Swim,  Girl, 
Swim." 

Cal  York  items:  Emil  Jannings  and 
Wallace  Beery  are  the  two  best  Hollywood 
pals.  .  .  .  Claire  Windsor  and  Bert  Lytell  have 
called  it  quits.

NON-SMARTING 

TEAR-PROOF 

MAYBELLINE 

Brilliant  eyes  that  mirror  the 
emotions — eyes  that  glow  when  the 
heart  sings — eyes  that  speak  when 
words  would  fail  to  convey  the 
fullest  meaning.  Yes,  alluring  eyes — 
the  kind  that  make  Thelma  Todd 
and  other  stars  of  the  screen  popu- 
lar with  millions.  You  can  have 
them.  And  instantly! 
Just  a  touch  of  the  New  May- 
belline to  your  lashes  and  the  magic 
transformation  takes  place.  As  your 
lashes  are  made  to  appear  dark,  long 
and  luxuriant,  your  eyes  become 
more  brilliant,  and  wonderfully 
expressive.  Interesting?  Inviting? 
Bewitching,  to  say  the  least! 
But — be  sure  you  get  the  genuine 
New  Maybelline  because  it  is 
harmless,  non-smarting  and  ideally 
tear-proof.  The  New  Maybelline,

What  makes  men 
fall  for  BLONDES? 

TESTS  show  that  men  fall  in  love  with  blondes 
much  more  easily  than  with  brunettes.  How- 
ever, when  blonde  hair  fades  or  becomes  dull 
and  lifeless,  a  blonde  becomes  less  attractive. 
By  using  BLONDEX,  amazing  special  shampoo, 
the  original  golden,  sparkling  radiance  of  youth 
is  restored  and  faded  blonde  hair  becomes  a 
shimmering  cascade  of  golden  loveliness.  No 
ilye,  no  harmful  chemicals — marvelously  benefi- 
cial  to  both  hair  and  scalp.  Try  it  today!  See 
the  astonishing  beauty  it  will  give  you  in  tin 
minutrs!  Ask  for  Blondes  at  any  Drug  or 
Department  store. 


Short   Subjects 
of  the  Month 


Franklin  Pangborn  tries  his  best  to  be  tough  in  "What  Price 
Taxi,"  and  then  a  real  tough  guy,  Bud  Jamieson,  appears 
on  the  scene.    What  follows  is  a  riot.     Reviewed  below 


TT77,ir  PRICE  TAXI 
Hal  Roach-M-C-M 

This  one  is  really  funny  and  the  gags  are 
great.  Clyde  Cook  and  Franklin  Pangborn,  as 
a  couple  of  taxi  drivers  baffled  by  life  and  love, 
are  a  howl.  And  when  they  become  involved 
with  a  tough  lad's  wife,  you'll  have  your  share 
of  good  laughs. 

JITTERS,  THE  BUTLER 
RKO-Radio 

F.ven  the  title  is  funny.  And  when  Clark 
and  McCullough,  who  have  a  brand  of  humor 
with  their  own  trade-mark  on  it,  start  clown- 
ing, you'll  forget  you  ever  had  a  trouble.  The 
story  doesnt  matter — it's  ail  sheer  nonsense, 
anyhow. 

DESERT  TRIPOLI 
Fox 

Here's  one  of  the  "Magic  Carpet  Series'' 
that  you  can't  afford  to  miss.  And  take  the 
kids  along  for  they'll  learn  more  about  Tripoli 
in  those  few  minutes  than  they  could  in  hours 
with  their  geography  books.  Besides  its  educa- 
tional value,  this  travelogue  is  beautifully 
photographed  and  entertaining. 

THE  HOLLYWOOD  HANDICAP 
Universal 

Xot  a  hilarious  comedy,  but  you'll  get  your 
share  of  excitement.  It  concerns  an  actor  and 
his  movie  double  who  settle  a  wager.  Don 
Alvarado  is  the  good  looking  leading  man. 

FURY  OF  THE  STORM 
Educational-Lyman  U.  II one 

You  won't  start  a  back-to-thc-ranch  move- 
ment after  seeing  this  chilling  bit  of  photog- 
raphy. The  camera  takes  you  through  a 
blizzard  on  a  Western  ranch.  Sheep  and  cattle 
plunge  about  in  drifts  while  cowboys  ride 
through  the  blinding  storm. 


THE  GOLF  CHAMP 

RKO-Radio 

Xobody  who  ever  walked  around  a  golf 
course  or  had  an  in-law  (and  haven't  we  all?) 
should  miss  this  amusing  short.  It's  one  of  the 
"Mr.  Average  Man"  series  and  Edgar  Kennedy 
is  great. 

CRADLES  OF  CREED 

M-G-M 

One  of  the  most  unusual  shorts  ever  made, 
this  explains  the  rive  great  creeds  of  the  world 
— beginning  with  the  Hindu  and  marching  to 
Christianity — in  a  brief,  simple  maimer  under- 
standable to  all. 

YOUNG  OXIOXS 

Educational-Mack  Scnnctt 

Xot  as  funny  as  the  usual  Sennett  offerings 
but  it  has  enough  gags  to  make  it  entertaining. 
Forrester  Harvey  and  Dorothy  Granger  decide 
to  get  out  of  a  five-years-married  rut.  You  can 
imagine  the  rest. 

BOSKO  AT  THE  BEACH 

Vitaphone 

If  you  like  the  brisk  antics  of  that  clever 
little  animated  cartoon  fellow,  Bosko,  you'll 
enjoy  this  reel  which  shows  him  picnicking  at 
the  beach  with  his  girl.  It  has  good  singing  and 
dialogue,  too. 

IF  I'M  ELECTED 

Vitaphone 

This  one  registers  because  of  its  political 
timeliness.  Although  lots  of  the  gags  are  old, 
you'll  get  a  chuckle  or  two  out  of  the  absurdi- 
ties of  its  broad  burlesque. 

WHO,  ME? 

Universal 

A  tangled  yam  about  a  newly  married  couple 
who  want  to  keep  their  wedding  a  secret.  Xot 
enough  laughs.

Come  On — Let's  Watch  'Em  Eat! 

I  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  51  ] 


Two  tomato  slices  fried  in  butter.  French 
fried  potatoes,  lettuce  leaves  and  olives.  Put 
them  all  together  and  they  certainly  don't 
spell  MOTHER  but  they  do  make  a  "Jackie 
Cooper  Sandwich."  So  named  because  Jackie 
himself  invented  it.  And  ice  cream?  I  tell 
you — 

But  let's  go  on.  Mae  Clarke  eats  cheese  and 
crackers  for  breakfast  and  Doug  Fairbanks, 
Jr.,  orders  potatoes  au  gratin  so  often  that 
Joan's  face  is  that  red. 

CLARK  GABLE  is  the  least  food  conscious 
person  on  the  M-G-M  lot.  Dinner  is  the  big 
meal  for  Clark,  but  once  in  a  while  for  luncheon 
he'll  order  his  favorite  sandwich  (if  he's  work- 
ing hard)  that  rivals  the  Empire  State  Build- 
ing (tower  included)  for  dizzy  heights. 

It's  a  double-double  decker  including  bacon, 
Swiss  cheese,  roast  beef  and  minced  eggs. 

And  it's  Clark  (heavy  lover)  Gable  who 
carries  pockets  and  pockets  full  of  peanuts. 
They  keep  track  of  Clark  on  the  M-G-M  lot 
simply  by  tracing  the  peanut  shells. 

And  if  you  imagine  Paul  Lukas,  that  hand- 
some Hungarian  over  at  Paramount,  must 
have  his  goulash,  you're  wrong.  All  wrong. 
Ham  and  eggs.  Fried  chicken.  Steaks  and 
three  cheers  for  the  red,  white  and  blue,  Paul 
loves  pancakes,   too. 

When  Hungarian  guests  gather  at  Paul's 
home,  a  special  Hungarian  cook  is  hired  to 
cook  the  meal  while  Paul's  own  cook  prepares 
for  him  good  old  American  steak  and  onions. 

Paul's  going  to  get  rid  of  that  accent  if  he 
has  to  eat  pancakes  to  do  it. 

Stand  back.  Hats  off.  Garbo's  tray  is 
passing  by.  Mysterious  as  the  Swedish  siren 
herself,  is  Garbo's  daily  tray,  secretly  prepared 
in  the  M-G-M  kitchen.  But  leave  it  to  your 
old  auntie  to  snoop  around  and  get  beneath 
that  napkin  cover.  And  there  it  is.  A  rye 
bread  sandwich.  Always.  Rain  or  shine, 
"Grand  Hotel"  or  "As  You  Desire  Me,"  it's 
a  rye  bread  sandwich.  Black  tea  or  black 
coffee  to  drink  and  in  that  mysterious  waxed 
paper  package — a  monstrous  slice  of  Swiss 
cheese.  As  sure  as  the  moon  comes  over  the 
mountains,  the  Swiss  cheese  goes  over  to 
Garbo.  Ah,  sweet  mysteries  of  life,  alas  I 
found.  Garbo  never  goes  to  the  studio  lunch- 
room any  more.  The  tray  is  sent  to  her 
dressing-room. 

Marie  Dressier,  bless  her  heart,  nibbles  like 
a  gold  fish.  But  no  matter  how  little  she  has, 
it  must  be  good.  And  always  is.  You  should 
know  Mamie,  Marie's  cook.  Honey  chile, 
would  you  love  Mamie!  Fried  chicken. 
Light  fluffy  biscuit.  And  all  Marie's  friends 
rally  round  and  Marie  enjoys  watching  the 
results.  Miss  Dressier  has  some  of  the  finest 
recipes  in  existence,  having  collected  them 
from  all  over  the  world. 

But  Polly  Moran.  Weep  no  more  my  lady. 
Monday  at  the  M-G-M  commissary  at  twelve, 
enters  Polly.  In  make-up.  "One  glass  of 
grapefruit  juice,  please."  And  Polly's  gone. 
"Dear  me,"  the  tourists  from  Kansas  murmur, 
"what  a  light  eater." 

/^OMES  Tuesday.  Same  place.  Same  time. 
^--'Enters  Polly. 

"A  plate  of  deviled  crabs  that  will  reach 
from  here  to  Frisco  and  everything  that  goes 
with  them,"  Polly  orders.  And  the  tourists 
from  Iowa  run  home  to  talk  of  Polly's  appetite. 

Wednesday.  Ditto  time  and  place.  Enter 
Polly. 

"Small  dish  of  stewed  apricots,  please." 

And  on  Thursday.  "A  sirloin  steak  with 
seven  onions." 

And  on  and  on  it  goes.  You  can't  tell  a 
thing  about  the  Moran  appetite.  Neither  can 
Polly. 

Carole  Lombard  is  a  spinach  hound.    Four 


years  ago  Carole  was  very  much  overweight. 
"Eat  spinach,"  her  doctor  said,  "you'll  get 
nourishment  without  fat."  (How  about  it 
Sylvia?)  Gradually  Carole  grew  fond  of  her 
spinach  until  now  it's  spinach  for  lunch, 
spinach  for  dinner  and  spinach  in  between 
times. 

You  can  always  see  a  strange  sight  or  two 
over  at  the  Paramount  lunch-room.  Tallulah 
Bankhead  furnishes  the  most  amusement. 
She  is  usually  surrounded  by  five  or  six  men 
at  luncheon  and  whenever  she  espies  another 
friend  she  jumps  up  from  the  table  and  rushes 
across  the  room  to  throw  her  arms  around  the 
new  lad  with  a  typical  Bankhead  greeting. 

Maurice  Chevalier  is  always  very  dignified. 
And  when  Tallulah  rushes  over  to  embrace 
him  he  rises  with  great  formality  and  kisses 
her  hand. 

""THE  Marx  Brothers  entrance  is  one  of  those 
*■  things  everybody  notices.  You  couldn't  help 
noticing  four  cyclones,  could  you?  They  al- 
ways make  an  entrance — sometimes  on  all 
fours,  sometimes  with  a  double  somersault — 
but    it's    an    entrance! 

And  Marlene  Dietrich  and  Josef  Von  Stern- 
berg make  an  entrance,  too.  But  not  quite 
like  the  Marx  Brothers.  They  glance  neither 
to  the  right  nor  left,  but  walk  straight  ahead 
to  a  small  table  always  reserved  for  them  at 
the  rear.  They  always  lunch  together  and 
are  absolutely  lost  in  conversation  together, 
as  if  a  magic  circle  were  drawn  about  them 
and  no  one  dare  trespass.     And  no  one  does. 

The  stars  invariably  come  right  off  the  set 
for  luncheon  and  are  always  in  costume  and 
make-up.  The  men  tuck  their  handkerchiefs 
— honest,  it  isn't  their  napkins — under  their 
collars,  so  the  greasepaint  won't  rub  off  and 
spoil  their  nice,  shiny,  white  collars. 

When  Ann  Harding  is  ready  for  one  of 
those  subtle,  clever  scenes  of  hers  Ann  eats 
a  handful  of  raisins  and  drinks  a  glass  of  milk. 
Without  the  subtle,  clever  scenes  Ann  eats 
healthily  and  normally.  Huge  platters  of 
hors-d'oeuvres  only  for  luncheon  is  one  of 
Ann's  favorites  and,  dear  me,  how  those  blue 
eyes  light  up  at  the  sight  of  creamed  chipped 
beef  on  toast.    Well  now. 

But  when  Ann's  cook  scrapes  the  pulp  from 
the  shell  of  an  avacado,  mashes  it,  mixes  it 
with  finely  grated  onions,  salt,  dash  of  paprika 
and  a  little  lemon  juice,  places  it  back  in  the 
shell  and  serves  as  a  salad,  you  should  see  how 
Annie  Harding  behaves  then. 

And  here's  where  the  little  girls  and  boys 
below  the  Mason  and  Dixon  line  rise  right  up 
and  cheer.  Irene  Dunne  goes  in  for  corn  pone 
in  a  great  big  way.  Yas  sir.  Irene  must  have 
her  corn  pone. 

"DICHARD  BARTHELMESS  will  get  up 
■*-Vn  the  middle  of  the  night  for  a  Spanish  egg 
omelette,  and  Evalyn  Knapp  will  hunt  all  over 
town  for  corn  beef  and  cabbage.    (Page  Jiggs.) 

Joe  E.  Brown  has  a  favorite  dessert.  Ten 
scoops  of  vanilla  ice  cream  with  ten  scoops  of 
strawberry,  chocolate,  pineapple  (oh,  give 
him  the  works)  pour  chocolate  sauce  with 
chopped  nuts  all  over  it,  watch  Joe  E.  open  up 
that  cavern  and  see  what  happens. 

But  nobody  notices  much,  for,  studio  com- 
missaries are  the  strangest  eating  places  in 
the  world. 

They  are  different  architecturally  but  they 
are  alike  in  spirit — all  noisy,  always  crowded, 
always  filled  with  conversation  and  laughter. 
And  things  that  would  amaze  you  and  me 
don't  get  a  glance  from  Hollywood  eaters. 

Yet  these  lunch-rooms  have  their  pathetic 
side,  too.  Once  famous  stars,  who  are  now 
doing  bits,  always  manage  to  choose  tables 
near  some  famous  director,  hoping  to  be  seen, 
begging  to  be  noticed  and  smiling  quickly  and

A  BOY  FRIEND 
WHO  NEEDS  A  JOB? 


YOl  ING  woman,  you  can 
help  him  get  one!  Strange 
as  it  may  seem  in  these 
limes,  there  is  a  group  of  500  man- 
ufacturers seeking  bright  young 
men — and  women,  too. 
They  can  work  right  in  their  own 
home  towns,  and  are  offered  an 
amazing  variety  of  quick-selling 
novelties  and  high  grade  merchan- 
dise which  every  home  must  have. 
Go  right  out  today  and  invest  ten 
cents  in  a  copy  of  Opportunity 
Macazine.  It's  on  all  newsstands. 
l.nc  it  to  him  and  say, '"Boy,  there's 
your  chance.  Don't  say  I  never 
ga\e  you  a  start  in  life.  Some  day 
yon  may  come  to  me  and  thank  me 
for  starting  you  in  a  real  business 
career." 

Even  if  he  has  never  sold  anything 
if  he  has  the  gumption  and  any 
personality  at  all.  he  can  make  a

Opportunity  tells  him  how  to  do

wistfully  every  time  a  director  glances  their 
way. 

Doug  Fairbanks,  Jr.  is  what  is  known  as  a 
"table  jumper."  At  the  First  National  com- 
missary he  goes  from  table  to  table  chatting 
to  his  friends  and  is  a  great  gagster.  If  you 
happen  to  order  watermelon  you're  not  safe 
with  Doug,  Jr.  around,  for  he's  sure  to  come 
rushing  over  to  your  table  and  shoot  the 
seeds  at  the  heads  of  dignified  stars  and 
directors. 

Most  of  the  stars  who  come  into  the  com- 
missary come  for  a  bit  of  fun  and  everything 
is  gay  and  informal.  Lots  of  them,  including 
Ruth  Chatterton,  always  have  their  luncheon 
served   in   their   dressing-rooms. 

"DUSTER  K EATON  eats  in  his  kennel,  as 
■^ Buster  calls  his  dressing-room.  He  employs 
his  own  colored  cook  and  has  one  dish  only. 
If  it's  chicken-a-la-king,  there's  the  lunch.  If 
it's  macaroni,  there's  another  lunch.  And  al- 
ways the  kennel  is  packed  with  hungry  visitors 
passing  over  their  plates  for  refills. 

Richard  Dix  prepares  a  special  Richard  Dix 
salad  dressing  at  his  table  in  the  RKO  dining 
room,  Groucho  Marx  dotes  on  apple  pie  and 
Edna  May  Oliver  bakes  herself  a  crock  of 
baked  beans  every  Saturday  night  and,  then, 
in  true  Boston  style,  she  has  them  for  Sunday 
morning    breakfast. 

And  Anita  Page,  sipping  her  sugarless  tea 
and  nibbling  her  thin  graham  crackers  gazes 
across  the  Brown  Derby  at  Maurice  Chevalier, 
intent  on  his  American  waffles,  with  a  lean  and 
hungry  look. 

And  eating  in  Holly-wood  goes  merrily  on. 
Everybody  eating  the  thing  no  one  expects 
them  to.  Until  the  time  comes  to  yell  for 
Sylvia. 

And  then — ah,  there's  the  rub. 


••'red  R.  Archer 


Shed  no  tears  for  poor  Rin-Tin-Tin. 
He  died  after  having  lived  fourteen 
useful  years,  rich  in  service,  and  now 
goes  to  the  best  of  dog  heavens,  we 
are  sure.  He  earned,  during  his  life- 
time on  the  screen,  $300,000,  and  his 
name  is  to  be  carried  on,  for  his  son, 
Rin-Tin-Tin,  Jr.,  has  been  carefully 
trained  in  all  his  father's  tricks  and 
will   carry  on  in  his  father's  roles

SINNERS  IN  THE  SUN— Paramount.— Carole

not  unentertaining  story.  And  you  must  see  Carole's

Arlen  and  Jack  Oakie.     (July)

fine  cast  including  Warren  William.     (Sept.) 

SO  BIG — Warners. — Barbara  Stanwyck  gives  a 
great  individual  performance  but  the  picture  has  not 
the  emotional  kick  of  the  silent  version.     (May) 

SOCIETY   GIRL— Fox.— Jimmie  Dunn  tries  to 

be  a  tough  boxer,  but  he's  too  nice  to  be  quite  be- 
lievable.     Pleasant   enough   film,    however.     (Aug.) 

SPEAK  EASILY  —  M-G-M.  —  Jimmy  Durante 

does  a  swell  burlesque  of  himself  in  this  goofiest  of 
comedies.  Buster  Keaton  is  funny  too.  See  this!

STRANGE  CASE  OF  CLARA  DEANE.  THE— 

Paramount. — A  strong  picture,  but  so  similar  to  "The 
Sin  of  Madelon  Claudet"  that  it  detracts  from  its 
punch.  Cora  Sue  Collins  looms  up  as  one  of  the  few 
t  Mid  performers.  Frances  Dee  and  Dudley

NATURE  and 

COLLEGE  INN 

give  you  the  ONE 

Tomato  Cocktail 

NATURE  outdid  herself  when  she 
produced  the  big,  red,  ripe  to- 
matoes that  are  used  for  original 
College  Inn  Cocktail.  But  you 
couldn't  expect  the  dear  old  lady  to 
do  it  all. 

That's  where  College  Inn's  famous 
chefs  come  in.  They  pick  up  where 
nature  left  off,  adding  just  the  right 
touch  of  seasoning  to  make  a  spicy, 
invigorating  cocktail —  full-flavored, 
full-bodied.  And  it's  packed  by  the 
exclusive  Hi -Vita  process;  preserves 
all  the  original  delicate  flavor  and 
vitamins. 

\  ou'll  know  College  Inn  at  the  first 
taste — because  College  Inn  is  the  only 
masterfully  seasoned  tomato  drink. 
There's  no  more  reason  to  drink 
unseasoned  tomato  juice  than  to  eat 
unseasoned  meat  or  salad!

in  the  last  two  seconds  he  is  conscious  before  electro- 
cution. Edward  Robinson's  work  is  memorable  and 
the  beauty  of  Vivienne  Osborne  impressive.     (June) 

UNASHAMED— M-G-M.— Lewis  Stone  tries  hard 
to  save  this  unbelievable  story,  but  doesn't  quite. 
Helen  Twelvetrees  and  Robert  Young.     (Sepl.) 

VANISHING  FRONTIER,  THE— Paramount. 
— You'll  like  Johnny  Mack  Brown  with  a  Spanish 
accent  as  the  hold-up  man  in  this  story  of  early 
California.      (Sept.) 

VANITY  FAIR— Allied  Pictures.  — They've 
dressed  Becky  Sharp  up  in  modern  clothes  and  made 
her  Myrna  Loy,  and  if  you  didn't  read  the  book 
you'll  enjoy  the  picture.     (May) 

•  WASHINGTON  MASOUERADE,  THE  — 
M-G-M.— Washington— politics— Lionel  Barry- 
more  as  the  respected  attorney  who  goes  wrong,  and 
Karen  Morley  as  the  scheming  vamp.  A  grand 
picture.  (Sept.) 

WAYWARD  —  Paramount.  —  A  lot  of  plots 
wrapped  in  one  celluloid  package.  Nancy  Carroll, 
Richard  Arlcn  and  Pauline  Frederick.     (April) 

WEEK-END  MARRIAGE— First  National  — 
Wives,  it  seems  from  this,  shouldn't  work  and 
Loretta  Young  and  Norman  Foster  explain  it  all  in 
this  earnest  picture.      (Aug.) 

WEEK  ENDS  ONLY— Fox.— Not  new  in  plot, 
but  camouflaged  with  bright  tinsel.  Joan  Bennett 
does  well  as  a  rich  girl  made  poor  by  the  stock  market 
crash.     (A  ug.) 

WESTWARD  PASSAGE  —  RKO-Pathe.  —  Ann 
Harding.  ZaSu  Pitts  and  Irving  Pichel.  The  story  is 
entertaining  enough  but  it  lacks  pep  and  punch. 
(Aug.) 

*WET  PARADE— M-G-M.— Both  sides  of  the 
prohibition  problem  presented  in  two  hours  of 
exciting,  thrilling  drama  with  an  excellent  cast. 
Don't  miss  this.     (May) 

•  WHAT  PRICE  HOLLYWOOD  —  RKO- 
Pathe. — Fast  and  fascinating  entertainment 
and  all  very  true  to  Hollywood.  Constance  Bennett 
gives  her  finest  performance.  Lowell  Sherman  is 
great.      (A  ug.) 

WHEN  A  FELLER  NEEDS  A  FRIEND— M-G- 

M. — The  fine  acting  of  Jackie  Cooper  and  Chic  Sale 
furnish  such  a  delicious  frosting,  you  forget  the  cake 
is  a  bit  soggy.    Full  of  humor  and  pathos.     (June) 

WHILE  PARIS  SLEEPS— Fox— A  rip-snorting 
mellerdrammer  of  Parisian  life  through  a  Hollywood 
spyglass.     (A  ug.) 

WHISTLIN'  DAN— Tiffany  Prod.— A  Ken  May- 
nard  Western  with  a  plot  above  the  average.     (May) 

WHITE  ZOMBIE— United  Artists. — An  utterly 
fantastic  tale  about  the  half-dead,  known  as  zombies, 
who  rise  from  their  graves.  Madge  Bellamy  and 
Bela  Lugosi.  And  you  don't  need  to  bother  seeing  it. 
(Sept.) 

WHY  SAPS  LEAVE  HOME— Best  International 
Pictures. — England  takes  a  jab  at  American  gangsters 
in  a  hilarious  travesty.     (May) 

•    WINNER  TAKE  ALL-Warners.— One  of  the 
fastest,  laugh-provoking  pictures  on  the  screen. 
Jimmy  Cagney  is  great.     Don't  miss  it.     (July) 

WISER  SEX,  THE— Paramount.— It  has  gang- 
sters and  politicians,  but  it  also  has  Claudette  Colbert 
and  Lilyan  Tashman.     (April) 

WITHOUT  HONOR— Supreme.— A  Western 
with  a  fair  amount  of  thrills.     (April) 

WOMAN  IN  ROOM  13,  THE— Fox— Wives, 
sweethearts  and  careers.  Elissa  Landi  gives  a  strong 
performance  in  a  weak  story.     (July) 

WORLD  AND  THE  FLESH,  THE— Paramount. 
— Against  a  Russian  background  are  set  George  Ban- 
croft and  Miriam  Hopkins.     Mild.     (July) 

WYOMING  WHIRLWIND.  THE— Willis  Kent 
Prod. — A  Lane  Chandler  Western.    (July) 

•  YOUNG  AMERICA— Fox.— This  is  about 
those  youngsters  who  get  the  reputation  for 
being  the  "worst  kids  in  town.''  Raymond  Borzage 
steals  the  show.  Doris  Kenyon  has  never  been  love- 
lier, and  Spencer  Tracy  and  Ralph  Bellamy  do  grand 
work.      (June) 

YOUNG  BRIDE— RKO-Pathe.— Eric  Linden  and 
Helen  Twelvetrees  are  better  than  the  story.    (May) 

ZANE  GREY'S  SOUTH  SEA  ADVENTURES— 

Sol  Lesser. — Author  Zane  Grey  goes  fishing  in  the 
South  Seas  for  five  reels.    (April)

Doug,  Jr.  Walks 
and  Talks 

[  CONTINUED  FROM  PACE  71  ] 

Doug  looked  more  disgusted  than  ever. 

"But  I  haven't,"  he  explained.  "I  haven't 
any  money.    I  don't  make  much  money. 

"As  a  matter  of  fact,  I  made  more  money  the 
first  year  I  worked  in  pictures  than  I  have  any 
year  since.  That  was  nine  years  ago  when  I 
made  'Stephen  Steps  Out,'  and  the  producers 
thought  the  Fairbanks  name  would  draw 
customers  no  matter  who  was  behind  it. 

"Well,  they  found  out,  and  I  haven't  made 
as  much  money  per  week  since. 

"  I'm  always  broke.  I  don't  worry  about  it, 
but  I'm  always  broke.  We  don't  live  as  simply 
as  we  might,  but  we  don't  live  extravagantly, 
either.  I  took  the  money  out  of  my  savings 
account  to  make  this  trip.  I  certainly  expect 
to  make  more  money  than  I  do  now,  one  of 
these  days." 

T^OUG  stopped  pacing  and  glared.  "Say.  I 
-'-'haven't  had  a  new  suit  in  more  than  two 
years.  This,  this  is  one  of  my  newest  suits  and 
it's — "  he  dug  into  the  inner  coat  pocket  and 
exposed  the  tailor's  mark  to  the  light.  "1929," 
he  said  triumphantly,  "three  years  old.  I've 
some  new  trousers  and  shoes,  but  I  haven't 
spent  any  real  money  on  clothes  for  two  years." 

"Well?" 

The  pacing  started  again.  Back  and  forth; 
back  and  forth. 

"Suppose,"  began  Doug  suddenly,  "suppose 
we  dope  out  a  story  that  I  haven't  arrived." 

"  Not  artistically  or  financially  or — " 

"  Xot  any  way  at  all.  I  haven't  done  any  of 
the  things  I  intend  to  do  as  well  as  I  intend  to 
do  them.  Can't  you  write  that  I  haven't 
arrived?" 

"Yes,  but—" 

"I  really  haven't." 

"All  right." 

"I  promised  to  drop  in  on  stage  two  in  about 
five  minutes.  Have  you  enough  material?  Can 
you  do  a  story  about  my  not  having  arrived? '' 

"Yes  and  no." 

"Well,  what  more  do  you  want?  Ask  me 
some  questions?-' 

''What  did  you  do  yesterday?" 

"I  went  to  the  preview  last  night."  Doug's 
picture,  "Love  is  a  Racket,"  had  been  shown 
to  its  first  audience. 

"Then  I  went  home  and  sat  up  until  one 
o'clock  learning  lines  and  figuring  out  business 
on  the  new  picture." 

"How  do  you  generally  spend  your  eve- 
nings?" 

"We  run  pictures  at  heme,  we  dance  occa- 
sionally, we  go  to  the  beach  and  ride  the  roller 
coasters  or  we  have  other  couples  at  the  house 
and  just  talk." 

"What  do  you  talk  about?" 

"Well — just  lately — we've  been  talking 
about  how  we  should  hold  off  a  shark  with  our 
left  hand  while  we're  getting  a  knife  out  to 
battle  him  with  the  right  hand." 

"Do  you  play  bridge?" 

"Xo!"  with  emphasis. 

"What  did  you  do  today?'' 

"Y\  TELL.  I  looked  at  costumes  for  'Scarlet 
***  Dawn."  and  helped  polish  off  a  little 
additional  script.    I  helped  write  the  scenario, 
you  know.    Then  I  helped  load  the  boat  with 
equipment  and  food.    I  went  to  the  bank.    I 
had  lunch  with  Bob  Montgomery.  We're  going 
back  down  to  the  boat  now." 
"When  do  you  write  and  draw?" 
"Oh,  any  time.     Mornings,  late  at  night, 
during  dinner." 

"Where  do  you  write!" 
"  In  the  living  room  or  the  library  or  wher- 
ever I  am." 

"Longhand  or  typewriter?" 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  Octohkr,  1932 


"Well,  I  make  notes  by  hand.  Then  I  pick 
it  out  on  the  typewriter.  Then  I  correct  it  and 
dictate  it.  Then  I  correct  it  again  and  re- 
dictate  it.  Then  sometimes  I  throw  it  away. 
Sometimes  it's  published."  (The  pacing  is 
getting  more  and  more  vigorous.)  "I'm  either 
"  terribly  enthusiastic  about  anything  I'm  doing 
or  else  I  don't  give  a — a  damn  about  it.  But 
I  like  to  do  almost  everything.  I  play  the 
piano  well  enough  to  amuse  myself.  I  draw  a 
little,  paint  a  little,  write  a  little,  talk  too  much. 
I  like  to  swim,  except  that  it's  such  hard  work. 
]  have  a  good  car.  It's  my  only  extravagance. 
I  like  to  drive.  I've  been  arrested  driving 
too  fast. 

"  I  leave  my  things  scattered  about.  I  never 
see  a  new  piece  of  furniture  at  home  until  I 
bark  my  shins  on  it.  I  haven't  had  a  vacation 
in  five  years  except  the  ten  days  that  Joan  and 
I  were  in  New  York  last  fall.  (Their  European 
jaunt  was  still  just  a  day  dream  at  this  time.) 
This  is  the  first  time  I've  gone  on  a  trip  by 
myself  since  my  marriage.  I  can't  sleep  late. 
I  have  to  get  tanned  for  my  next  picture.  I 
haven't  arrived  and  I've  got  to  go  down  to  the 
boat  with  Bob  now  and  make  room  for  that 


Russian  orchestra, 
for  a  story?" 

"Well,  it'll  help." 


Is  that  enough  material 


"A  TAKE  it  about  my  not  having  arrived — 
•'■V-'-please.  I  haven't,  you  know.  I've  been 
at  it  long  enough  and  I  honestly  think  I'm 
better  than  I  was  but  I'm  not  where  I  hope  to 
get — yet." 

"  I'd  like  to  follow  you  around  for  a  couple 
of  days.    That  ought  to  make  a  story." 

"  Sure.  We'll  spend  a  day,  two  days,  some- 
time between  pictures.  You  come  out  to  the 
house.  I've  some  ideas.  Goodbye.  Don't 
forget — about  my  not  having  arrived." 

He  was  gone.  Douglas  Fairbanks,  Jr., 
pacing  son  of  a  galloping  father,  had  left 
Hollywood  for  a  cruise  in  Mexican  waters  on  a 
leased  yacht  (Cecil  B.  De  Mille's  yacht)  with  a 
Russian  orchestra  on  board  for  good  measure. 

But  he  promised  to  give  us  a  good  story — 
sometime.    He  has  some  ideas.

Grouchy  Irritable  Wives! 


"T\ON'T  speak  to  me,"  she  cries.  "I'm 
*-J  all  upset  and  want  to  be  alone." 

Why  is  it  ...  as  soon  as  a  woman's 
nerves  become  excited  she  hurts  the  ones 
she  loves? 

No  husband  can  understand  the  reason 
why!  What  has  changed  her  into  a  silent, 
moody  woman  . . .  always  grumbling  and 
flying  into  a  rage  over  a  trifle? 

Those  dreadful  headaches  and  back- 
aches .  .  .  that  bearing-down  feeling  and 


fits  of  dizziness  ...  these  things  only  a 
woman  knows. 

Yet  your  happiness  is  threatened.  Your 
husband's  (patience  may  end.  What  are 
you  going  to  do  about  it?

you  stop  at  the  ESSEX  HOUSE 
.  .  .  the  theatrical  district  on  one  side, 
the  open  calm  of  Central  Park  on  the 
other.  Here  you  live  high  above  the 
rumble  of  the  city,  yet  right  in  the 
middle  of  Manhattan.  You  enjoy 
the  convenience  of  an  ultra-modern 
urban  residence  overlooking  more 
open  country  than  a  Westchester 
estate.

Photoplay  Magazine  for  October,  1932 


i*5 


She  Sat  on  the  Floor 


CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  40 


A  saleswoman  with  a  definite  proposition. 
A  saleswoman  with  samples  that  told  the  whole 
story — pictures  of  a  girl  in  a  black  negligee. 

She  wasn't  asking  a  favor.  Irving  Thalberg 
needed  a  woman  for  "Arsene  Lupin."  Well, 
she  was  offering  him  one — of  good  value,  too, 
she  knew. 

She  made  the  sale. 

T  HAVE  often  wondered  what  passed  through 
-Mrving  Thalberg's  mind  at  that  moment.  I 
believe  there  is  only  one  woman  on  the  Metro 
lot  who  had  ever  before  approached  him  in  such 
a  Concretely  business-like  manner.  Her  name 
is  Xorma  Shearer. 

The  same  adjectives  apply  to  Karen  which 
have  always  applied  to  Mrs.  Thalberg — 
shrewd,  clever,  hard-in-business,  self-sufficient, 
inordinately  ambitious,  contemptuous-of-in- 
efficiency,  judicial-like-a-man,  fair-minded  and, 
necessarily,  a  bit  self-centered. 

Hard,  professionally.  Femininely  alert,  per- 
sonally. 

Everyone  understood  why  Karen  fought  for 
that  role  in  "Arsene  Lupin."  To  play  leading 
lady  to  the  Barrymores  was  something  that 
any  actress,  whether  old-timer  or  newcomer, 
would  covet.  But  no  one  could  grasp  why  she 
put  up  an  equally  determined  sales  campaign 
to  secure  the  cold,  cruel,  unsympathetic  role  in 
'"Are  You  Listening?" 

It  was  one  which  most  girls  would  quickly 
and  definitely  spurn. 

Karen  explained  it  briefly:  "I  know  I  am  not 
pretty.  I  cannot  make  a  place  for  myself  on 
the  screen  as  a  beauty.  I  am  not  even  an 
exciting  person.  There  is,  therefore,  only  one 
thing  left.  I  must  be  an  actress.  And  the  more 
variety  I  can  get,  the  more  they  will  think  of 
me  as  a  capable  actress.  There  is  just  one 
thing  I  have  not  done.  Light  comedy.  So  far, 
no  one  has  seen  the  comedienne  possibilities  in 
me.    But  they  will!" 

If  you  knew  her,  you  would  not  doubt  that 
she'll  realize  that  ambition,  too.  Karen  is  said 
to  be  extremely  close-mouthed.  They  tell  that 
Anita  Page  and  Karen  took  tests  for  "Red- 
Headed  Woman"  at  about  the  same  time. 
Trusting  little  Anita  excitedly  told  everyone 
that  she  might  secure  this  big  opportunity.  She 
had  taken  a  test! 

Xot  Karen!  If  she  didn't  secure  the  part, 
it  wasn't  necessary  that  the  world  should  know 
that  Jean  Harlow  was  considered  more  fitted 
for  the  role  than  Karen  Morley. 

Madge  Evans  has  taken  several  of  the  parts 
for  which  Miss  Morley  has  been  tested.  No 
one  but  the  authorities  knew  it. 

Karen  had  seen  to  that.  Wrhy  invite  com- 
parisons? 

But  she  is  not  always  so  silent.  She  can 
chatter  like  a  magpie  when  it  is  advantageous. 

"COR  example,  when  another  studio  sends  for 
■*-  her  to  make  a" test,  she  tells  everyone  about 
it  whether  she  secures  the  role  or  not.  To  be 
even  considered  by  another  studio  is  a  chalk- 
mark  in  any  actress's  favor.  The  home  studio 
always  appreciates  the  girl  whom  another 
studio  even  remembers  for  a  test. 

Irene  Dunne  won  the  lead  in  Universal's 
"Back  Street,"  against  the  Morley  competi- 
tion. Karen  never  forgets  to  mention  the  fact 
that  she  was  borrowed  for  the  test  or  to  explain 
casually  that  it  was  natural  that  Irene  should 
be  chosen.  She  had  already  established,  in 
"Cimarron,"  a  name  for  the  ability  to  change 
from  young  girl  to  old  woman.  Universal 
wanted  the  name! 

(Likewise,  when  Karen  returned  to  Metro 
from  being  borrowed  by  Fox  to  play  the  lead 
with  Warner  Baxter  in  "Man  About  Town," 
she  did  plenty  of  chatting.  In  fact,  she  almost 
raved  about  the  royal  manner  in  which  she  had 


been  treated  by  the  other  studio.  A  suite  for 
her  dressing-room.  With  private  bath.  A 
stand-in  sirl. 

She  told  how  she  had  received  every  small 
attention,  usually  accorded  only  to  acknow- 
ledged stars  with  four-figured  salaries. 

Good  business  to  let  Metro  know  that  Fox 
already  accepted  her  as  a  star  as  they  would 
Joan  Crawford,  had  she  been  the  one  borrowed. 

Naturally,  she  wisecracked  about  the  Fox 
glory.  She  would  never  lay  herself  open  to  the 
criticism  of  being  "boastful." 

When  she  told  about  the  dressing-room,  for 
example,  she  jested  with,  "Of  course,  I  didn't 
need  the  bath.  I  was  home  on  Saturday 
nights." 

One  day  she  sprained  her  ankle.  The  next 
day  Nora  Gregor,  leading  lady  for  Bob  Mont- 
gomery, sprained  hers.  "Gee,"  Karen  ex- 
claimed, "  I'm  getting  important.  I'm  starting 
fads  already." 

It  was  in  fun,  but  the  fun  carried  a  subtle 
suggestion  of  importance. 

UNTIL  very  recently,  Karen  had  attended 
only  one  Hollywood  opening — and  that  at 
the  definite  request  of  the  studio.  She  did  not 
go  to  any  of  the  places  where  stars  or  would-be- 
stars  are  supposed  to  go.  They  said  it  was 
because  she  was  keeping  all  the  old  friends  she 
had  made  in  college  and  going  to  the  same  old 
collegiate  hang-outs. 

Perhaps.  But  I'd  be  more  inclined  to  believe 
it  was  because  she's  shrewd  enough  not  to  go  to 
public  places  where  she  is  a  part  of  the  fringe 
rather  than  the  main  pattern.  If  she  was  not 
important  enough  to  be  pointed  out  as  Karen 
Morley  "the  movie  actress,"  why  go  where 
others  would  be  so  designated? 

She's  started  stepping  out  more.  But  she's 
known  now.  She  has  three  good  pictures  to 
her  credit.  She  is  recognized  as  one  of  the 
centers  of  the  pattern — a  celebrity  rather  than 
an  unknown. 

She  also  has  changed  boy  friends.  She  had 
gone  for  years  with  one  lad — Carol  Dempster's 
nephew.  What  happened  only  Karen  knows 
and  she'll  never  tell.  Nor  will  she  give  you  the 
name  of  the  handsome  new  escort — non-profes- 
sional. She's  borrowed  that  much  from  Greta 
Garbo's  sales  book.  She  believes  they'll  talk 
more  and  write  more  if  you  keep  them  guessing. 
The  world,  once  it  knows  all  about  your  love 
affairs,  loses  interest. 

I  don't  want  to  give  you  an  impression  that 
Karen,  at  twenty-one,  is  all  saleswoman.  She's 
feminine,  with  all  the  little  tricks  that  go  with 
that.  One  day,  while  I  was  talking  with  her, 
she  announced  several  times  that  she  knew  she 
wasn't  pretty.  I  suspected  that  the  wholly 
feminine  side  of  her  was  protesting  too  much  in 
the  hopes  that  I  would  deny  it  and  call  her 
pretty. 

Incidentally,  she  looks  terrible  in  hats. 
Therefore,  she  seldom  wears  them.  Not  even 
when  she  is  shopping. 

"L_TOW  could  one  so  young  be  so  wise?  The 
■*•  -^-answer  is  simple.  She  was  born  that  way. 
Her  ancestors  were  Scotch.  But  you've  read 
her  life  history  elsewhere.  I  won't  repeat.  She's 
always  left  that  which  she  didn't  enjoy,  like 
college,  and  sought  what  she  did — the  Pasadena 
Community  Players.  Even  though  she  didn't 
have  the  money  to  warrant  following  her  in- 
clinations. In  this  way,  she  is  much  like  Clark 
Gable. 

Yes,  Karen  Morley  was  born  a  saleswoman. 

As  a  small  child,  she  took  her  first  trip  on  a 
train.  She  didn't  want  anyone  on  the  train  to 
recognize  her  inexperience  so  when  she  went 
into  the  diner,  she  exclaimed  loudly,  "I  will 
take  potatoes.  They  are  always  good  on 
trains."

No  Headlines  for  Helen 


CONTIXUED  FROM  PAGE  70 


like  one  as  well,  Helen  knew  that  she  could 
not  pull  any  typical  wifely,  "No's."  I  feel 
certain  that  she  often  wishes  he  would  not  do 
many  of  the  things  that  he  does,  but  above  all 
else  she  wants  his  happiness — her  love  is  as 
great  as  that. 

For  herself  she  would  love  a  home  that  de- 
manded all  the  small,  seemingly  unimportant 
duties  which  mean  commonplace  living.  Helen 
would  like  leading  a  commonplace  life. 

"DUT  because  she  loves  Charlie  so  much  she 
-'-'takes  him  as  he  is  and  says,  "Married  life 
with  an  actress  is  terrible.  All  actresses  in 
the  threes  of  work  should  live  alone — they  are 
not  fit  for  human  consumption,  since  they 
must  think  entirely  about  their  work  and  them- 
selves while  they  are  working. 

"That  is  difficult  for  the  husband — and  awful 
for  the  actress. 

"A  man  refuses  to  recognize  any  talent  but 
his  own,  if  he  has  any  egotism  at  all,  which — 
thank  goodness — Charlie  has.  " 

Her  eyes  became  misty.  "Did  you  read 
O.  O.  Mclntyre's  column  the  day  he  spoke  of 
Charlie's  'impish  expression'?  It  describes 
him  perfectly.  He  has  a  crazy  sort  of  humor. 
Oh,  it's  Charlie's  madnesses  that  make  him 
fascinating. 

"It  is  only  during  the  last  year  and  a  half 
that  I  have  felt  even  momentary  contentment 
growing  in  him.  He  has  an  itch  on  the  inside 
— as  all  great  artists  have. " 

Yet  Helen  neglected  to  add  that  she,  herself, 
is  a  great  artist.  The  difference,  you  see,  is 
that  her  fine  flights  are  saved  for  her  work. 
Personally — she  is  a  quiet,  practical,  domestic 
little  thing. 

There  have  been  rumors  of  a  divorce  between 
these  two.  I  doubt  that  there  is  a  basis  for  them. 

Helen  knew  all  about  Charlie  MacArthur 
before  they  were  married.  She  met  him,  so 
she  told  me,  after  the  first  Mrs.  MacArthur 
sued  for  divorce,  but  she  did  not  marry  him 
until  she  had  known  him  for  a  year  and  a  half. 
She  understood  his  type  of  genius. 

At  that  time  she  told  a  friend,  "I  know  that 
life  with  Charlie  is  not  going  to  be  all  happiness. 
But  I  have  looked  at  the  situation  squarely. 
I  love  him.  And  the  moments  of  unhappiness 
are  going  to  be  forgotten  because  of  the 
moments  of  happiness— even  though  there  are 
more  of  the  former.  I  am  willing  to  go  through 
any  suffering  to  have  even  brief  periods  of  the 
real  joy  which  he  will  bring  me." 
. .  Suits  against  her  began  almost  immediately 
after  their  marriage.  And  how  Helen  hated 
them!  When  she  was  served  with  these  last 
papers  in  Chicago  on  her  way  to  Hollywood 
to  make  "A  Farewell  to  Arms"  her  knees 
crumpled  beneath  her  and  she  fell. 


And  I'm  sure  that  no  one  but  Helen  knows 
the  hurt  she  felt  when  she  read  that  amazing 
line  about  her  child — "the  act  of  God  baby." 

Do  you  remember  how  the  thing  happened? 
Even  though  she  knew  she  was  going  to  have  a 
baby,  she  had  thought  herself  able  to  complete 
the  run  of  her  then-current  success  "Coquette." 
But  one  day  her  physician  told  her,  "I  will 
not  be  responsible  for  your  life  if  you  step  on 
the  stage  again  before  the  child  is  born." 

This  meant  that  the  other  actors  in  the 
cast  were  not  given  the  customary  two- weeks 
warning  that  the  play  was  closing,  so  the 
manager  looked  over  the  contracts  eager  to 
find  a  way  out  of  paying  salaries.  He  dis- 
covered that  a  fire  or  an  "act  of  God"  might 
release  him  from  his  obligations  (it  didn't) — 
hence  the  child  became  the  "act  of  God" 
baby  and  brought  its  mother  reams  of  front 
page  publicity — which  she  wanted  less  than 
anything  in  the  world. 

Helen  doesn't  like  working  in  pictures,  and 
I  believe  that  she  would  never  act  in  another 
movie  were  Charlie  MacArthur  not  writing 
in  Hollywood.  She  knows  she  is  not  beautiful 
and  she  feels  that  she  lacks  the  Garbo-Dietrich 
type  of  glamour.  The  cold  "set"  with  its 
business-like  atmosphere  makes  her  want  to 
crawl  away  to  some  quiet  corner.  Only  when 
she  is  actually  before  a  camera  and  becomes 
the  character  she  is  portraying  does  this 
emotion  leave  her. 

She  looked  at  the  scenes  taken  the  first  day 
when  she  was  making  "The  Sin  of  Madelon 
Claudet."  With  tears  of  disappointment  in 
her  eyes  she  left  the  projection  room.  She 
thought  that  she  photographed  badly  and  that 
her  work  was  inferior.  Imagine,  the  great 
actress,  Helen  Hayes,  who  has  held  theater 
audiences  spellbound,  thinking  her  work  in- 
f  ?rior ! 

A  GAIN  during  "Arrowsmith"  she  went  into 
■*  *-the  projection  room.  When  she  saw  herself 
appear  she  left  saying,  "I  looked  so  awful,  I 
couldn't  stand  watching  it  another  minute." 

And  although  she  is  keenly  interested  in  her 
present  production,  "A  Farewell  to  Arms," 
she  has  not  looked  at  one  shot  they  have  taken. 

But,  strangely  enough,  she  is  happy. 

"Marriage,  love  and  life  are  a  matter  of 
credits  and  debits,"  she  said.  "Even  if  there 
be  more  debits — only  the  credits  matter. 
Charlie  and  I  have  never  come  to  the  point 
where  we  have  nothing  to  say  to  each  other. 
When  we  sit  down  at  the  dinner  table  we  have 
so  much  to  tell  that  we  both  talk  at  once. 
That  is  marvelous.  As  long  as  two  people 
have  something  to  talk  about  every  minute, 
it's  great.  Happiness  is  so  wonderful  that  un- 
happiness doesn't  count!"

Here  is  one  little  necklace  that  plays  several  parts,  for  Anita  Page  has 
evolved  the  three-in-one  jewel  set.  For  evening  wear — the  neck- 
lace. For  less  formal  occasions  a  clip  and  bracelet — all  done  with  just 
a  simple  twist  of  the  wrist.    Smart  girl,  Anita,  and  a  thrifty  one,  too 


/"COLUMNIST  Sidney  Skolsky  is  responsible 
^^for  this  grand  yarn.  Seems  that  out  on  the 
Ronald  Colman  set  the  script  demanded  that 
Colman  introduce  two  extras,  supposedly  titled 
Englishmen.  One  of  them  he  introduced  as 
the  Marquis  of  Annadale. 

'Wait  a  minute,"  somebody  said.  "You 
can't  say  that.  There  is  a  real  person  named 
the  Marquis  of  Annadale  and  if  we  used  the 
name  there  would  be  a  libel  suit  against  us. " 

Just  then  the  extra  spoke  up.  "Xo,  there 
won't  be  a  libel  suit.  You  can  use  the  name, 
for  I  am  the  Marquis  of  Annadale. " 

That  seven-fifty  a  day  extra  job  was  his  first. 

TT  actually  happened  in  Hollywood. 
A  writer  stood  on  a  street  corner 
and  conversed  with  a  prominent 
actor  and  his  wife.  And  the  subject 
of  the  conversation,  with  details,  was 
the  terrible  crush  the  writer  once  had 
on  the  actor's  wife.  And  they  stood 
there  telling  incidents  and  laughing 
about  it  together.  And  isn't  the  old 
film  town  getting  nonchalant! 

T_T()I.EYWOOD.  the  home  of  many  Ziegfeld 
graduates,  was  shocked  to  hear  of  the  fa- 
mous producer's  sudden  death.  Eddie  Cantor, 
Marilyn  Miller,  Marie  Dressier.  I.ilyan  Tash- 
man.  Dorothy  Mackaill.  "NX" ill  Rogers.  Marion 
Davies.  I.upe  Velez,  Billie  Dove,  Edna  May 
Oliver.  Virginia  Bruce  and  many  other  famous 
names  in  Hollywood,  were  grief-stricken  at 
Mr.  Ziegfeld 's  passing. 

H's  wife,  the  lo.-ely  Billie  Burke,  was  making 
a  picture  at  Radio  Pictures  studios  when  the 
end  came. 

Although  the  doctors  had  given  every  hope 


for  his  recovery,  Miss  Burke  had  a  premonition 
that  the  end  was  near.  Like  a  faithful  trouper, 
she  stuck  to  her  post  until  the  frantic  message 
of  "Hurry,  come  quickly"  was  received. 

Hollywood  salutes  the  greatest  showman  of 
the  last  century  and  deeply  mourns  his  passing. 

TACK  BARRYMORE  is  now  busily  at  work 
J  making  a  guide  book  for  guests  who  visit  his 
estate.  Seems  that  the  other  day  a  cameraman 
arrived  to  take  photographs  around  the  place. 
He  rang  the  bell  at  the  gate.  A  buzzer  sounded 
and  the  gate  swung  open  dramatically.  That 
was  at  five  forty-five.  At  six-fifteen  the  pho- 
tographer, weary  and  footsore,  located  the  Bar- 
rymore  living  room.  He  says  he  knows  how 
explorers  lost  in  the  .African  jungle  feel.  The 
answer  is  that  all  the  rooms  are  in  separate 
buildings.  The  living  room  forms  one  house; 
the  master  bedroom  another;  the  guest  rooms 
are  all  delightful  little  bungalows.  Just  an- 
other Barrymore  eccentricity. 

"DEING  elegant  certainly  does 
"^trouble  the  Hollywood  hostesses, 
because  just  as  surely  as  they  have  a 
swanky  dinner  party  and  put  smart 
place  cards  around,  the  guests  jump 
in  and  re-arrange  the  cards  so  that 
the  boy  and  girl  friends  can  sit  next 
to  each  other  and  actresses  with  axes 
to  grind  can  talk  to  directors  during 
dinner. 

"D  EM  EM  HER  when  Ruth  Chatterton  signed 
J"Nier  new  contract  with  Warners  that  she 
was  given  final  word  on  all  stories  and  that  she 
could  reject  and  okay  all  her  own  screen  ma- 
terial.   It  was  this  little  clause  in  the  contract 


that  decided  Ruth  to  leave  Paramount  and  go 
over  with  the  boys  in  Burbank. 

Xow  Warners  have  issued  a  statement  which 
declares  that  no  future  contracts  will  carry  a 
provision  that  players  may  have  any  choice  of 
stories  or  roles.  This  happened  just  after  Ruth 
made  two  films  under  her  new  contract.  And 
you  can  write  your  own  conclusion. 

r^OXXIE  BEXXETT,  Lil  Tashman  el  al. 
^^*had  better  look  to  their  "  well  dressed  wom- 
an" laurels,  for  that  cute  little  mite  Helen 
Hayes  came  back  to  Hollywood  with  trunkfuls 
of  new  clothes.    And  looking  just  that  chic! 

It's  funny  about  Helen.  Everybody  raved 
so  much  about  her  acting  ability  that  they  for- 
got to  notice  that  she  has  one  of  the  prettiest 
figures  you'll  see  along  Boul'  Hollywood. 


Movie-goers,  keep  your  eyes  on  this 
lad — he's  been  walking  away  with  a 
lot  of  pictures  lately.  And  it's  a  pretty 
brisk  pace  that  Ralph  Bellamy  paces, 
too.  Judging  by  the  smile  behind 
that  cigar  the  lad  the  girls  all  liked  in 
"Rebecca  of  Sunnybrook  Farm"  i~, 
pretty   pleased  with  this  old  worlJ.

Photoplay  Magazine  for  November,  1932 


IET  her  exercise  her  wits  on  contract  all 
j  she  wants  to!  But  if  she  wants  to  be 
attractive  when  she  smiles  and  talks,  it 
would  pay  her  to  spend  a  few  seconds  a 
day  exercising  her  gums! 

People  get  a  mighty  good  close-up  of 
your  teeth  at  the  bridge  table!  How  about 
your  teeth  and  gums?  If  you  have  flabby, 
sickly  gums— if  you  have  "pink  tooth 
brush" — watch  out!  Before  long,  you  may 
be  ashamed  to  smile! 


Modern  foods  are  too  soft  to  exercise 
the  gums  properly.  And  when  yonr  gums 
become  soft  and  tender,  you're  likely  to 
find  "pink"  on  your  tooth  brush  pretty 
regularly. 

Do  you  realize  that ' '  pink  tooth  brush 
robs  the  teeth  of  their  natural  polish?— 
that  it  opens  the  way  for  gum  troubles  as 
serious  as  gingivitis,  Vincent's  disease, 
and  even  pyorrhea? — that  it  endangers 
sound  teeth? 

Do  this :  Clean  your  teeth  with  Ipana 


Tooth  Paste.  But  each  time,  rub  a  little 
extra  Ipana  right  into  those  unhealthy 
gums  of  yours.  The  ziratol  in  Ipana,  with 
the  massage,  sends  fresh  blood  speeding 
through  the  gums,  and  helps  to  firm  them 
back  to  health. 

Start  in  today  with  this  Ipana  regime. 
Your  teeth  will  be  so  much  whiter  and 
brighter!  And  if  you'll  keep  using  Ipana 
with  massage,  you  won't  have  to  give  a 
thought  to  "pink  tooth  brush."  You'll 
be  rid  of  it!

When  the  audience  speaks  the  stars  and  producers  listen.  We  offer  three  prizes  for  the 
best  letters  of  the  month  -$25,  $10  and  $5.  Literary  ability  doesn't  count.  But  candid 
opinions  and  constructive  suggestions  do.  We  must  reserve  the  right  to  cut  letters  to 
suit  space  limitations.    Address  The  Editor,  PHOTOPLAY,  221  W.  57th  St,  New  York  City. 


"There's  a  lesson  for  every  woman  and  every  man  in  'Back  Street,'  " 
says  one  reader  in  a  Bouquet  letter.  "John  Boles  and  Irene  Dunne 
made  the  Walter  and  Ray  of  Fannie  Hurst's  great  novel  seem  vivid 
human  beings,  whose  weaknesses  and  strength  I  could  understand" 


THE  $25  LETTER 

Time  goes  on,  and  once  the  thoughts  of  life's 
evening  filled  me  with  dread.  I  knew  what  it 
brought,  for  I  had  seen  my  mother  when  its 
shadows  began  to  lengthen  over  her.  Her  work 
had  been  finished;  her  brood  of  children  raised 
and  in  homes  of  their  own.  Before  her  lay  the 
wait  for  death  with  nothing  to  fill  it  hut 
memories.  The  children  had  taken  the  best 
years  of  her  life  and  left  only  reminiscences. 
And  endless  recollection  soon  merged  into 
senility. 

Time  swept  on.  I  became  a  wife — mother — 
widow — grandmother.  Do  I  live  with  mem- 
ories?  No!  Around  the  corner  is  a  little  movie 
house.  Each  night  I  wash  and  dry  my 
dishes,  put  on  my  hat  and  make  a  bee-line  for 
it.  Within  those  two  hours  I  satisfy  not  only 
the  beauty  and  romance  I  have  been  denied, 
but  also  the  beauty  and  romance  denied  to  my 
mother  and  my  grandmother.  The  vitality  of 
the  talkies  sustains  me.  With  all  of  the  sin- 
cerity  which  my  eighty  years  are  cap- 
able of.  I  thank  the  movies  for  making  this 
pause  between  the  end  of  one  job  and  the 
beginning  of  another  so  pleasant. 

Mrs.  Annie  Cather,  Charlottesville,  Va. 

THE  $10  LETTKK 

We're  a  bridge  club  of  twelve  girls,  and  over 
the  refreshments  we  discuss  the  screen  stars. 
We  think,  for  instance: 

That  we'd  enjoy  the  movies  just  as  much  if 
Garbo  stayed  home. 

That  Joan  Crawford  has  a  perfect  right  to 
experiment  with  her  make-up;  it's  her  mouth 

6 


and  her  own  affair  if  she  wants  to  make  it 
bigger. 

That  the  most  interesting  couple  in  Holly- 
wood is  Dolores  Del  Rio  and  Cedric  Gibbons — 
we  could  go  for  Cedric  ourselves. 

That  if  Gary  Cooper  (our  favorite)  goes 
snooty  we'll  just  change  over  without  any 
trouble  to  John  Wayne. 


BESIDES  winning  the  $25  prize, 
Mrs.  Annie  Cather's  letter  must 
win  all  hearts  this  month.  Of  the 
hundreds  of  interesting  and  sincere 
letters  that  come  to  us  daily,  hers 
is  one  of  the  loveliest  tributes  to  the 
screen.  Here's  wishing  you  many 
more  happy  movie  hours,  Grandma 
Cather! 

What  an  eloquent  and  often 
amusing  exchange  of  ideas  there 
are.  Pro  and  con  opinions  are 
rampant  on  such  films  as  "Horse 
Feathers,"  "Strange  Interlude," 
"Life  Begins"  and  "Love  Me  To- 
night." "Back  Street"  brought 
nothing  but  praise,  and  "The  Age 
of  Consent"  got  a  huge  vote  because 
of  its  sincere  treatment  of  a  vital 
subject.  "Bird  of  Paradise"  was 
lauded  "because  it  is  different." 

Plenty  of  posies  for  players,  too, 
with  big  red  roses  for  the  "glamour 
girls,"  headed  bv  Garbo.  And  just 
wait  until  you  see  the  newest  ex- 
ponent, Katharine  Hepburn,  in  "A 
Bill  of  Divorcement"  (reviewed  in 
this  issue). 


That  Constance  Bennett  begins  to  see  the 
error  of  too  much  iciness  and  has  begun  to  melt 
slightly — we  go  to  see  all  of  her  pictures,  but 
she  never  displaces  Joan  for  a  minute. 

That  Karen  Morley,  Kay  Johnson  and 
Peggy  Shannon  are  actresses. 

That  in  spite  of  her  fine  acting,  something's 
happened  to  Norma  Shearer;  none  of  us  like 
her  as  well  as  we  did. 

That  Ken  Murray  in  "Crooner"  is  better 
than  Gable  ever  was. 

That  H.  B.  Warner  is  every  thing— plus. 

That  we'd  like  to  see  Joan  Crawford  and 
Gary  Cooper  play  together  in  a  picture  similar 
to  "Bad  Girl" — a  normal,  healthy  young 
couple,  no  neurotics  or  psychoses,  just  life,  love 
and  a  couple  of  babies  maybe. 

Louise  Trost,  Jersey  City,  N.  J. 

THE  $5  LETTER 

May  I  speak  as  an  advocate  of  the  "shady 
dames"  that  some  of  the  other  readers  seem  to 
scorn?  I  should  just  hate  to  see  Marlene 
Dietrich,  Garbo  or  Constance  Bennett  playing 
sweet  little  innocents,  even  if  they  could '  We 
have  come  to  associate  them  with  such  fine 
films  as  "Shanghai  Express,"  "Mata  Hari" 
and  "  Bought,"  and  we  want  to  keep  right  on 
seeing  them  in  the  same  sort  of  colorful  roles. 

If  all  the  heroines  turn  goody-goody,  I  shall 
have  to  take  my  modest  shilling  to  church! 
Dilyes  Dixgle,  Portsmouth,  England. 

'STRANGE  INTERLUDE" 

I  think  that  "Strange  Interlude"  is  one  of 
the  finest  pictures  I  have  ever  seen.  First 
honors  should  go  to  Eugene  O'Neill  and  the 
producers  who  had  courage  and  foresight 
enough  to  attempt  an  experimental  picture. 
The  masterful  performances  of  the  cast  leave 
nothing  to  be  desired. 

We  need  more  pictures  like  this  one.  They 
add  new  color  to  a  film  industry  whose  coat  at 
times  seems  very  drab. 

D.  Oliver  Merrell,  Lake  City,  Minn. 

Why  was  Clark  Gable  chosen  for  the  part  of 
the  doctor  in  "Strange  Interlude"?  Any  one 
of  a  dozen  able  actors  could  have  carried  it 
off  to  much  greater  advantage — men  with 
grace,  charm  and  subtlety — he  is  not  the  type. 
He  did  not  age  gracefully. 

Norma  Shearer  does  a  charming  piece  of 
work  until  her  son  is  graduated  from  the 
university,  at  the  age,  let  us  say,  of  twenty- 
two.  What  need  for  his  handsome  mother, 
who  took  life  very  calmly  after  she  decided  not 
to  take  her  lover  or  her  husband  seriously,  to 
make  up  old  enough  to  be  her  son's  grand- 
mother ? 

She  wrecked  an  otherwise  fine  portrait  by 
suddenly  becoming  old,  decrepit  and  too 
utterly  silly  for  words. 

Women  like  Nina  do  not  grow  old  quite  that 
way— they  get  every  care  and  even  ride  over 
others  to  get  it.  Her  ghastly  experience  in 
her  youth  made  her  harsh  and  indifferent 
later  on.  and  she  would  no  longer  permit  things 
to  grieve  her.  She  was  the  object  of  much  love 
and  devotion.  People  like  that  age  late  and 
gracefully. 

Nel  M.  Lurrie 

I  don't  think  Clark  Gable's  role  in  "  Strange 
Interlude"  was  suited  to  his  type,  but  the  fact 
that  he  made  it  so  believable  is  a  great  tribute 
to  his  acting  ability. 

And  one  of  your  writers  said  recently  that 
he  isn't  versatile!

WHAT  A  FATAL  BLUNDER!  Shopping 
for  days  for  the  perfect  gown— then 
spoiling  its  whole  effect  by  neglected 
hands.  Hands  so  red,  so  rough — people 
instantly  pictured  her  scrubbing  floors. 

No  matter  how  much  housework  your 
hands  do — no  matter  how  often  they 
are  in  and  out  of  water — they  needn't 
show  it.  Imagine  washing  your  face 
twenty  times  a  day  —  in  hot,  harsh, 
soapy  water,  too.  Then  you'll  understand 
how  dishwashing,  cleaning,  preparing 
vegetables  rob  hands  of  natural  skin 
oils,  make  them  rough  and  red. 

But  now  every  woman — whether 
housewife  or  business  woman — can 
easily  put  back  these  precious,  hand- 
beautifying  oils.  Simply  smooth  on 
Hinds  Honey  and  Almond  Cream  after 
hands  have  been  in  water,  and  regularly 
every  night.  Feel  its  cooling,  soothing 
action  start  at  once.  Watch  hands  grow 
softer,  whiter— redness,  roughness  fade 
before  your  very  eyes!  Every  ugly  trace

of  work  will  be  gone  in  three  days.  Con- 
tinue to  use  Hinds  regularly  —  keep 
hands  looking  their  loveliest. 

Chiffon-weight 
— not  a  gummy  jelly 

Do  not  confuse  Hinds  with  thick,  gum- 
my jellies  which  may  contain  exces- 
sive drying  substances  which  dry  the 
hands,  too.  Hinds  dries  naturally.  It  is 
a  chiffon- weight  cream,  so  delicate  in 
texture,  it  seems  to  melt  right  into  pores. 
Just  a  few  seconds  and  it's  absorbed, 
leaving  an  invisible  "second  skin"  that 
protects  the  hands. 

Try  Hinds  FREE 

Mail  coupon  at  right  for  a  generous  7- 
day  trial  bottle  of  Hinds.  Just  a  few 


applications  will  make  your  hands  soft, 
smooth,  sheer- white.  Of  course,  to  keep 
them  lovely  you  must  use  it  regularly 
— every  night  and  daily  after  any  skin- 
roughening  task.  Directions  for  a  Hinds

"Bird  of  Paradise"  seems  to  be  the  "something  different"  that  the 
folks  have  been  asking  for.  "Scenery  like  that  is  alone  worth  the  price

GREAT  EXPECTATIONS 

With  one,  two  and  even  three  screen  lumi- 
naries on  each  vaudeville  stage  in  town,  we 
are  getting  very  blase  and  soon  may  refuse  to

"BACK  STREET" 

I  have  just  seen  "Back  Street"  and  am 
writing  at  once  while  every  beautiful  detail  is 
fresh  in  my  mind.  Unlike  most  stories  of  un- 
conventional love,  it  lacks  the  unsavory  taste 
usually  left  in  one's  mouth.  There  was  not  one 
incident  that  the  most  Puritanic  person  could 
resent. 

Irene  Dunne  and  John  Holes  were  superb 
in  their  roles  of  Ray  and  Walter. 

Sara  Kirk,  Miami,  Fla. 

'•  Hack  Street"  is  an  eloquent  story  of  the 

heart.

J  U.K.   HOLT 

That  interview  with  Jack  Holt  in  your  Sep- 
tember number  was  worth  all  the  money  I've 
-pent  for  Photopl  w  in  the  past  live  years;  and 
I  read  it  regularly.  Jack  is  grand — the  most 
compelling  male  personality  on  the  screen 
today,  and  what  an  actor!  I  lis  performance 
in  "War  Correspondent"  was  magnificent. 
M.  I.  Kelly,  Edmonton,  Alberta,  Can. 

FUEL  ECONOMY 

Why  not  Joan  Crawford  and  Clark  Cable  in 
a  talkie  version  of  "The  Sheik"?    Joan  would 


make  a  lovely  Diane  and  it  does  not  require  a 
great  stretch  of  the  imagination  to  envision 
Gable  in  the  role  of  the  masterful  sheik,  which 
Valentino  so  ably  portrayed. 

What  splendid  entertainment  for  a  cold 
winter's  evening! 

Mrs.  C.  R.  Gilmore,  Xiantic,  Conn. 

ONE'S  GOOD,  ANYHOW 

In  my  adolescence,  I  used  to  invest  movie 
stars  with  glamour. 

I  had  my  favorites,  and  how  jealously  I  de- 
fended them! 

There  was  no  one  just  as  good  as  Charlie 
Chaplin,  nor  so  swell  a  guy  as  Charlie  Ray. 

But  I  grew  up  (try  to  convince  my  wife, 
though)  and  came  West,  met  a  heap  of  the 
biggest  stars,  looked  behind  the  scenes,  and 
watched   movies  in   the  making. 

And  all  my  viewpoints  on  motion  pictures 
changed. 

The  picture  became  the  thing,  the  actor  im- 
portant only  in  interpreting  his  role. 

All  this  clamor  and  tierce  fanfare  over  the 
stars! 

It  seems  so  childish,  when  we  know  blamed 
well,  or  should,  that  actors  may  come,  and 
actors  may  go,  but  the  movies  keep  right  on 
getting  better,  constantly  improving. 

To  heck  with  "stars" — but  I  do  sorta  like 
Fredric  March!

"LOVE  Ml.  TONIGHT" 

Maurice  Chevalier  in  "Love  Me  Tonight" 
is  the  best  entertainment  the  movies  have 
offered  since  that  other  charming  musical  Para- 
mount picture,  "This  Is  The  Night."  I  hope 
producers  will  give  us  more  of  this  type  of 
picture,  for  the  fight  musical  and,  yes,  even  the 
spiced  touch  in  these  films  make  them  a  great 
relief  from  some  of  the  overdone  and  heavy 
dramatic  stuff. 

Hob  Adams,  Northeast  Harbor,  Me. 


SPANKS  FOB  MM  RICE 

Why  spoil  a  musical  treat  like  "Love  Me  To- 
night" with  such  questionable  lyrics  and  lines 
that  even  the  most  sophisticated  must  blush? 
For  shame,  Monsieur  Chevalier!  Risque? — 
yes.  that  you  can  be  and,  somehow  or  other,  we 
don't  mind  it  from  you.  But  vulgar? — not 
even  your  magnetic  smile  can  make  us  over- 
look that.

"THE  AGE  OF  CONSENT" 

I  found  us — my  school  friends  and  I — in 
"The  Age  of  Consent,"  living  and  acting  just 
as  we  act,  troubled  by  the  problems  that  cause 
us  distress,  and  loving  as  we  love.  Why  can't 
pictures  always  portray  us  as  we  are? — a  little 
puzzled,  sometimes  daring,  but  always  very 
sincere.  Youth  is  only  the  beginning;  it  is  age 
and  experience  that  make  people  artificial. 
Edith  E.  Clark,  Kewaskum,  Wis. 

"The  Age  of  Consent,"  which  I  have  just 
seen  for  the  second  time,  and  with  immense 
pleasure,  strikes  me  as  being  timely  and  re- 
freshing in  the  extreme.  Having  lived  for  many 
years  in  immediate  proximity  to  state  univer- 
sities, my  judgment  of  collegiate  details  is 
acute. 

The  ability  of  Richard  Cromwell  in  the  role 
of  the  idealistic  and  somewhat  bewildered  stu- 
dent never  showed  to  more  splendid  advan- 
tage, and  a  dozen  times  during  the  show  my 
eyes  filled  with  tears,  so  clean-cut,  sincere  and 
vital  was  the  drama.  Arlene  Judge  registered 
gallantly  in  the  waitress  scenes,  but  her  voice 
seemed  strident  and  forced  at  the  climax.  The 
gentleman  who  impersonated  the  father  rose 
to  great  heights  of  convincing  Puritanic  ire, 
and  the  acting  of  Dorothy  Wilson  was  ade- 
quate, if  not  inspired.  Eric  Linden  proved 
amusing.

ASK  DOUG,  HE  KNOWS 

It's  wonderful.  It's  grand.  It's  unique  love- 
making,  but  it  thrills. 

What?     "Mr.  Robinson  Crusoe,"  the  pic- 
ture all  my  friends  are  talking  about.    But  we 
all  wonder  if  the  radio  really  worked. 
L.  Orange  Kendall,  Williamsport,  Penna. 

BIG  BOY  BARRYMORE 

"  The  Washington  Masquerade  "  is  a  fine  pic- 
ture with  a  splendid  cast,  but  it  all  fades  into 
the  background  beside  the  acting  of  Lionel 
Barrymore. 

I  have  seen  many  stage  plays  here  and 
abroad,  but  Lionel's  acting  beggars  praise.  He 
is  simply  magnificent.

BUT  LIFE  IS  LIKE  THAT 

Sometimes  I  wonder  why  certain  set  situa- 
tions are  used  again  and  again.  For  instance, 
there  is  a  dramatic  quarrel  between  lovers,  or 
husband  and  wife,  mother  and  son  or  father 
and  daughter.  The  battle  always  reaches  its 
climax  with  the  male  member  of  the  duo  leav- 
ing in  a  huff,  slamming  the  door  loudly  behind 
him.     Upon  which,  the  deserted  woman  inva- 


And  Players  with  what  Others  Think 


riably  hesitates  uncertainly  for  a  moment,  then 
crying  "Otto!"  (or  Tony,  or  Algernon,  or  Ig- 
natz,  as  the  case  may  be),  runs  to  the  door  and 
leans  against  it  sobbing  as  if  her  little  heart 
would  break. 

In  my  many  evenings  at  the  local  picture 
house  I  have  seen  this  little  act  done  by  every 
screen  beauty  from  Ruth  Chatterton  to  Minnie 
Mouse.  And  I'm  a-gittin'  kinda  fed  up.  Some 
day  I  hope  to  see  a  picture  in  which  the  dame 
actually  opens  the  door  and  goes  after  the  flee- 
ing male — and  either  socks  him  a  fast  one  or 
gives  him  her  best  soul  kiss,  whatever  the 
situation  seems  to  call  for.

DODGE  THAT  BRICKBAT 

I  have  slept  overnight  on  this  matter,  to  try 
and  write  you  as  calmly  as  possible,  but  that 
is  impossible.  What  has  roused  my  ire  is  the 
Photoplay  article  "The  Garbo  Jinx."  All 
Novarro  fans  must  deplore  "Mata  Hari"  and 
seeing  this  glorious  artist  thrown  away  in  a 
small  part — but  was  it  his  fault?  He  appeared 
in  exactly  four  scenes,  if  I  remember  rightly. 
As  a  matter  of  fact,  however,  one  of  the  most 
important  writers  in  London  said  that  No- 
varro's  was  the  only  real  live  performance  in 
"Mata  Hari"  and  that  Garbo  and  Barrymore 
were  but  puppets! 

The  Photoplay  writer  says  that  Novarro 
hurt  Garbo's  film.  Ye  gods!  What  about 
hurting  Novarro's  own  artistic  reputation!  Is 
Garbo  the  only  thing  that  matters?  Novarro 
— a  star  for  eleven  years — doesn't  he  matter? 
Here's  a  glorious  and  versatile  artist — witness 
" Scaramouche, "  "The  Arab,"  "Ben  Hur, " 
"The  Student  Prince,"  "The  Pagan,"  "The 
Call  of  the  Flesh, "  etc.  Doesn't  he  deserve 
some  decent  material?

GORILLAS  VS.  GANGSTERS 

Hats  off  to  Frank  Buck  and  the  Martin 
Johnsons!  Gangland's  shootings  and  whole- 
sale murders  only  leave  us  disgusted  and  naus- 
eated. It  takes  war  among  the  jungle  animals 
to  give  us  a  real  thrill. 

The  graceful  tread  of  the  tiger  and  panthers 
with  their  fascinatingly  wary  eyes  shoves  the 
wiles  of  our  sophisticated  stars  in  the  back- 
ground. The  "killer"  following  the  scent  of  a 
lost  baby  elephant  holds  more  suspense  than 
a  half  dozen  villains  lying  in  wait  for  the  hero- 
ine. 

Louise  C.  Brey,  Milwaukee,  WTis. 

THERE'S  ONLY  FOUR 

Give  us  more  of  the  national  gloom-chasers — 
the  four  Marx  Brothers,  the  screen's  superb 
comedians. 

Marie  Vacalis,  Mobile,  Ala. 

I've  just  seen  the  four  Marx  Brothers  in 
"Horse  Feathers,"  and  boy,  was  it  funny! 
With  my  laugh  I  was  surprised  they  didn't 
throw  me  out.  The  goofiest  picture  I  ever 
saw.    Give  us  more. 

Tex  Schaefer,  East  Rutherford,  N.  J. 

WELL,  WE  KNOW  WHERE  THEY 
STARTED 

Herewith  one  brickbat  for  "  Horse  Feathers," 
which  I  have  just  seen.  And  here  is  the  why 
of  the  brickbat. 

One  evening,  after  Adam  and  Eve  had  been 
out  of  the  Garden  for  a  few  years,  he  read  to 
her  some  vulgar  lines  which  he  had  found  in 
the  palm  of  his  hand.  Eve  repeated  the  lines 
to  some  friends,  while  they  were  sewing  the 
next  day,  thus  giving  the  lines  a  good  running 


Jeanette  MacDonald  and  Maurice  Chevalier  in  "Love  Me  Tonight" 
brought  down  the  house  with  their  music  and  charm.  But  many  readers 
begged  Maurice  to  stick  to  the  double  entendre,  if  he  must,  but  to  be 
less  frankly  naughty.    Director  Mamoulian  got  high  praise  for  his  work 


start  out  into  the  world.  For  several  centuries 
thereafter  the  lines  were  repeated  throughout 
various  Asiatic  dynasties,  they  getting  a  little 
nastier  with  each  dynasty.  In  time,  the  Greeks 
were  spreading  the  lines,  and  it  was  because 
he  repeated  them  that  the  mother  of  Demos- 
thenes made  him  wash  out  his  mouth  with 
soapstone  pebbles  every  day.  Then  the  Ro- 
mans got  them  and  told  them  everywhere. 
Next,  they  were  quite"  rife  in  the  court  of  the 
great  Louis  of  France,  and  getting  rifer  and 
riper  with  each  telling.  Eventually  the  lines 
came  to  America  and  about  1894  they  were  in 
quite  general  circulation  here,  but  were  usually 
told  out  behind  the  barn. 

But  now,  in  1932,  Groucho  Marx  in  "Horse 
Feathers"  repeats  the  modern  version  of  those 
same  vulgar  lines  which  Adam  read  to  Eve. 
Which  makes  one  realize  what  little  progress 
Good  Taste  has  made  in  this  world  since  human 
life  began. 

Fred  B.  Mann,  Chicago,  111. 

"BIRD  OF  PARADISE" 

Congratulations  to  the  producers  and  cast 
of  "  Bird  of  Paradise. "  It  is  the  most  beautiful 
picture  I  have  ever  seen. 

Its  poignant  portrayal  of  true  love  and  sac- 
rifice, its  bits  of  tender  romance,  together  with 
the  perfect  sound  accompaniments  and  scen- 
ery, combine  to  make  it  a  perfect  picture.  In 
this  age  of  stereotyped  productions,  it  soars 
aloft. 

Margaret  Scott,  Milwaukee,  Wis. 

My  girl  friend  and  I  went  to  see  "Bird  of 
Paradise,"  and  I  frankly  admit  that  before 
entering  the  theater  we  both  felt  bored  with 
life. 

That  picture,  with  its  beautiful  scenery 
of  Hawaii,  portraying  real  natives  and  their 
customs,  left  us  feeling  refreshed  and  that  after 
all  this  is  a  lovely  world. 

We  who  work  in  stuffy  offices,  come  home  to 
crowded  quarters,  and  rarely,  if  ever,  are  able 


to  spend  time  in  the  country,  certainly  do  ap- 
preciate this  type  of  picture,  for  nature  is  won- 
derful! 

L.  C.  Morstein,  Baltimore,  Md. 

LAUGHING  TO  PROSPERITY 

Oh  boy,  what  a  laugh  "Down  to  Earth"  is! 
Homer  Croy  never  wrote  a  funnier  story,  and 
Irene  Rich  is  rich  indeed.  Talk  about  "de- 
pression ointment " — Will  Rogers  surely  has 
found  a  cure. 

Florena  A.  Hayler,  San  Diego,  Calif. 

"LIFE  BEGINS" 

Here  is  the  delicate  subject  of  childbirth, 
handled  with  such  good  taste  that  its  theme 
never  becomes  offensive.  Eric  Linden,  as  the 
harassed  young  husband,  and  Aline  MacMa- 
hon,  as  the  understanding  nurse,  are  charac- 
terizations that  will  remain  in  my  memory  for- 
ever. 

Clara  Kistner,  San  Francisco,  Calif. 

In  my  opinion,  a  picture  like  "Life  Begins," 
laid  in  a  maternity  ward,  should  be  shown  only 
to  medical  students  and  to  nurses  in  training. 
Such  clinical  subjects  are  not  fit  for  mixed 
audiences  of  men  and  women,  and  worse  still, 
young  people.  I  admit  that  the  story  was  skil- 
fully handled  and  beautifully  played,  but  I 
still  insist  that  such  films  are  unjustified.  Why 
waste  fine  actors  on  pictures  that  don't  interest 
us? 

Thomas  T.  Johnson,  New  York  City 

AN  OPINION 

All-star  casts  leave  me  with  a  feeling  of  dis- 
satisfaction. It  is  so  much  more  satisfying  to 
have  our  fill  of  Joan  Crawford  one  evening,  of 
Garbo  the  next,  etc.,  than  to  take  them  all  in 
one  gulp. 

Margaret  Morales,  Tampa,  Fla.

The  Audience  Speaks  Up 


i  I  ON  HM  1.1)  FROM  PACE    15  | 


The  Photoplay  story  about  Jack  Holt 
brought  a  volley  of  enthusiastic  letters. 
"New  stars  may  come  and  go,"  writes  one 
woman,  "but  Holt  is  still  Jack  of  Hearts 
in  our  family."  Here  he  is  with  Lila  Lee 
in  a  scene   from    "War    Correspondent" 


A  Photoplay  writer  said  recently  that 
Ramon  Novarro  was  not  at  his  best  in 
"Mata  Hari" — and  the  smoke  of  battle 
has  not  yet  died  away.  His  admirers 
bombarded  us  with  bitter  letters,  saying 
his  scenes  with  Garbo  were  all  too  brief 


YOU  PICK  THE  STARS 

I  wonder  just  how  long  the  producers  are 
going  to  push  these  carbon  copies  of  Garbo  on 
I  hey  import  these  players  from  Europe 
and  immediately  put  them  in  starring  roles. 
The  public  does  not  like  this.  We  like  to  make 
our  own  stars  by  popular  acclaim. 

Yvonne  Lassus,  Oyster  Bay,  L.  I. 

OUR  FOREIGN  FRIENDS 

My  age  is  sixteen.  We  learn  English  in 
high  school  and  my  friends  and  I  desire  more 
knowledge  of  foreign  habits  and  conversation. 
We  therefore  go  very  usually  to  Hollywood 
talkie  and  read  Photoplay  magazine.  The 
language  of  Photoplay  is  very  understandable 
and  very  eagerly  I  read  articles  concerning 
splendid  actors,  fashions,  diets  and  other 
things  that  have  very  pleasant  lesson. 

Kiku  Arita,  Kobe,  Japan 

Try  giving  Garbo  a  few  bad  stories  and  a 
few  inferior  directors  and  see  where  she  would 
be.  She  is  just  getting  what  you  call  over 
there  "a  lucky  break."  I  am  sure  that  the 
time  will  come  when  the  director's  name  will 
lie  in  electric  lights  and  not  that  of  the  star. 
.Mrs.  Olive  Leigh,  Devon,  England 

Lots  of  us  over  here  are  interested  in  John 
Miljan  and  are  looking  forward  to  seeing  him 
again  soon.  I  am  wondering  why  Other  fans 
seem  to  have  overlooked  him.  Hasn't  anyone 
else  noticed  just  how  attractive  he  is? 

Ona  Btjekley,  Brussels,  Belgium 

Here  is  my  advice  to  fans:  When  you  see  a 
picture  which  does  not  meet  with  your  ap- 
proval, just  think  hack  to  the  last  picture  you 
enjoyed  and  hi-  thankful  that  the  percentage  of 
entertaining  pictures  is  so  high. 

Erie  E\  ins,  Victoria,  Australia 

Technically,  the  films  are  unbeatable.  They 
are,  in  fact,  one  of  the  seven  modern  wonders 

/'; 


of  the  world.     But  from  the  story  standpoint 
they're  sick  and  badly  need  the  doctor. 

J.  M.  Cameron,  Winnipeg,  Canada 

Here  Garbo,  Dietrich  and  Chevalier  are  most 
popular.  But  I  think  Joan  Crawford  and  Clark 
Gable  are  great,  too. 

Ulli  Torxroos,  Helsingfors,  Finland 

Why  should  movie  stars  change  their  names 
and  deprive  their  parents  of  the  joy  of  seeing 
the  family  name  in  a  high  artistic  place? 

Carlos  Victorixo,  Jr.,  Manila,  P.  I. 

RANDOM  REMARKS 

Is  anything  more  disappointing  than,  filled 
with  anticipation,  to  attend  the  movie  version 
of  your  favorite  book,  only  to  find  it  has  been 
altered  beyond  recognition  on  the  screen? 

Mrs.  Johx  Sherwood,  Omaha,  Xeb. 

Dick  Arlen  is  neither  a  tough  guy  nor  a  sissy. 
Xo  matter  what  role  he  is  given  he  does  it 
perfectly.  He  is  a  regular  fellow  with  that 
something  that  makes  people  like  him. 

Lillian  Stro.hff,  Chicago,  111. 

Joan  Bennett  is,  in  my  opinion,  a  greater 
actress  than  either  her  famous  sister,  Connie, 
or  the  great  Garbo.  She  has  more  emotional 
power  and  beauty  than  either  of  them. 

Helen  Bowman,  Cape  Girardeau,  Mo. 

All  the  glamour,  sophistication,  loveliness 
and  what  have  you  that  Crawford,  Shearer  and 
Garbo  have  is  wrapped  up  in  one  cute  bundle 
and  called  Sylvia  Sidney. 

Ori'hii   Gahelgard,  Minneapolis,  Minn. 

Last  year  I  taught  English  in  a  small  town 
school,  and  was  faced  with  the  problem  of  in- 
teresting rural  youngsters  in  literature  far 
beyond  their  sphere.  It  would  have  been  an 
impossible  task  without  the  moving  pictures 
shown  four  nights  a  week  in  our  tiny  picture 


The  Westerns  were  a  blessing,  for  they 
stimulated  enthusiasm  for  Owen  Wister's  "The 
Virginian." 

And  oh,  those  newsreels  and  travelogues! 
My  appreciation  was  as  nothing  compared  to 
the  wonder  and  delight  of  the  children,  whose 
lives  are  so  barren. 

I  sometimes  wonder  if  the  men  who  are  re- 
sponsible for  travelogues  realize  how  they  are 
enriching  the  lives  of  rural  people. 

These  pictures  are  creating  dreams  for  the 
hard-working  adults  and  offering  challenges  to 
the  children. 

Muriel  Mac  Lean,  Buffalo,  X.  V. 

DISAPPROVES  OF  SHADY  DAMES 

Why  is  there  such  a  prevalence  of  "slightly 
shopworn"  heroines  in  the  current  films?  I 
have  gone  through  the  reviews  of  all  the  best 
pictures  in  several  issues  of  Photoplay  and  by 
actual  count  the  majority  are  of  this  type. 
Surely  a  majority  of  American  women  are  not 
immoral. 

Vet  a  foreigner,  seeing  these  pictures,  would 
certainly  think  they  must  be. 

Don't  think  from  this  that  I'm  a  gossipping 
old  maid,  for  I'm  not — I'm  very  young  and 
quite  modern. 

These  pictures  don't  shock  me.  But  I  think 
that,  with  a  few  exceptions,  they  do  not  present 
a  true  picture  of  modern  life. 

Can't  a  girl  be  pretty  and  popular  without 
indulging  in  drinking  bouts  and  petting 
parties? 

Can't  a  woman  be  clever  and  alluring  with- 
out a  shady  past?    I  think  she  can. 

Aka  Treadwei.l,  Uvalde,  Texas 

How  long  is  this  affliction  of  fallen  heroines 
to  last5 

They  leave  a  bad  taste  regardless  of  superb 
performances! 

Give  me  romance,  womanly  sophistication, 
and  a  dash  .  .  .  ah,  yes,  just  a  dash  ...  of 
sex  in  pictures.

LEARNS    WHY     OLD     STOCKINGS     DIE    YOONG 


ADVERTISER'S    NOTE 

like  many  other  women,  Miss  Chatterton  has  been 
hearing  a  good  deal  lately  aboul  "fresh  Silk  Stock- 
ings," but  she  didn't  really  know  how  much  better 
they  are.  In  this  series  of  Questions  and  Answers, 
this  charming  star  learns  what's  behind  all  the  talk. 


MISS  CHATTERTON'S  QUESTION:  What  do  you 
mean  —  fresh  silk  stockings? 

OUR  ANSWER:  The  same  as  fresh  anything  .  .  . 
young,  new,  lively,  more  beautiful. 

Q:  But  what  difference  does  that  make  in  stockings? 

A :  Just  this  —  old-silk  stockings  lose  their  pep  in 
the  fight  against  runs.  They  don't  "come  back" 
as  vigorously  after  laundering.  They  don't  stand 
the  strain;  don't  cling  smoothly  or  fit  so  well. 

Q:  If  Fresh  Silk  Stockings  are  such  a  grand  idea, 
why  doesn't  everybody  sell  them? 

A:  Distribution  methods  are  too  complicated. 
Stockings  go  through  so  many  channels,  and 
lie  so  long  on  shelves,  you're  never  sure  how 
old  they  really  are. 

Q:  How  do;o//  people  manage  to  be  so  clever? 

A:  We  don't  sell  through  stores.  Our  stockings 
go  straight  from  the  mills  to  you — no  stops  or 
Lay-overs  en  route.  Take  this  pair  —  just  a  few 
days  ago  they  were  a  skein  of  silk — now  they're 
stockings.  And  not  long  before  that  they  were 
cocoons.  And  remember,  fresh  silk  is  just  one 
of  Realsilk's  seven  exclusive  features. 

— And  that's  how  Miss  Chatterton  learned  why  old 
stockings  die  young  and  fresh  stockings  live  longer

loss  and  Hollywood's  gain.  "The  Rich  Are  Always  With  Us"  added  to

NOW  who  would  think  that  this  dramatic  young  woman  was 
once  an  unsophisticated  little  colleen?    The  truth  is  that  Maureen

A  failure  in  sweet,  ga-ga  parts,  she  suddenly  burst  forth  with  screen

When  she  isn't  raving  about  the  baby,  Miriam  finds  time  to  turn  in

AT  a  moderate  price,  Skinner  offers  this  new  and  epoch- 
-*■  •*»  making  dress  fabric.  It  is  for  those  countless  women 
who  are  saying  "Never  again!"  as  the  result  of  buying 
unnamed  silks  that  were  cheap  in  price,  but  which  they 
found  had  no  wearing  quality. 

The  wearer  of  such  fabrics,  whose  misfortune  it  is  to 
have  them  split  or  "pull"  at  the  seams,  realizes  that  they 
are  really  more  expensive  than  she  can  afford. 

Skinner's  Troubleproof  Crepe  is  woven  in  a  new  way. 
It  is  slip-proof— made  of  specially-twisted  threads  of  fine 
silk,  which  give  it  amazing  strength  and  wearing  quality. 
It  is  priced  within  reach  of  everyone— and  is  striking  evi- 
dence that  by  paying  just  a  few  cents  more  per  yard  you 
can  obtain  silks  in  which  you  can  have  absolute  confidence.

I  Why  you  must  have  .sugar  to  lose 
weight  faster,   and    more    safely  1 


Out  here  in  Hollywood,  I've  slapped, 
beaten,  pounded  .  .  .  and  dieted  .  .  .  many 
an  overweight  picture  star  into  shape  for 
the  camera.  And  in  New  York,  many  a 
stage  and  social  celebrity.  I  get  $100  a 
half  hour  for  doing  it. 

Now  these  Life  Savers  folks  have  asked 
me  to  tell  you  about  my  slenderizing 
method,  because  Life  Savers  are  part  of 
that  method.  We'll  get  back  to  them  later 
I  want  to  tell  you,  in  proper  order,  the 
things  you've  got  to  do  to  get  rid  of  those 
bulges,  bumps  and  rubber  tires.  I  don't 
believe  in  shilly-shallying.  And  I'm  going 
to  give  you  my  advice  straight  from  the 
shoulder.  If  you're  a  sensitive  creature 
.  .  .  that's  just  too  bad. 

FIRST:  Exercise  sanely.  A  two-mile  (or 
more)  walk  a  day  in  the  open  air. 


SECOND:  No  fat,  rich  foods,  gravies  or 
sauces.  And  liquor?  Don't  let  me  catch 
you  taking  a  drop! 

THIRD:  Here's  where  you  get  the  sur- 
prise of  your  life.  You'll  think  it's  a  mis- 
print. But  it  isn't.  Get  this  straight.  Don't 
starve  yourself  on  sugar! 

Eat  enough  Sugar! 

Fats  are  fuel;  sugar  is  the  flame.  Sugar 
is  the  one  food  element  that  most  quickly 
and  most  safely  burns  away  the  body  fats. 
And  you'll  lose  weight  faster  with  the 
right  sweet  at  the  right  time  than  you 
ever  could  without  it. 

Case  after  case  of  my  own  verifies  these 
facts. 

What  is  the  right  sweet?  1  give  Life  Savers 
to  my  clients.  I  don't  let  my  stars  suffer 
from  the  pangs  of  a  normal  sweets-hunger. 
I  satisfy  it  .  .  .  and  help  them  reduce  at 
the  same  time. 

Why  are  Life  Savers  part  of  my  slender- 
izing method?  Because  they  are  a  pur- 
poseful candy  for  reducing.  They  give  you 
quickly  assimilated  sugar  energy  without 
fat-producing  bulk.  They  are  hard,  so  you 
let  them  dissolve  on  your  tongue.  One 
Life  Saver  lasts  8  to  10  minutes.  And 
gives  you  a  lasting  gratification  of  your 
normal  hunger  for  sweets.  You  can  slip 
one  into  your  mouth  whenever  and  wher- 
ever you  like.  And  as  often  as  your  appe- 
tite calls  for  sugar. 

Even  the  most  finicky  palate  can  find  a 
flavor  it  likes,  because  there  are  many  to 
choose  from.  Myself,  I  like  Cryst-<  >- 
mints,  the  new  mouth-cooling,  crystal 
drops.  But  you  may  prefer  Pep-O-mint 
.  .  .  Wint-O-green  .  .  .  Cl-O-ve  .  .  .  Lic-O- 
rice  .  .  Cinn-O-mon  .  .  .  Yi-O-let  ...  Or

weight-reducing  and  I'll  make  you  a

Close-Ups  and  Long-Shots 


ANNOUNCEMENT  of  the  retirement  of  Jesse 
Lasky  as  vice-president  in  charge  of  all  pro- 
eduction  of  Paramount-Publix  Corporation  is 
much  more  than  a  mere  news  statement.  It  is  sym- 
bolic of  the  changes,  relatively  swift  (as  well  as  great) 
within  the  motion  picture  industry  in  less  than  a  score 
of  years. 

In  1913,  we  find  two  picture  companies  formed  by 
men  with  similar  ideas  and  methods.  One  was  the 
Jesse  Lasky  Feature  Play  Company;  the  other  Famous 
Players,  of  which  Adolph  Zukor  was  the  guiding 
genius.  . 

Famous  Players  seemed  the  more  inspired  name.  It 
had  the  right  ring  to  it.  It  promised  much.  To  make 
good  the  title,  the  most  celebrated  actress  of  her  day 
was  obtained — Mme.  Sarah  Bernhardt — to  star  in 
"Queen  Elizabeth."  This  production,  filmed  in  Paris, 
was  a  big  success  and  started  Zukor  well  on  his  way. 

Meantime,  in  association  with  others,  Lasky  pro- 
duced "The  Squaw  Man."  Dustin  Farnum  had  the 
title  role  in  this. 

Zukor  saw  the  picture  and  liked  it,  and  sent  Lasky 
a  telegram  of  congratulation.  That  brought  the  two 
men  together  in  a  merger — the  Paramount  Famous 
Players-Lasky  Corporation. 

In  Zukor  and  Lasky  was  united  a  happy  combina- 
tion of  business  capacity,  imagination  and  practical 
idealism.  They  made  their  company  a  power  in 
motion  pictures. 


THE  extraordinary  expansion  of  the  industry  swept 
them  along  into  more  intricate  organization  and 
greatly  increased  capitalization.  There  emerged 
eventually  the  Paramount-Publix  Corporation,  with  a 
great  chain  of  theaters  as  part  of  the  scheme  of  opera- 
tion. 

Today,  John  Hertz,  chairman  of  the  board  of 
finance,  and  vice-president  Sam  Katz,  respectively  owe 
their  dominating  positions  in  the  corporation  to  a 
genius  for  organization  and  a  remarkable  aptitude  for 
showmanship. 

It  may  be  said  of  motion  pictures  in  general  that 
they  began  with  men  of  ambition  and  ideas  who  made 
these  qualities  stand  largely  in  lieu  of  capital.  It  was 
almost  inevitable,  however,  that  big  financial  interests 
should  take  over  the  direction  or  control  of  a  consider- 
able part  of  the  industry. 


The  founders  had  their  comparatively  brief  but 
glorious  day  before  corporate  methods  proved  superior 
to  individual  ones. 


IT  is  rather  significant  that  the  two  men  who  have 
held  a  foremost  position  on  the  screen  through  the 
years  are  comedians  who  have  made  of  the  public's 
love  of  laughter  a  thoroughly  organized  business. 

Charles  Chaplin  and  Harold  Lloyd  scarcely  meet 
their  clients'  demand  for  their  products.  They  prefer 
to  turn  out  comedies  with  a  Rolls-Royce  finish  rather 
than  to  follow  mass  production.  Periods  of  a  year  or 
more  intervene  between  their  screen  successes. 


I  HAVE  often  wondered  about  these  two  men,  com- 
parable to  one  another  in  their  working  methods, 
yet  so  dissimilar  in  their  private  lives. 

Charlie,  constantly  getting  into  the  news  prints — 
divorce,  trying  to  keep  his  children  out  of  pictures, 
rumors  about  a  new  marriage.  All  of  which  is  really 
his  own  business,  and  which  he  himself  makes  no 
attempt  to  publicize. 

Harold — about  whom,  personally,  less  is  written, 
probably,  than  any  other  star — living  much  the  life  of 
an  average  citizen,  golfing,  quietly  entertaining 
friends,  playing  with  his  children. 

Charlie's  life,  crowded  with  those  events — pleasant 
or  otherwise — that  tradition  apportions  to  a  celebrity, 
particularly  one  engaged  in  some  form  of  the  fine  arts. 

Harold,  almost  equally  famous,  pursuing  the  same 
vocation  as  Charlie,  his  days  and  nights  untroubled  by 
domestic  upsets. 

What  is  it  that  differentiates  the  private  lives  of 
these  two  men?  I  am  afraid  the  answer  won't  be 
found  in  the  cards  or  in  astrology.  Let's  say  it's  just 
fate. 

IS  George  M.  Cohan  a  regular  fellow,  or  "just  an- 
other actor"  from  Broadway?  Don't  ask  Holly- 
wood, which,  in  spite  of  its  reputation  for  garrulity, 
can  refrain  from  critical  comment  of  the  departed 
guest;  and  don't  ask  George,  either;  for  he  has  already 
spoken  his  little  piece. 

Here's  what  happened:  When  George  was  invited 
by  Paramount  to  come  out  to  Hollywood  and  make  a 
picture,  everyone  was  happy  over  it,  and  the  studio 

25 


welcomed  him  as  one  whose  reputation  as  an  actor 
entitled  him  to  the  greatest  respect. 

Bui  the  man  who  made  the  Stars  and  Stripes 
famous  twenty-five  years  ago  by  running  up  and  down 
the  stage  yelling  "It's  a  grand  old  flag,"  accepted 
Hollywood's  hospitality  complacently,  if  not  gra- 
ciously, and  then  proceeded  to  show  everybody  how 
they  ought  to  run  the  business. 

On  the  third  day  on  the  set  he  had  a  unique  idea — 
this  idea  usually  conies  about  that  time— he  began  to 
show  the  director  how  to  direct. 


SAID  George  in  effect :  "This  is  the  way  we  do  it  on 
the  stage;  that's  the  way  we  do  it  in  New  York," 
and  it  took  all  the  California  hospitality  the  director 
possessed  to  refrain  from  retorting:  "And  these  are  the 
ways  we're  not  going  to  do  it  in  this  picture!" 

Anyhow,  George  finally  went  on  his  way,  proclaim- 
ing to  the  press  that  picture  dialogue  was  silly  and 
that  he  would  be  ashamed  of  his  children  if  they 
should  write  anything  so  poor. 

Well,  some  people  "go  Hollywood,"  and  some  "go 
Broadway";  only,  the  latter  malady  seems  to  be  in- 
curable. 


A  GREAT  man,  tormented  by  doubts  that  some- 
times possess  the  souls  of  deep  thinkers,  leaving 
them  melancholy — such  was  Paul  Bern.  What  it  is 
that  often  tortures  the  consciousness  of  entirely 
upright  and  lovable  people,  science  has  never  told  us 
ami  religion  does  not  always  reveal.  Sensitive  souls, 
that  often  suffer  when  others  can  see  no  cause:  it  is 
an  enigma. 

But  of  one  thing  there  can  be  no  doubt:  Paul  Bern 
was  one  of  the  best  loved  men  in  Hollywood.  And 
immediately  after  his  death  friends  told  and  re-told 
how  he  had  helped  those  who  needed  help. 

He  could  scent  trouble,  and  whenever  anyone  was 
hurt  by  grief  or  disappointment  Paul  was  always  on 
hand.  Barbara  La  Marr,  Mabel  Xormand,  Jetta 
Goudal  are  but  a  few  who  knew  the  kindliness  of  his 
guiding  hand. 


the  chase,  rumor  died  down,  and  her  name  no  longer 
found  a  place  in  the  headlines.  Xo  one  seemed  to 
know  what  she  was  doing  with  her  vacation  in  the 
homeland. 

PHOTOPLAY,  however,  did  not  abandon  the  pursuit 
so  readily.  The  obvious  thing  to  do  was  to  put  a 
Swedish  newspaper  man  on  the  job.  And  Photoplay 
is  now  able  to  congratulate  its  readers  on  the  result. 
Incidentally,  the  attitude  of  both  the  Swedish  press 
and  the  Swedish  people  toward  their  celebrated  com- 
patriot will  seem  almost  incomprehensible  to  Amer- 
icans.   You  will  find  the  story  on  page  30  of  this  issue. 


RICHARD  DIX  is  one  of  the  few  actors  who  have 
brought  working  crews  right  up  the  ladder  of 
success  with  them.  The  prop  boy  is  now  an  assistant 
cameraman;  a  script  writer  is  now  a  director  and  a 
script  girl  is  now  a  writer. 

Sentiment?    Well,  not  altogether.    Smart  business, 
too. 


NO  one  person's  judgment  can  be  right  for  every 
picture.  Individual  tastes  differ  and  extraneous 
factors  sometimes  warp  opinions.  That  goes  for 
professional  critics  as  wrell.  Being  human,  they  are 
liable  to  error.  How,  then,  can  the  public  be  assured 
that  a  review  of  a  picture  is  a  safe  guide?  Ordinarily, 
they  can't  be. 

This  is  no  criticism  of  critics,  but  a  plain  statement 
of  fact.  There  is  a  method,  however,  to  circumvent 
this  situation.  And  Photoplay  follows  it.  In  most 
instances,  two  reviewers  are  assigned  to  see  and  report 
on  an  important  picture.  They  sit  separately,  write 
their  opinions  separately  and  then  their  opinions  are 
brought  together  and  compared.  In  case  of  doubt, 
a  third  critic  may  be  assigned  to  the  job. 

Photoplay's  readers  thus  get  the  benefit  of  all  this 
careful  consideration  wdien  they  follow  the  "Shadow 
Stage"  reviews.  I  feel  that  there  is  no  feature  in  the 
publication  more  important  than  this  department  and 
that,  therefore,  none  merits  more  care  in  its  prepara- 
tion. 


ITHIXK  one  of  the  most  amazing  things  about  Paul 
was  the  fact  that  he  had  the  ability  to  make  any 
person  who  came  to  him  for  aid  believe  in  himself 
again.  The  money  he  gave  away  was  incidental  com- 
pared to  this  talent  for  restoring  lost  courage. 

So  aide  to  help  others;  so  helpless  to  aid  himself! 

Going  on  is  what  Paul  Bern  would  have  wanted 
Jean  Harlow  to  do,  since  he  was  so  proud  of  her  and 
her  career.  So  Jean  is  going  on.  And  that's  the  best 
tribute  she  could  pay  to  Paul's  memory.

CLARA  BOW  has  attained,  within  the  space  of  a 
few  brief  years,  the  amazing  distinction  of  being 
almost  a  tradition. 

You  may  or  may  not  like  her  acting,  you  may  not 
believe  yourself  particularly  interested  in  what  she  says 
or  what  she  does,  but,  nevertheless,  you  can  not 
wholly  escape  her  dynamic  personality. 

The  fact  that  the  public  has  awaited  with  such  lively 
curiosity  her  return  to  the  screen  in  the  face  of  the 
fierce  competition  of  established  and  rising  celebrities 
is  in  itself  remarkable. 

Hers  is  not  a  synthetic  popularity.  It  is  not  one 
artificially  stimulated  by  press-agent  methods.  The 
secret  lies  within  the  girl  herself.

The  Return  of  Clara  Bow 


By  Henry  Crosby 


IT  is  one  of  the  most  dra- 
matic  moments  of  the 
month. 
The  cameras  and  micro- 
phones stand  ready  to  record 
an  event  for  which  movie  audi- 
ences have  been  waiting. 

Clara  Bow,  who  has  not  set 
foot  inside  a  studio — for  work- 
ing purposes — for  almost  two 
years,  is  ready  to  begin  the  first 
scene  of  "Call  Her  Savage." 

There  had  been  innumerable 
delays  which  Hollywood 
prophesied  would  put  a  jinx  on 
the  picture. 

First  they  had  waited  for 
Clara  to  lose  the  extra  weight 
she  had  taken  on  since  her  ill- 
ness. 

Then  there  were  story  diffi- 
culties, and  at  last  when  every- 
thing seemed  set  and  Clara  and 
her  husband,  Rex  Bell,  were  on 
their  way  to  the  studio  for  final 
tests  there  was  an  automobile 
accident  which  left  a  cut  on 
Clara's  head  and  sent  her  to 
the  hospital  for  several  days. 

But  now,  at  last,  all  is  ready.  The  director  shoots  a  couple 
of  scenes  in  which  Clara  does  not  appear,  to  help  her  gain  her 
composure. 

Clara  does  not  watch  these  scenes.  Instead  she  goes  to  one 
side  of  the  set — an  outdoor  mountain  location  near  Los  Angeles 
— and,  to  hide  her  nervousness,  begins  to  crack  a  long  black 
whip. 

"  Rex  taught  me  how  to  do  this  at  the  ranch,"  she  remarks  to 
an  electrician. 

Suddenly  the  director  calls,  "  Clara — Gilbert — we're  ready 
for  you  now." 

Clara  Bow  and  Gilbert  Roland  come  forward.  It  is  a 
dramatic  moment  in  more  ways  than  one.  Gilbert  was  Clara's 
first  Hollywood  sweetheart.  Much  has  been  crowded  into  her 
life  since  then. 

She  has  known  all  the  joys  of  public  acclaim — then  the  sick- 
ening fears  of  a  waning  popularity — nervous  breakdown, 
screen  retirement,  her  marriage  to  Rex  Bell,  her  return  to 
health  and  her  acquirement  of  a  peace  of  mind  she  had  never 
before  known. 

IT  is  easy  to  understand  why  the  Clara  that  steps  before  the 
camera  is  a  new  personality. 

For  Clara  has  changed. 

And  most  of  all  in  her  manner.  When  she  made  her  last 
picture,  "Kick-In,"  she  was  terrified  by  the  microphone.  She 
could  not  remember  long  speeches,  so  she  made  up  her  own 
dialogue  as  she  went  along — much  to  the  confusion  of  the  other 
actors. 

Now  she  is  no  longer  afraid — a  trifle  nervous,  perhaps,  but 
most  emotional  actresses  are  when  beginning  work  on  a  new 
picture. 

And  this  is  a  significant  moment  in  Clara's  life.  A  new  era 
is  opening  in  her  career.  How  she  comports  herself  in  this 
and  following  scenes  may  determine  her  screen  future. 

Yet  her  step  is  sure.  This  last  year  when  she  left  Hollywood, 
and  left  all  her  fair-weather  friends,  to  spend  her  time  on  a 


The  girl  the  great  army  of  picture  followers  could 
not  forget — as  vivid  a  personality  in  temporary 
retirement  as  on  the  screen  —  here  she  is, 
the  new  Clara  Bow  in  "Call  Her  Savage" 


lonely  ranch  with  her  husband, 
has  given  her  assurance. 

The  director  indicates  to 
Clara  and  Gilbert  where  to 
stand.  The  cameras  are  lined 
up  on  their  faces,  the  micro- 
phones are  swung  over  their 
heads. 

Silence.  No  laughing,  no 
joking,  as  Clara  used  to  do  be- 
fore a  scene  was  filmed.  In- 
stead, she  is  softly  repeating 
her  lines  to  herself. 

"Okay  for  sound,"  some- 
body calls. 

"Quiet,  please,"  another 
person  shouts. 

"Okay,"  says  the  director. 
"Call  Her  Savage,"  has 
begun  and  the  first  Clara  Bow 
scene  is  good. 

"Okay,"  calls  the  director. 
"That  was  great,  Clara." 

There  are  other  changes,  too, 
in  Clara  Bow.  Her  appear- 
ance. Her  hair  dress — smartly 
cut  with  bangs — is  right  for 
her.  She  wears  a  pair  of  riding 
breeches  and  an  organdie 
blouse.  She  is  thinner  but  her  figure  is  still  well  rounded. 
And  she  is  more  beautiful  than  ever. 

The  title  of  her  new  picture,  "  Call  Her  Savage,"  might  lead 
you  to  believe  that  Clara  is  to  have  the  same  sort  of  role 
which  made  her  thousands  of  dollars  and  brought  her  thousands 
of  screen  admirers. 

But  this  is  not  exactly  the  case.  Her  producers  are  wise 
enough  to  know  that  the  public  wants  to  see  the  new  Clara  Bow 
— the  Clara  Bow  as  she  is  today.  She  plays  a  half-breed 
Indian  girl,  but  the  story  takes  her  into  the  sophisticated 
atmosphere  of  smart  drawing  rooms. 

Indeed,  you  will  see  two  Claras  in  this  picture—  the  old  as 
well  as  the  new.  It  looks  as  though  it  were  built  for  her  unique 
personality. 

REX  BELL  is  so  proud  of  her.  He  beams  whenever  you  tell 
him  that  Clara  is  different,  and  when  the  studio  workers 
comment  on  the  fact  that  her  tests  were  splendid  and  that  she 
is  going  to  make  a  big  comeback,  his  smile  is  as  big  as  Joe 
E.  Brown's. 

At  the  studio  they  have  surrounded  Clara  with  everything 
that  spells  good  taste. 

Her  dressing-room — which  consists  of  living  room,  make-up 
room,  kitchen  and  bath — is  done  in  early  American  and  is 
quite  as  charming  as  Ruth  Chatterton's,  which  has  a  reputation 
for  its  correct  furnishings. 

And,  by  the  way,  in  "Call  Her  Savage"  she  has  twenty-nine 
different  costumes,  each  more  lovely,  more  modish  than  the 
last.  Clara  will  make  this  one  picture  and  then  return  to 
Rancho  Clarito,  the  home  she  shares  with  Rex  in  the  desert. 
For  her  the  stimulating  life  of  Hollywood  is  no  more.  She 
knows  that  but  little  really  lies  behind  that  glamorous  surface. 
She  takes  great  pride  in  her  role  in  this  latest  picture — is 
giving  it  the  best  she's  got.  But  today  Clara  is  a  wife  first, 
an  actress  second. 

The  girl  has  changed,  and  if  you  don't  believe  it  ask  the  folks 
who  knew  her  when.

T_TOLLY\YOOD'S  most  dramatic  moment 
■*■  -^-occurred  when  Jean  Harlow  returned  to 
the  studio  to  continue  work  in  "Red  Dust." 
Though  stricken  with  grief  over  the  tragic- 
death  of  her  husband,  Paul  Hern,  it  was  her 
wish  to  resume  work. 

This  scene  is  tense  with  picture  drama — one 

88 


to  which  Jean  had  to  give  all  of  her  abundant 
ability.  There  was  but  one  rehearsal.  Then 
the  director  called  for  "lights"  and  "sound" 
and  the  cameras  ground. 

A  gay,  bold  girl  on  the  set,  she  crept  away 
to  sit  alone  in  a  corner  of  the  stage,  a  pathetic 
little  widow,  the  minute  that  her  work  was 


done.  "Red  Dust"  was  but  one  of  the  many 
vehicles  that  Paul  Bern  —  who  was  her  studio 
supervisor  as  well  as  her  husband — had  planned 
for  her  to  further  the  career  in  which  he 
took  so  much  pride.  Clark  Gable  is  the  star 
of  the  picture,  and  Mary  Astor,  Tully  Marshall 
and  Donald  Crisp  have  leading  roles. 


Why 

Chevalier 

Sits  Alo 


'S: 


By  Jack 
Grant 


INCE    the   war,    I 

have  been  living  on 

Iborrowed   time. 

Some  day  the  loan 

will  be  called.  Then  pouff ! ' ' 

So  Maurice  Chevalier 
spoke  of  the  war  injury 
that  for  years  has  im- 
perilled his  life — the  sud- 
den death  he  carries  near 
his  heart,  so  dangerously 
near  that  no  doctor  dares 
to  operate.  This  is  the 
first  time  he  has  ever  been 
prevailed  upon  to  talk 
about  it  at  all. 

Reams  of  copy  have 
been  written  in  an  at- 
tempt to  solve  the  mys- 
tery of  Chevalier.  Con- 
jectures are  numerous  re- 
garding his  apparent  dual 
personality.  On  the  screen, 
a  sparkling,  gay  romantic. 
Off-screen  a  somber,  sol- 
emn man. 

There  is  no  doubt  that 
the  Chevalier  you  know  in 
pictures  is  not  the  real 
Chevalier.  His  gaiety  is 
assumed,  put  on  and  taken 
off  with  his  make-up.  His 
eyes  lose  their  sparkle,  his 
lips  their  smile  when  he  is 
not  facing  a  camera.  The 
man  undergoes  an  amaz- 
ing transformation  when 
he  stops  working.  It  is  like 
turning  off  a  light. 

ON  the  set,  he  usually 
sits  by  himself.  Fellow 
workmen  call  him  taci- 
turn, moody.  Visitors  pass 
him  by.  They  do  not  rec- 
ognize in  this  seemingly 
brooding  chap  the  dashing 
Chevalier  they  saw  in 
"The  Love  Parade,"  "The 
Smiling  Lieutenant," 
"One  Hour  With  You," 
and  "Love  Me  Tonight." 

These  facts  have  been 
established  time  and  again. 

The  mysterious  persons  that  are  both  Chevalier  have  been 
thoroughly  discussed  and  dissected.  But  no  mystery  remains 
when  you  know  what  Chevalier  knows — that  his  death  warrant 
is  signed  and  sealed  with  shrapnel. 

Attacks  upon  his  habit  of  sitting  alone,  of  avoiding  crowds, 
of  failing  to  enter  into  the  Hollywood  spirit  of  things  as  it  per- 


The  camera  has  caught  him  as  he  really  is — not  the 
Chevalier  of  the  irresistible  smile,  but  a  moody,  taci- 
turn man — a  puzzle  to  those  who  do  not  understand 


tains  to  parties  and  pals — 
charges  that  he  is  high-hat, 
mercenary,  egotistic,  humor- 
less, Chevalier  meets  with  a 
shrug.  Even  when,  by 
chance,  I  discovered  his  se- 
cret, heattempted  bydepre- 
cation  to  avoid  questioning. 
"The  war,  it  is  so  long  ago. 
There  is  nothing  to  say  I 
haven't  said  before." 

But  there  is,  M.  Cheval- 
ier. A  great  deal  to  say. 
Tell  the  world  exactly  where 
that  piece  of  shrapnel  is 
lodged  in  j'our  body.  Don't 
dismiss  the  seriousness  of 
your  injury  by  saying — as 
you  "have  said  before" — 
that  it  is  in  your  lung. 

Tell  those  who  have  for- 
gotten what  they  learned  of 
anatomy  in  school  that  the 
human  heart  is  a  hollow, 
muscular  organ  situated  in 
the  thorax  between  the  two 
lungs — that  it  is  inclosed  in 
a  strong  membranous  sac, 
called  the  pericardium  and 
that  the  shrapnel  is  pressed 
so  closely  to  this  sac  that  its 
removal  might  cause  your 
heart  to  burst  in  the  thus 
weakened  place. 

ADMIT  that  you  must 
not  indulge  instrenuous 
exercises  —  that  you  avoid 
turning  your  body  quickly 
from  the  waist  —  that  a 
friendly  slap  on  the  back 
might  end  everything  for 
you. 

Tell  them  these  things. 
You  are  doing  yourself  an 
injustice  by  keeping  silent. 
You  will  not  be  accused  of 
self-pity,  of  seeking  sym- 
pathy. But  you  will  be 
allowed  to  sit  undisturbed. 
"It  is  true,"  Chevalier 
said,  "that  this  war  memen- 
to is  more  troublesome  than 
I  like  to  acknowledge.  I  do 
not  talk  about  it  because 
talking  makes  me  think. 
Thinking  does  no  good 
when  there  is  nothing  to  be 
done.  The  doctors  tell  me 
not  to  think. 

"We  look  to  see  where 
the  shrapnel  is  every  once  in 
a  while.  Maybe  some  day 
it  will  move  away  and  then 
we  operate.  Maybe  it  will 
go  the  other  way.  Who 
knows?" 

The  doctors  fear  an  ab- 
scess, from  which  there  can  be  no  recovery.  They  prescribe  a 
great  amount  of  rest  and  quiet  and  absolute  abstinence  from 
exercise. 

"I  can  drink  only  a  little,  smoke  only  a  little.  I  must  not 
get  angry.  I  must  not  do  this  or  that.  There  are  so  many 
'must  nots' and  so  few 'can  do's'."  [  please  turn  to  page  114  ]

No  Chaplin  Honors 


The  inside  story  about  how 
the  mysterious  Garbo  spent 
her  summer  vacation 
in   her  native  Sweden 


A  villa  at  In- 
garo,  an  islet  of 
the  Stockholm 
archipelago, 
where  Greta  hid 
herself  while  she 
was   in    Sweden 


IT  was  a  typical  Swedish  yell,  a  little  self-con- 
scious and  awkward,  for  the  Swedes  are  not 
the  most  demonstrative  people  on  earth. 
'•Heja,  Greta!" 

The  crowd  numbered  several  thousand,  pack- 
ed tight  on  the  long  pier  in  the  little  seaport  of  Gothenburg.    The 
young  woman  in  a  gray  cape,  who  stood  looking  down  at  the 
pier  from  the  top  of  the  gangplank  that  stretched  to  the  deck 
of  the  ocean  liner,  smiled. 

"Heja,  Greta!" 

Sweden,  or  at  least  a  part  of  Sweden,  was  once  more  offering 
a  welcome  home  to  Greta  Gustafsson  Garbo. 

And  history  had,  in  a  sense,  repeated  itself. 

The  scene  was  comparable,  in  many  respects,  to  that  day  in 
the  spring  of  \l)J*>\  when  Charles  Chaplin,  London-born,  stepped 
from  the  train  in  the  city  where  he  dreamed,  as  a  youth,  of  fame 
and  success. 

Then  it  was: 

"Welcome  home,  Charlie!'' 

"God  bless  you,  Charlie!" 

AX  1 )  the  meaning  was  the  same.  The  public  welcoming  back 
a  person  whose  career,  by  the  grace  of  the  gods  that  be,  had 
been  colorful,  romantic.    A  person  who  had  started  from  scratch 
and  succeeded   against  odds.    Who  re- 
turned, victory-flushed  and  laureled,  to 
the  place  where  the  race  began. 

Does  the  similarity  between  Chaplin's 
and  Garbo's  home-coming  stop  here? 

What  happened  to  Chaplin  in  London 
is  well  known.    Chaplin  brought  a  smile 

SO 


When  Charlie  Chaplin  visited  his  birthplace, 
London,  he  was  at  first  entertained  by  royalty. 
Lady  Milbanke  is  seated  here  next  to  Charlie 


with  him  when  he  stepped  from  the  train.  But  when 
he  left  London  the  smile  was  gone. 

Everyone  knows  the  details.  The  invitation  to  ap- 
pear in  a  "charity"  show,  a  "command"  (from  the 
king)  performance.  Chaplin's  refusal.  The  check  for 
a  thousand  dollars  which  he  sent  along  with  that  note. 

And  Chaplin,  criticized,  slapped  back  .  .  .  and 
slapped  hard.  "Hypocrites,"  he  called  the  British,  in 
a  published  interview. 

Then  the  famous  remark  by  Chaplin:  "They  say  I 
have  a  duty  to  England.  I  wonder  just  what  that  duty 
is?  No  one  wanted  me  or  cared  for  me  in  England  sev- 
enteen years  ago.  I  had  to  go  to  America  for  my  chance. 
I  got  it  there. " 

Chaplin  denied,  moreover,  that  the  invitation  was  a 
"command"  appearance  before  King  George.  But 
London  viewed  the  matter  differently. 

So  it  was  English  royalty,  in  a  sense,  that  took  the 
smile  from  the  face  tjf  Chaplin. 


Garbo's  1929  trip 
home  was  gay.  Here 
you  see  her  drinking 
champagne  with 
her  mother  and  an 
actor  friend 


for  GARBO 


By  Axel 
Ingwerson 


While  at  his  left  is  the  Prince  of  Wales  and  the 
Duchess  of  Sutherland.  Royalty  felt  that  the 
little  comedian  snubbed  them.    What  a  row! 


Now,  what  about  Garbo?  Was  there  any  chance  that 
Swedish  royalty  would  bring  about  a  situation  such  as 
Chaplin  experienced?  Did  Garbo  have  to  worry  about 
a  "command"  appearance  in  Stockholm? 

Did  Garbo  remember,  as  Chaplin  did,  with  the  same 
sort  of  bitterness,  that  she  had  to  go  to  America  to  get 
her  chance? 

What  does  the  royal  castle  in  Stockholm,  beautiful 
even  in  its  rather  rococo  architecture,  mean  to  the  girl 
who  years  ago  stood  in  front  of  a  mirror  in  a  modest 
Stockholm  apartment  and  painted  her  lips  with  crayon 
.  .  .  because  she  wanted  to  see  what  she  would  look  like 
and  because  she  loved  to  pretend? 

It's  quite  a  story. 

To  begin  with  it  doesn't  hurt  to  remind  you  that 
Garbo  already  has  had  something  to  do  with  Swedish 
nobility.  You  will  recall  her  friendship  with  young 
Prince  Sigvard,  twenty-five-year-old  son  of  the  Crown 
Prince  of  Sweden.     A  friendship  that  started  on  board

Iw 


In  this  gray  tweed 
costume  Garbo 
walked  about  the 
streets  of  Stock- 
holm and  visited 
familiar  haunts 


the  steamer  "Gripsholm"  when  Garbo  came  home  in  1929. 

That  continued  in  Stockholm  where  Garbo  danced  at  the  Strand 

Hotel  with  the  dark-haired  young  prince,  who  is  something  of 

an  artist  when  it  comes  to  stage  decorations. 

But,  aside  from  that,  Garbo  has  yet  to  receive  any  recogni- 
tion or  attention  from  the  royal  family  of 
Sweden.  There  never  has  been  any  open 
indication  of  the  attitude  of  the  royal 
family  toward  her. 

But  the  members  of  the  Swedish  royal 
family,  who  are  exceedingly  democratic 
and  popular,  most  assuredly  must  recog- 
nize in  [  PLEASE  TURN  TO  PAGE   127  ]

Whooie^  Here 


By  Sara  Hamilton 

ILLUSTRATED    BY   VAN   ARSDALli 


HIS  mother  watched  him  from  the  porch  as  he  trudged 
up  the  street  on  sturdy  little  legs. 
"Joey,"  she  called  to  him,  "have  you  got  a  clean 
handkerchief?'' 

Joe  E.  Brown  laid  down  the  neatly  wrapped  bundle  that 
held  a  pair  of  patched  underdrawers  (handed  down  from  three 
brothers  ahead)  and  an  extra  shirt. 

"Yes,  ma,"  he  yelled  and  every  house  in  Toledo,  Ohio, 
swayed  gently  on  its  foundations  as  the  echo  of  that  call 
reverberated  through  the  town. 

"All  right,"  she  said,  "and  don't  get  your  feet  wet  or  get 
stepped  on  by  an  elephant,  for  heaven's  sake." 

And  he  was  gone.  Around  a  corner  of  Toledo  and  the  corner 
of  a  young  life. 

Walking,  not  running,  mind  you,  away  to  join  a  circus.  A 
little  nine-year-old  boy  with  twinkly  blue  eyes,  a  nose  that 
looked  for  all  the  world  like  a  stubby  little  engine  emerging 
from  the  open  tunnel  of  a  mouth  beneath. 

One  actually  waited  any  moment  for  the  whistle  to  blow 
and  the  passengers  to  alight. 

But  just  the  same,  Joe  E.  was  on  his  way. 

He  was  now  one  of  the  Five  Marvelous  Ashtons,  though 
none  of  them  were  really  marvelous  and,  for  that  matter,  none 
of  them  were  Ashtons.  But  Joe  was  that  little  ball  that  flew 
madly  from  Papa  Ashton  to  Cousin  Ashton  from  a  trapeze 
fifty  feet  in  the  air.  And  often  as  not  never  completed  the 
journey  from  papa  to  cousin  and  landed  in  a  net  below.  And 
broke  a  jaw  or  something. 

It  was  a  life.  He  had  all  the  strength,  heart,  life  and  soul 
beat  and  pommeled  out  of  him,  but  doggedly  kept  on.  Going 
back  every  winter  to  Toledo  for  school  and  never  breathing 
to  his  ma  what  he  endured  in  circuses  during  the  summer. 
He  knew  he'd  never  get  to  go  back  if  he  did. 

It  grew  pretty  bad.  Even  when  Joe  joined  a  tumbling  troupe 
and  was  hurled  to  the  stage  because  of  a  mistake  and  broke  a 
leg.    Zowie!    Just  like  that. 

Then  Joe  picked  up  the  pieces  that  remained  after  five  years 
of  circus  life  and  took  himself  off  to  join  a  vaudeville  act. 
And  was  he  terrible?  In  several  villages  (they  wouldn't  let 
him  in  the  towns)  the  citizens  actually  called  a  town  meeting 
to  know  what  could  be  done  with  the  gosh-darned  drought 
that  "wuz  a  ruinin'  the  crops  and  that  there  pesky  vaudeville 
team  that  kept  on  playin'  when  no  one  wanted  to  see  'em." 


And  then  came  one 
of  the  tragedies  of  Joe's 
young  life  (soft  music, 
please).  They  reached 
a  village  with  several 
other  acts  and  proceeded  to  put  on  a 
show  in  the  combination  fire  house, 
hoosegow  and  barber  shop.  They 
stretched  up  a  canvas  in  a  four  by  six 

space  and  the  women  dressed  on  one  side  and  the  men  dressed 
on  the  fire  truck.     Hanging  their  clothes  all  over  the  thing. 

Joe,  in  his  tights  (and  there  was  a  picture!),  stood  in  the  wings 
watching  a  heartrending  and  soul-stirring  act,  according  to 
the  bill  boards,  and  everything  was  sad  and  very  quiet.  Si 
Perkins  had  durned  near  wept  his  goatee  off  when  suddenly 
there  was  a  loud  clang  over  their  heads.  THE  FIREBELL! 
Ding  dong,  ding  dong. 

In  an  instant  every  last  ninety-four  citizens  of  that  village 
were  in  a  turmoil  and  the  fire  engine  half  way  to  Centerville 
before  Joe  could  open  that  mouth  of  his  and  yell.  It  was  on 
its  way  to  a  fire  with  Joe's  pants  hanging  on  the  side.  And 
for  three  hours  he  shivered  and  shook 
until  the  fire  engine  returned  with  a  pair 
of  wet,  bedraggled  pants.  With  the  seat 
and  one  leg  missing. 

THEN  on  to  San  Francisco.  Joe  was  a 
big  boy  of  fifteen  now  and  old  already 
in  the  ways  of  show  business.  That  night 
they  completed  their  act  that  grew 
mustier  as  the  years  wore  on  and  Joe 
went  home  and  went  to  bed.  But  sud- 
denly he  was  out  of  bed  again  with 
the  bed  flatter  than  a  pancake  and 
the  whole  city  doing  a  shimmy. 

The  great  earthquake  was  on. 
Joe  rushed  outdoors.  "Save  my 
things,"  the  landlady  screamed  as 
the  fire  broke  out  over  the  city. 
So  Joe  rushed  in,  seized  a  grand- 
father's clock,  dragged  it  for  two 
blocks  and  a  half  and  fell  exhausted 
before  the  open  door  of  a  delicates- 


Comes  Joe  E. 


sen  shop.  The  inside  looked  inviting,  so  Joe  filled  his  pockets 
with  cheese  and  crackers  and  seized  what  he  thought  was  a 
case  of  soda  water.  Piling  his  case  on  the  clock  he  made  for 
the  nearest  hill. 

Never,  he  thought,  had  he  heard  soda  make  such  a  dis- 
turbance when  opened.  It  went  pop!  And  after  the  second 
pop  he  was  waving  his  champagne  bottle,  still  thinking  it  was 
soda  water,  in  the  air,  two-stepping  and  admiring  the  fire- 
works. "Suza  good  show.  Swell  HI'  city  to  put  on  this  show 
(hiccup)  for  a  fella. " 

AND  then  he  made  it.  The  end  of  every  actor's  rainbow  of 
dreams.  Broadway.  Yes  sir,  he  was  on  it.  Good  old  Broad- 
way. He  had  come  a  long,  heartbreaking  way  and  here  he  was. 
He  was  to  substitute  that  night  for  the  leading  man  in  "Listen, 
Lester." 

At  five  o'clock  in  the  afternoon  he  was  in  the  dressing-room, 
made  up.    Six  o'clock  came,  then  seven,  and  years  later  it  was 

eight.  Joe  had  fumed  and 
fussed  until  his  make-up  had 
worn  off  and  he  had  to  put  on 
more.  Finally,  the  overture. 
<$\f  >£aS$ML  And  then  it  was  played  again. 


and  by  the  time  they  began 
playing  it  the  third  time,  Joe 
was  wild  with  nerves.  Then 
came  the  manager. 

"No  show,  Joe,"  he  said. 

Joe  could  only  stand  and 
open  and  shut  that  mouth. 
Not  a  word  came  out. 

'Equity  just  called  a 
strike,"  the  manager  ex- 
plained. So  Joe  took  off  the 
make-up  and  wandered  aim- 
lessly, and  completely 
stunned,  up  Broadway.  No 
show,  no  money,    one  wife, 


two  babies,  a  sore  back,  Lis  father  had  just  died  and  well, 
you  just  name  anvthing  sad.    It  was  Joe's. 

But  strikes  don't  keep  on  striking  and  Joe  was  back  again 
on  Broadway  in  "Jim  Jam  Jems,"  "Listen,  Lester"  and 
"Greenwich  Village  Follies."  And  then  one  day  his  name  was 
readv  to  go  up  in  lights. 

It  was  just  six  o'clock  in  the  morning  in  New  York  City.  A 
funnv,  little  guv  paced  up  and  down,  up  and  down  before  a 
theater.  Several  hours  later  a  workman  on  the  roof  looked 
down  and  said  to  another  workman,  "Say,  look  at  that  guy 
down  there.  He  walks  past  here  and  then  he  runs.  Then  he 
trots  up  and  down  like  a  kangaroo.  What's  the  matter  with 
him?" 

"Aw,  he's  nuts,"  the  other  said  and  went  on  with  his  work. 

But  he  wasn't  nuts.     It  was  [please  turn  to  page  112]

KAREN  MORLFA\  new  blonde  actress  with  the  Garbo 
voice,  walked  into  the  publicity  department  of  M-G-M 
studio  clad  in  the  velvet  and  silver  creation  she  wore  in 
"Arsene  Lupin"  and  said  to  the  publicity  woman  in  a 
calm,  matter-of-fact  tone:  "I  have  two  hours  free.  If  there  is 
any  member  of  the  press  who  would  like  to  see  me,  I  shall  be 
glad  to  see  him.  If  not,  I'm  going  to  the  gallery  to  have  some 
pictures  made  of  myself  in  this  gown.  I  think  it's  good  busi- 
ness." And  with  that  she  picked  up  the  train  of  her  gown  and 
marched  off.    Galleryward. 

Good  business.  The  publicity  woman  neither  looked  alarmed 
nor  whimpered  with  fright.  Nor  did  the  office  boy  run  home 
screaming  for  his  mother. 

Good  business.  It's  being  done  in  Hollywood  today.  On  all 
sides.  And  by  blondes.  Beautiful,  mind  you,  and  movie 
actresses  in  Hollywood.  Who  speak,  heaven  preserve  Uncle 
Elmer's  young  tomato  plants,  of  "good  business." 

"Dizzy  blondes."  "Beautiful,  but  dumb."  Remember  the 
wisecracks  of  yesterday?  Well,  look  at  the  "dizzy  blondes"  of 
Hollywood  today  and  laugh  a  loud,  hollow  laugh.  For  the 
blondes  of  today  are  not  the  blondes  of  yesterday,  my  little 
lambs.  They  no  longer  ride  about  airing  their  poodles  in  orchid 
limousines  trimmed  in  bilious  green,  waving  peacock  feather 
fans  and  smelling  to  heaven  of  pink  carnation  perfume.  Oh, 
my,  no.  The  blondes  of  Hollywood  today  are  too  busy  attend- 
ing to  "good  business"  and  getting  places.  Without  the  pink 
carnation  perfume. 

They  are  as  bright  as  a  penny,  as  shrewd  as  a  politician  and 
as  alluring  as  a  whole  Follies  chorus.  But  look  closely  and 
you'll  see  a  certain  squareness  of  jaw,  a  determined  gleam  in 
every  blue  eye,  a  firmness  in  every  step. 

The  "good  business"  blondes  of  Hollywood.  Xew.  Smart. 
And  oli,  so — so — so — 

Well,  anyway,  look  at  Constance  Bennett.  If  ever  there  was 
a  perfect  example  of  the  new  blondes  in  Hollywood,  it's  Con- 
stance Bennett. 

They  tell,  with  a  chuckle,  of  the  dapper,  cocksure,  young 
bond  salesman  who  called  on  Miss  Bennett  in  her  dressing  room 
one  day  recently. 

Thirty  minutes  after  he  entered,  he  D  ~ 

emerged.     His  collar  was  wilted  and  so         13  Y      O   U  S  Q 


was  his  countenance.  He  wore  a  slightly  bewildered  look  and 
Hank's  hat,  by  mistake.  He  didn't  seem  to  have  the  slightest 
idea  where  he  was.  Or  why.  For  Connie  had  simply  out- 
talked  him,  out-argued,  out-dividended  him  on  every  point. 
She  knows  exactly  the  value  and  reason  (if  any)  behind  every 
stock.  Why  it's  up  and  why  it's  down.  She  can  out-quote  any 
old  time  quoter  in  the  business. 

A  "good  business"  blonde. 

And  who  didn't  chuckle  at  the  fast  one  Connie  pulled  last 
summer  when  the  executives  argued  the  high  salary  she  de- 
manded would  mean  high  income  tax  and  Connie  talked 
them  into  paying  the  tax  as  well. 

BUT  here's  even  a  faster  one.  When  a  producer  lends  a  star 
to  another  studio  he,  of  course,  realizes  quite  a  profit  on  the 
exchange  by  demanding  considerably  more  than  the  star's 
salary^. 

But  when  Miss  Bennett,  with  those  big,  baby  blue  eyes  and 
saucy  blonde  curls  was  farmed  out  to  Fox  and  M-G-M  and 
First  National,  she  took  herself  off  to  the  head  office  of  her 
studio  and  said  ever  so  elegantly  (and  you  know  how  elegant 
Connie  can  be),  "I'm  so  sorry.  But  I  really  must  have  half 
that  profit.  You  see  I'm  the  one  who  is  really  doing  that  work 
and  ah,  that  is,  if  you  don't  mind  I'll  take  quite  a  nice  little 
bonus  besides."  And  she  took  it.  Which  left  the  head  office 
with  practically  nothing  but  a  horrible  headache  and  a  pair  of 
slightly  popped  eyes. 

She  knows  to  a  dime  where  every  cent  of  her  money  goes. 
So  much  for  this.    So  much  for  that. 

Plenty  of  unkind  stories  have  been  written  about  Constance 
Bennett.  Which  is  certainly  to  be  expected  of  such  a  shrewd 
and  level-headed  young  woman.  Nevertheless,  it  isn't  good 
business  to  have  too  much  animosity  floating  about.  So  Miss 
Bennett  very,  very  kindly  invited  every  member  of  the  press  to 
meet  her.  To  talk  with  her.  To  get  to  know  her.  And  even- 
single  member  of  the  press  came  away  convinced  that  Connie 
Bennett  was  just  about  the  best  scout  in  Hollywood. 

Look  at  Ann  Harding.    And  that  isn't  so  hard  to  do,  either. 

The  face  of  an  angel  has  Ann,  but  oh, 

,  f  what  a  capacity  for  thinking  lies  beneath

Karen  Morley  —  treats  all

know  her  own  mind?  Money  bags  jingled  for  months,  for  many 
long  months,  unnoticed  while  Ann  held  out  for  what  she  wanted 
in  her  contract.  And  when  Ann  was  finally  convinced  that 
even  contracts  in  Hollywood  are  not  what  they're  cracked  up 
to  be,  she  goes  right  on.  Giving  her  best,  which  is  grand,  to 
poor  pictures,  and  her  best  to  good  ones.    Playing  the  game. 

But  when  Miss  Harding  took  herself  off  to  Detroit  to  buy 
that  brand-new  airplane,  very,  very  graciously  Miss  Harding 
allowed  them  to  exhibit  her  plane  in  the  air  show.  And  for  such 
graciousness  Miss  Harding  reduced  the  price  of  her  plane  to 
half.    That's  all.    Just  half. 

And  the  name  Ann  Harding  painted  boldly  and  gaily  on  the 
door  of  that  plane. 

"How — er — strange,"  Hollywood  shrugged. 

"Oh,  really?''  Ann  asks  as  she  leans  ever  so  gently  on  the 
new  plane  for  publicity  pictures  which  always  turn  out  with 
Ann  Harding  painted  grandly  on  that  door. 

AND  little  Madge  Evans  with  the  breathless  little  voice  that 
stirs  up  all  sorts  of  protective  instincts.  Madge,  it  seems, 
made  a  comeback  to  pictures  too  soon.  Much  too  soon.  As  a 
child  actress  Madge  was  a  hit.  But  at  fifteen  with  Barthelmess 
in  " Classmates,"  Madge  was  a  flop.  Discouraged?  Perhaps. 
But  not  stumped.  Madge  went  back  to  the  stage  and  worked 
and  worked  and  worked. 

A  few  years  later  certain  movie  producers  took  another  squint 
at  the  lovely  little  blonde  actress. 

"  Come  on  out  to  Hollywood,"  they  said,  "and  play  the  lead 
with  Novarro  in  '  Son  of  India.'  "  How  many  actresses,  young 
and  ambitious  and  beautiful  hear 
that  same  sirenish  call  and  aren't  im- 
mediately seized  with  the  jitters.  But 
Madge  never  jittered  a  jitter.  She 
remained  calm,  cool,  level-headed. 

"Oh,  really,"  she  smiled,  "I  thank 
you,  but  you  see  I'm  more  or  less 
established  here  on  the  stage  and  I 
wouldn't  think  of  leaving  for  just  one 
picture."  She  even  repeated  it  a  bit 
louder  for  all  to  comprehend.  "Not 
for  just  one  picture." 


They  may  be  called 
dizzy  blondes,  but  it's 
the  producers  who  are 
dizzy  when  they  get 
through  talking  business 


The  producers  fell  back  flabbergasted.  "What?"  they  de- 
manded. "After  the  classic  flop  that  little  dame  made  in 
'  Classmates'  she  won't  come  for  one  picture.  Well,"  the}' 
shrugged,  "you  can  stay." 

"Oh,  thank  vou,"  came  back  that  breathless  little  voice. 
"Thank  you,  kindly." 

It  worked. 

MADGE  came  out  with  one  flop  to  her  credit  and  a  nice 
term  contract  in  her  pocket. 
But  Madge  had  the  shrewdness  to  go  after  the  thing  right 
when  she  got  here.  I've  seen  her  rise  from  a  sick  bed  to  take 
publicity  pictures  she  had  promised.  Hour  after  hour  she 
stands  about  the  stages  drinking  in  the  scenes.  Watching. 
Learning.     Going  home  nights  to  study.    And  rest. 

Who  is  better  known  to  every  movie  fan  than  just  Lil 
Tashman?  And  why?  Certainly  Lil  is  no  Chatterton  when  it 
comes  to  acting.  She's  no  Dietrich  for  legs  or  no  Bennett  for  looks. 
What  is  it  Lil  Tashman  has?  Good  business  sense.  The 
best  that's  going.  And  Libyan  knows  her  limits.  She's  too 
clever  not  to.  But  that  didn't  stop  Miss  Tashman  from  being 
right  at  the  top.  Ah  me,  no.  Lil  was  out  to  be  a  champion 
something  or  other,  and  she  is. 

The  most  smartly  dressed  woman  in  pictures  today,  some 
say.  With  everything  that  goes  with  it.  Time  after  time  her 
throne  has  been  threatened  but  Lil  always  comes  through  with 
one  better  and  to  top  one  creation  with  a  better  one  takes  con- 
siderable topping. 

Her  house  is  the  smartest  in  Malibu.  Her  dinners  are  the 
last  word.  She  reads  the  newest 
books.    History.    Biographies. 

Her  conversation  sparkles.  Even 
if  she  yearns  for  a  good  old  "Tent 
Avenoo"  door  step  gab,  nevertheless 
Lil  sparkles. 

And  the  result?  People  clamor  for 
her.  Fans  trample  one  another  to 
pieces  trying  to  see  Lil  on  her  per- 
sonal appearances.  They  come  and 
they  go  but  Lil  is  always  with  us.

WHEN"  Lupe  Yelez  and  Virginia  Bruce 
were  cast  in  the  same  picture,  Holly- 
wood sat  back  and  waited  for  the  fight 
to  begin. 

Remember  that  Lupe  and  Jack  Gilbert  were 
sweethearts. 

Then  he  married  Virginia. 

But  Hollywood  got  cheated  out  of  some  gos- 
sip. 

The  first  day  Lupe  walked  up  to  Virginia, 
held  out  her  hand  and  said: 

"Hello.  I'm  Lupe.  I'm  clad  to  meet  the 
girl  Jack  married.    He's  a  nice  boy — Jack." 

And  now  Virginia  thinks  Lupe  is  swell  and 
doesn't  keep  her  belief  a  secret,  either. 

C\^  the  return  of  Ruth  Chatterton  and 
**^ George  Brent  to  Hollywood  after  their  mar- 
riage in  Xew  York,  they  were  met  at  the  train 
by  friends,  well  wishers,  newspaper  reporters 
and  studio  executives.  But  they  refused  to 
make  an  appearance.  Some  of  the  folks  had 
boarded  the  train  at  a  station  a  few  hours  out 
from  Los  Ingeles 

Ruth  and  George  fled  to  their  drawing-room 
and  wouldn't  appear.    And  not  even  pleading 


notes  stuck  under  the  door  changed  their  deci- 
sion. 

At  last  they  were  smuggled  off  the  train  by 
the  porter  and  conductor,  and  Ruth's  mother 
and  friends,  waiting  at  Pasadena,  waited  and 
waited. 

And  the  press  boys  who  wanted  to  give  the 
couple  a  rousing  hand  were  pretty  well  burned 
up  about  the  whole  affair. 

CO  the  battle  between  James  Cagney  and 
^Warner  Brothers  went  merrily  on. 

Warners  said  they'd  settle  in  court  if  neces- 
sary. 

And  red-headed  Jimmy  said  'twas  okay  with 
him! 

It  looked  as  though  Hollywood  might  corner 
some  more  front  page  space  in  national  news- 
papers. 

Jimmy  said  they  failed  to  notify  him  that 
his  option  was  taken  up.  Warners  said  they 
failed  on  purpose.  If  they  did  anything  like 
that,  it  would  mean  he  had  not  been  suspended 
and  they  would  have  to  pay  him  a  lot  of  back 
salary. 

Warners  also  said  that  a  contract  for  a  year 


means  work  for  a  year  and  Jimmy  hasn't  been 
working. 

But,  as  we  go  to  press,  comes  news  of  a  truce. 
Maybe  Jimmy  will  be  back,  under  contract  and 
working.

than  Clark  Gable  who,  though  a

that  fact  affect  his  head. 

On  the  other  side  of  the  partition 
are  tables  where  the  more  important 
people  eat,  and  the  rest  of  the  time 
Clark  is  found  there.  When  he  was

paid  to  queens  from  a  lot  of  people 
in  Hollywood.  But  there  is  one  fel- 
low to  whom  she  is  just  another 
movie  actress. 

The  door  of  Miss  Bennett's  dress- 
ing-room scraped  noisily  when  clos- 
ing, so  a  studio  carpenter  whom 
Connie  had  never  seen  before  was 
sent  over  to  fix  it. 

He  scraped  and  fixed  and  at  last 
turned  with  a  beaming  face  to  the 
famous  star  and  inquired,  "Kow's 
that,  Connie?" 


YX  TELL,  sir,  Hollywood  can't  get  over  it. 
Hollywood's  most  colorful  and  vitriolic 
director  gone  good.  Eric  Von  Stroheim,  the 
man  you  love  to  hate,  is  behaving  himself  like 
an  ordinary  citizen.    It's  colossal! 

For  instance,  there's  the  picture  "Walking 
Down  Broadway,"  that  Eric  is  directing  for 
Fox.  Instead  of  being  exactly  fourteen  months 
and  two  million  dollars  behind  schedule,  Von 
is  actually  three  hours  ahead  in  his  shooting, 
and  saving  money.  Now  you  know  a  shock 
like  that  is  bad.  People  can't  bear  it.  And 
not  only  that,  he's  kind,  understanding  and 
human.     Even  the  extras  like  him. 

The  other  day  an  electrician  burned  his  hand 
and  no  less  a  person  than  the  despotic  Mr. 
Von  Stroheim  bound  it  up.  But  wait.  That's 
not  all.  He's  gone  in  for — guess  what — bicycle 
riding,  and  can  coast  down  hills,  without  hold- 
ing onto  the  handle  bars,  mind  you. 

Oh,  I  tell  you,  Hollywood  wouldn't  be  sur- 
prised at  anything  now. 

JOAN  CRAWFORD  and  Douglas  Fairbanks 
Jr.,  returned  from  Europe  in  a  whirl  of  en- 
thusiasm.    Never  did  two  folks  have  such  a 


good  time.  They  were  feted  in  London  and 
Paris  and  literally  mobbed  by  adoring  fans 
wherever  they  appeared. 

The  most  amusing  incident  concerns  the 
night  they  went  to  see  Noel  Coward's  play, 
"Cavalcade,"  in  London.  Leaving  the  thea- 
ter, they  were  rushed  by  the  mob.  The  crowd 
literally  tore  Joan's  coat  off,  and  Doug's  clothes 
were  a  bit  shredded. 

With  the  aid  of  a  dozen  stalwart  bobbies, 
they  managed  to  push  on  to  their  car,  but  so 
thick  grew  the  mob  that  the  chauffeur  could 
not  start. 

Ardent  admirers  pounded  upon  the  windows 
of  the  car  until  at  last  Joan  had  to  open 
them  so  that  the  people  could  touch  her. 

It  looked  like  one  of  Cecil  De  Mille's  mob 
scenes  and  there  was  danger  that  someone 
might  be  hurt. 

In  the  midst  of  all  this  melee,  one  of  those 
very  British  "bobbies"  turned  to  the  milling, 
surging,  howling  crowd  and  said,  in  his  cockney 
accent:  "I  say,  now.  Aren't  you  a  bit  rude?'5 
My  word! 

Joan  says  that  for  understatement,  that  wins 
all  the  prizes.

Introducing  a  new  Hollywood  blonde. 
Cute?  Oh,  we  can't  fool  you.  It's  your 
old  friend,  Mitzi  Green,  gone  light 
headed  for   "Little   Orphan  Annie" 


Here's  the  lad  who  played  the  fiddle  while  Rome  indulged  in  a  little 
hot  stuff.  It's  the  first  picture  of  that  great  English  actor,  Charles 
Laughton,  who  made  your  flesh  creep  in  "Devil  and  the  Deep,"  all 
dolled  up  for  the  role  of  Nero  in  C.  B.  De  Mille's  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross" 


A  I- THOUGH  they  work  at  adjoining  studios 
■*  in  Hollywood,  Joan  Crawford  met  Laurel 
and  Hardy  for  the  first  time  in  London.  The 
occasion  of  their  meeting  was  a  reception  given 
in  their  honor.  Their  English  hosts,  believing 
all  movie  actors  to  be  close  friends,  made  no 
attempt  at  introductions.  It  wasn't  until  later 
in  the  evening  that  Joan  encountered  the  other 
guests  of  honor  and  introduced  herself. 

Joan,  by  the  way,  returned  from  her  Euro- 
pean vacation,  her  first  at  that,  without  pur- 
chasing many  items  of  clothing  in  Paris.  The 
custom  inspectors  couldn't  imagine  such 
strange  procedure.  It  was  only  after  an  ex- 
haustive search  that  they  passed  her  luggage. 
Douglas  Fairbanks,  Jr.,  however,  went  on  a 
buying  spree.  The  Bond  Street  wardrobe  he 
selected  in  London  more  than  made  up  for 
Joan's  lack  of  interest  in  Parisian  gowns. 

QLARK     GABLE    is    learning    to

TN  Richard  Dix's  contract  it  is  written  that 
no  stills  or  photographs  taken  may  be  released 
without  his  approving  them.  And  he  exercised 
that  right  ofttimes  to  the  despair  of  the  pub- 
licity department.  Imagine,  therefore,  the  sur- 
prise that  met  Richard  Dix's  refusal  even  to 
look  at  proofs  taken  for  "The  Conquerors" 
opposite  Ann  Harding. 

"Show  them  to  Miss  Harding,"  he  said. 
"All  that  meet  her  approval,  I  will  pass  un- 
conditionally.'' 

Gallant  chap,  Dick! 

V\  THEN  Barbara  Bebe  Lyon — you  know 
whose  baby  she  is — had  a  birthday  party 
recently,  all  the  famous  children  of  Hollywood 
attended  and  all  had  their  pictures  taken.  All 
except  one  youngster. 

Whenever  the  cameraman  was  ready  to 
.shoot,  little  Irving  Thalberg,  Jr.,  had  to  step 
out  of  the  picture. 

Mama  Norma  Shearer  and  Papa  Irving  will 
not  allow  a  single  photograph  of  their  boy  to 
he  published  in  any  paper  or  magazine. 


A  FTER  it  was  announced  that  Director 
Charles  Brabin  was  not  to  continue  direct- 
ing "Rasputin, "  Hollywood  nodded  wisely  and 
murmured,  "  Hummm,  so  he  couldn't  cope  with 
the  Barrymore  temperament." 

But  it  wasn't  Lionel,  Ethel  and  John  that 
jerked  Brabin  off  the  picture.  It  was  what  is 
known  in  Hollywood  as  "supervisor  trouble." 
The  supervisor  was  on  the  set  every  day,  mak- 
ing suggestions,  having  scenes  re-taken,  until 
at  last  the  exasperated  Brabin  cried,  "Who's 
directing  this  picture,  anyhow?"     And  those 


five  little  words  from  long-suffering  Brabin  did 
the  trick.  That's  why  Director  Richard  Boles- 
lavsky  is  telling  the  royal  family  how  to  make 
faces  for  the  cameras. 

r^OXTRARY  to  Holly-wood  expectations,  all 
^"'has  been  remarkably  quiet  on  the  Barry- 
more  front  this  month,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that 
there  has  been  a  change  in  directors  and  that 
new  dialogue  has  been  written  as  the  picture 
progressed. 

The  reason  for  all  this  goodness  and  light  is

-^  ^  When  he  played  the  title  role  in  "Tol'able  David"  he 
was  proclaimed  a  real  screen  find,  yet  a  year  passed  before 
he  was  given  another  big  chance.  During  that  time  he  was 
ready  to  leave  pictures  for  good.  But  now,  with  "The  Age 
of  Consent"  and  others  to  his  credit,  producers  realize  that 
they  won't  discover  a  better  young  actor  if  they  look  over

"T'S  strange  about  Ricardo  Cortez.    It 
really  is. 

By  all  the  laws  of  nature,  he  should 

'long  ago  have  been  a  Clark  Gable  or  Valentino  or  Gary 
Cooper.  He  has  the  build,  the  brawn,  the  appearance.  He  is 
truly  handsome.  Women  who  meet  him  in  person  go  into  the 
same  sort  of  raves  that  Clark  Gable  inspires  from  the  screen. 

In  other  words,  he  has  Sex  Appeal  with  capital  letters. 

Furthermore,  he's  a  fine  actor.  "Symphony  of  Six  Million" 
and  "Is  My  Face  Red?"  prove  that.  And  he's  able  to  play  the 
butcher,  the  baker  or  the  candlestick  maker.  Fifteen  years 
of  every  type  of  role  have  proved  that. 

And  yet,  he  has  always  just  missed  being  a  screen  sensation. 

There's  something  strange  here.     Something  wrong. 

And  Cortez  knows  it.  He  even  knows  how  to  correct  it. 
But  he  has  been  unable  to  bring  himself  to  the  point  where  he 
can  do  it. 

Now,  however,  he  has  signed  a  contract  with  Paramount. 
This  should  mean  a  new  start.  With  an  even  break  he  should 
come  into  his  own. 

When  he  read  the  criticism  of  his  work  in  "Thirteen  Women," 
in  a  Hollywood  trade  paper,  he  shuddered.  It  said:  "Just 
why  is  Cortez  wasted  in  this?     What  he  does,  he  does  well." 

He  didn't  want  to  play  in  that  picture.  He  knew  it  wasn't 
the  part  for  him.  He  had  just  acquitted  himself  nobly  in  both 
"Symphony"  and  "Is  My  Face  Red?"  Why  should  he 
descend  into  this  minor  part,  wedged  among  thirteen  women? 

He'd  been  promised  "Hell's  Highway"  originally.  Richard 
Dix  played  it. 

He'd  been  scheduled  for 
"Phantom  Fame."  Lee  Tracy 
is  doing  it. 

The  leftover  was  "Thirteen 
Women."

cardo's  trouble,  I'll  wager  forty  would 
answer,  "He's  too  high-hat.  He  doesn't 
play  the  game." 

Cortez  is  not  high-hat.  Those — like  George  O'Brien — who 
are  his  pals  would  punch  anybody  in  the  nose  who  said  he  is. 
They  swear  by  this  handsome  lad.  He's  a  pal  and  a  man  who 
understands  the  true  meaning  of  that  word  "pal." 

But  so  few  know  him. 

I  introduced  Ricardo  to  some  visitors  from  Chicago.  Six 
others  introduced  him  to  the  same  visitors.  Still,  he  did  not 
speak  when  he  met  them.  They  did  not  speak  first.  Ricardo 
was  waiting  for  them  to  recognize  him.  He  was  just  as  hurt 
as  they  were  about  it. 

Which  does  not  sound  like  an  I-must-be-noticed  motion 
picture  actor. 

AH,  there  lies  the  trouble.  He  doesn't  act  like  a  man  of  his 
profession.  He's  easily  hurt.  Terrifically  self-conscious. 
To  hide  this  sensitive  nature,  he  dons  a  hard-boiled,  sophisti- 
cated armor.     "High-hat"  is  the  resulting  general  opinion. 

Director  Gregory  La  Cava  is  one  of  Ricardo's  intimates.    He 
directed  him  in  "Symphony  of  Six  Million  "     T   - 
about  this. 

"Riccy  is  a  very  sensitive  pers" 
Hollywood,   when  anyone  has  r 
defense.     He  can't  be  fully  him

"The  so-called  inferiority  cc 


Cortez  has  them  guessing  why 
he's  not  running  with  the  leaders 
of  the  pack.    Here's  the  reason 


The  Strangest  friendship 

in  Hollywood 


IF  you  could  see  them  together  you  would 
certainly   think  it    unusual.     Dignified,  calm, 

studious,  cultured  Walter  Huston  and  volatile, 
dynamic,  excitable  Lupe  Yelez. 

Vet  between  these  two  there  has  sprung  up  a 
friendship  so  rich  and  so  beautiful  that  Holly- 
wood rubs  its  eyes  to  make  sure  it  has  seen  the 
truth. 

For  the  truth  is — and  nobody  who  has  seen 
them  together  could  doubt  it — that  this  is  no 
flirtation. 

Walter  Huston,  being  what  he  is,  could  never 
be  interested  in  any  woman  that  way. 

And  Lupe?  Well,  she  worships  Walter  as  if 
he  were  some  very  dear  and  loyal  uncle. 

This  is  friendship — just  plain,  real  friendship. 
And  what  it  is  doing  for  both  Lupe  and  Walter, 
principally  Lupe,  is  a  very  sweet  page  in  Holly- 
wood history. 

There  are  lots  of  girls  in  Hollywood  who  have 
had  real  friendships  with  men,  when  there  was 
no  thought  of  love  between  them.  Remember 
Lon  Chaney  and  Norma  Shearer — when  Lon 
helped  Norma  with  her  make-up  and  gave  her 
advice  about  acting  that  she  will  never  forget. 
Remember  Joan  Crawford  and  Bi'ly  Haines,  who 
have  laughed  together  and  argued  together — 
and  still  do.  Billy  will  fight  a  battle  for  Joan  at 
the  drop  of  a  supervisor's  hat.  Remember  Elsie 
Janis  and  Ramon  Novarro.  Elsie  gave  Ramon 
advice,  criticized  and  praised  him.  They  were 
great  pals.  And  I  could  point  to  a  dozen  other 
such  friendships. 

But  Lupe  Yelez — she  expects  and  receives  ad- 
miration. You  couldn't  imagine  Lupe  being  even 
slightly  interested  in  a  man  who  was  impervious 
to  those  "beeg,"  black  eyes  and  who  wouldn't 
jump  through  a  couple  of  hoops  and  do  nip- 
ups  at  her  command.  Consider  the  lads  who 
have  adored  her. 


Lupe  Velez  stood  in  awe  of  Walter  Huston's  acting  ability. 
When  they  were  placed  together  in  the  cast  of  "Kongo," 
Lupe  was  so  nervous  she  played  her  first  scene  very  badly 

And  then  suddenly  this  Walter  Huston  thing  happened.  I  say 
"suddenly."    I'm  wrong.     Here's  how  it  all  happened. 

Perhaps  the  first  time  Walter  Huston  crossed  Lupe's  consciousness 
was  a  number  of  years  ago  when  Gary  Cooper  was  making  "The 
Yirginian."  When  Gary  heard  that  Walter  was  to  have  a  role 
in  the  picture  he  came  at  once  to  Lupe  and  said,  "I'm  frightened. 
Huston  is  such  a  great  actor.  He  knows  how  to  talk — to  deliver 
lines.     What  can  I  do  against  competition  like  that?" 

Lupe  was  furious.  "Afraid?  For  shame.  You  are  Gary  Cooper. 
Aren't  you?  That's  enough.  You  don't  have  to  be  afraid  of  any- 
body.   Be  yourself  and  don't  talk  nonsense.  " 

But  Gary  was  still  frightened  at  the  ability  of  the  great  actor,  and 

when  Lupe  came  on  the  set  of  "The  Yirginian"  for  the  first  time,  she 

felt  something  of  the  awe  that  Gary  felt.    Huston 

was  so  reserved,  so  dignified.    For  once,  Lupe  was 

The  hero   Walter  restrained  and  because  it  was  a  new  sensation  to 

Huston cultured  ner — curbing    her    wild    exuberance — she    steered 

dignified  and  a  good  clear  of  Huston. 

Hollywood  citizen  Naturally,  their  paths  did  not  cross  again.  They 


Then  Walter  began  teaching  Lupe  little  tricks  of  acting — 
and  she  was  a  willing  pupil,  as  you  can  see  by  looking  at  this 
picture,  which  is  one  of  the  dramatic  scenes  from  "Kongo" 


move  in  entirely  different  Hollywood  circles  and,  small  as  the  town 
is,  one  clique  very  seldom  overlaps  another. 

Lupe  went  to  New  York  to  appear  in  a  Ziegfeld  show.  She 
returned,  triumphant,  to  sign  a  contract  for  six  new  pictures. 
"Kongo"  was  the  first.  Jubilant,  excited,  she  burst  on  the  set. 
There  was  Walter  Huston.  She  still  stood  in  awe  of  him  and  his 
long  years  of  acting.    So  Walter  Huston  was  to  be  in  her  picture! 

Her  knees  trembled,  her  voice  quavered  when  they  did  their  first 
scene  together.  And,  when  the  cameras  stopped  grinding,  she  went 
quietly  to  the  corner  of  the  set  and  pretended  to  be  studying  the 
script.  But  she  wasn't.  Out  of  the  corner  of  her  eye  she  watched 
Huston. 

He  did  not  come  over  to  her  immediately.   He  sat  in  another 
corner  but  he,  too,  was  watching  Lupe.     Then 
their  eyes  met.    He  laughed  and  came  over  to  her. 

"You  have  a  great  talent,  Miss  Velez,"  he  said. 
"I  admire  you  because  of  that  talent." 

Like  a  child,  praised  by  a  respected  teacher, 
Lupe's  eyes  grew  big  with  wonder.     Why,  this

Huston  liked  her!  He  thought 
she  had  talent.  He  wasn't  to  be 
feared,  then.  He  wasn't  ritzy 
just  because  he  was  a  great 
actor. 

In  her  very  nicest  manner 
Lupe  said,  "The  admiration  is 
mutual,  Mr.  Huston." 

And  from  that  day  on  they 
have  been  the  best  of  friends. 
They  talk  continuously  while  they 
are  working  together  and  as  soon 
as  the  week's  work  is  done  Lupe, 
Walter  and  his  wife,  Nan,  dash 
away  for  little  trips  into  the 
mountains.  For  neither  Walter 
nor  Lupe  is  willing  to  let  this 
strange  friendship  lag  just  be- 
cause their  work  will  take  them 
to  different  studios. 

The  second  day  of  shooting  on 
"Kongo,"  Walter  and  Lupe  sat 
together  on  the  steps  of  the 
stage  and  talked.  Rather,  Lupe 
talked.    Walter  listened.

Marie  Dressier:  "I  have  never  been  bored.  I 
have  always  wanted  to  see  the  next  sunrise. 
I  have  always  been  glad  of  the  chance  to  live" 

ONLY  the  other  day  I  was  reading  a  letter  from  Cath- 
erine de  Medici  to  her  daughter.  That  queen  of  France 
who  lived  three  hundred  years  ago  was  all  upset. 
She  didn't  know  what  the  young  people  were  coming 
to.  Her  other  daughter,  Marguerite,  was  full  of  new  ideas. 
And  the  clothes  she  wore!  And  the  new  dances  she  danced! 
(lirls,  said  the  queen  of  France,  were  coming  to  no  good  and 
were  certainly  not  behaving  as  their  mothers  considered  it 
proper  for  girls  to  behave. 

Not  much  different  from  today,  for  we  still  hear  that  vouth 
is  a  great  problem.  Modern  mothers  and  fathers  are  dismayed. 
Teachers  are  often  in  a  fog.    The  children  are  running  wild. 

_  History  is  full  of  such  plaints.  Why  won't  youth  accept  the 
dictates  of  age?  Why  won't  youngsters  listen  and  believe  the 
words  of  experience?  Why  won't  the  new  generation  conform 
to  the  habits  and  theories  of  the  old? 

Well,  of  course,  they  won't.     They  never  have. 
Why  should  they  ?     The  glory  of  youth  is  its  determination 
to  find  (nit  tilings  for  itself.  The  beauty  of  youth  is  its  intensity, 
its  lire,  its  lack  of  compromise. 

AH  tilings  are  forgivable  to  youth.  As  we  grow  older  we 
must  not  l«.se  sight  of  that.  Implanted  in  every  heart  that  is 
worth  its  beat,  is  the  flaming  desire  to  live— to  experience — 
to  do  new  and  amazing  things.  God  bless  their  souls,  there 
isn't   any  compromise  in   'em.     The  reason  we  have  failed  to 

1 fuer  all  things,   think  they,  is  because  we  lacked  something 

and  they've  got  it.  And  little  by  little,  through  that  very 
living  force  of  youth,  lots  of  dead  wood  is  Weeded  out  of  the 
race  so  that  we  don't  stifle.

children  free  to

selves"— a  frank  dis-

Marie  Dressier 

As  Told  To 
Adela  Rogers  St.  Johns 


Mothers  and  fathers  and  teachers  and  all  of  us 
together  can't  do  anything  but  watch  and  pray  and 
be  ready  when  we  are  asked.    That's  all. 

You  know,  it's  not  of  our  knowledge  that  they  will 

be  helped,  but  of  our  faith  and  our  love  and  our  truth. 

Each  of  us  in  this  life  must  stand  alone — and  nothing  that  we 

have   learned  can  we  lend  to  anybody  else  except  through 

example  and  through  their  love  for  us. 

If  you  try  to  force  growth,  or  to  retard  it,  you  will  warp 
the  budding  soul  as  sure  as  you  will  warp  a  tree  that  you 
bind. 

How  do  we  know?  Maybe  this  new  generation  has  got  hold 
of  something  we  missed.  Maybe  they're  casting  aside  shams 
and  pretenses  and  conventions  in  order  to  be  free  to  get  at  the 
realities  of  life.  Maybe  because  they  insist  upon  proof,  be- 
cause they  strive  for  pleasure,  the}'  will  dig  through  to  some 
precept  that  we've  lost  sight  of. 

WHEN  I  was  a  girl,  I  had  within  me  great  desires  and  ambi- 
tions which  seemed  impossible  of  fulfillment.  A  big,  gawky 
lump  of  a  girl  who  wanted — of  all  things — to  go  on  the  stage. 
1  expect  if  they  could  have  kept  me  from  making  a  fool  of 
myself  by  such  an  attempt,  they  would  have  done  it.  But  it 
was  necessary  for  me  to  earn  my  own  way.  I  was  free  of  that 
terrible  burden  of  having  everything  done  for  me.  I  had  to 
develop  wings  of  my  own  if  I  was  going  to  get  anywhere.  And 
let  me  tell  you  now,  that  your  own  wings  are  the  only  ones  that 
will  ever  take  you  anywhere. 

In  my  heart.  I  knew  that  I  loved  the  theater  and  that  it  was 
my  medium  of  expression.  It  would  be  silly  to  say  that  I  saw 
it  then  as  I  see  it  now — with  the  hope  and  prayer  that  it  may 
bring  joy  and  comfort  and  release  to  others.  Girls  don't  think 
that  way.  I  didn't  see  beyond  my  own  self  because  my  own 
self  was  the  whole  world  as  far  as  1  knew.  Youth  is  made  that 
way.     Can't  change  that. 

So — I  went  ahead  and  all  my  dreams  came  true.  More  than 
my  dreams.  Why?  Not  from  any  action  of  my  own,  nor  any 
effort  or  cleverness  on  my  part.    [  please  turn  to  pace  122  ] 


What's  All 

This  Chatter 

About  Novarro? 


Is  he  a  saint  who  sud- 
denly has  turned  worldly? 


RAMON  NOVARRO  was  thirty-three  years  old  last 
February  and  it's  about  time  folks  began  to  under- 
stand the  boy. 
For  some  strange  reason,  people  got  an  idea  about 
Ramon  and  they've  clung  to  it  as  tenaciously  as  an  Adrian 
costume  clings  to  Garbo. 

Ramon  has  moved,  for  the  last  eleven  years,  in  a  mist  of  mis- 
understanding. Fact  and  fiction  concerning  Ramon  and 
Ramon's  character  have  become  so  intertwined  that  I'll  wager 
not  ten  people  can  give  you  an  accurate  estimate  of  Ramon, 
the  man. 

So,  just  for  the  fun  of  it,  Jet's  start  picking  Ramon  apart  and 
separating  the  false  from  the  true  to  see  if  we  can't  find  out 
something  real  about  this  amazing  young  man  who  has  re- 
mained a  star  for  ten  years — thereby  disproving  the  five-year 
star  span  of  Hollywood. 

I'll  wager  if  you  asked  the  average  movie-goer  to  tell  you 
what  Ramon  was  like,  he'd  give  you  a  picture  of  a  saintdike, 
idealistic,  poetic  recluse,  that  would  be  as  far  from  the  real 
Ramon  as  caviar  is  from  codfish. 

I  can  tell  you  how  this  idea  grew.  Ramon  is  religious  and 
has  always  been.  In  Hollywood  a  man  who  admits  deep  re- 
ligious convictions  must,  so  the  natives  think,  be  lacking  in 
humor,  and  human  understanding.  Presto — Hollywood  argued 
— Ramon  must  be  set  aside  because  he  was  religious. 

And  so  when,  a  couple  of  years  ago,  a  few  parties  that  Ramon 
attended  were  highly  publicized,  Hollywood  began  to  buzz 
with  gossip.  "Ramon  has  changed.  He  has  become  a  'good 
time  Charlie.'  He's  not  religious  any  more.  Why,  do  you 
know  what  he  did  last  night?" 

''What  do  you  suppose  caused  this?" 

"I  think  it  was  the  death  of  his  brother." 

"No,  it's  because  he's  in  love  with  Elsie  Janis." 


Ramon  Novarro's  life  is  so  simple  and 
above  board  that  Hollywood  is  baffled 


WITH  many  variations  it  was  the  usual  Hollywood  gossip — 
because  Hollywood  expects  sudden,  dramatic  changes  and 
will  not  accept  a  complex  character.  In  the  Hollywood  mind — 
you  are  either  religious  or  you're  not.  You're  either  a  drunkard 
or  a  member  of  the  Anti-Saloon  League.  You're  either  a  hero 
or  a  villain,  a  saint  or  a  devil.  Just  as  in  many  of  the  movies 
that  come  out  of  Hollywood  these  broad  characterizations  are 
drawn,  so  must  the  people  of  Hollywood  be  definitely  one 
thing  or  the  other.       Gradations  of  character  are  not  admitted. 

So  now  let's  go  back  a  bit  and  see  what  Ramon  was  really 
like  when  he  was  supposed  to  be  a  poetic  lad  who  longed  for 
the  priesthood,  who  led  a  life  of  mystery  and  entertained  only 
his  Mexican  friends. 

Elsie  Janis  is  credited  with  drawing  Ramon  out  of  his  shell. 
But  Elsie  Janis  didn't  do  that — for  Ramon  never  had  a  shell. 

Elsie   Janis   is   credited    with    making 
Ramon  a  human  being  and  a  regular  fel-      Tty    JC  n  tho  ri 
low  on  a  party.     Ramon  was  a  human      ^"V     J^-Ul  llti  ll 


being  and  had  been  a  regular  fellow  long  before  he  knew 
Elsie  Janis. 

One  of  Ramon's  first  Hollywood  friends  was  Kathleen  Key. 
And  no  man  can  be  a  recluse  and  be  a  friend  of  Kate  Key's. 
That  friendship  started  when  they  worked  together  in  their 
first  picture,  "The  Lover's  Oath."  And  it  lasted  through 
"Ben-Hur"  and  even  after  Kate  went  to  Paris.  When  Ramon 
went  to  Paris,  he  looked  her  up  and  they  had  some  rousing 
times  together. 

ALICE  TERRY  and  Rex  Ingram  were  his  friends.  Alice  is 
another  gay,  madcap  girl,  who  certainly  would  be  no  fit  com- 
panion for  a  man  of  mystery.  And  if  ever  there  were  a  sophis- 
ticated, worldly  gent,  it's  Rex  Ingram.  During  all  this  period 
when  Ramon  was  supposed  to  be  introspective  and  yearning 
for  a  monastery,  his  best  pal  was  a  writer — a  humorous,  gay 
chap  and  a  regular  guy. 

Renee  Adoree  was  another  of  Ramon's  friends — and  you'd 
never  have  called  Renee  a  little  sit-by-the-fire.  So  when  you 
take  that  list  of  friends — and  there  were  many  more — you'll 
find  that  it  wasn't  Elsie  Janis  who  drew  Ramon  from  his 
imaginary  shell. 

Mind  you,  he  was  no  hypocrite.  He  was,  and  still  is,  re- 
ligious. And  those  gay  friends  of  earlier  days  respected  his 
convictions. 

Ramon  never  drew  himself  away  from  "the  crowd"  at  the 
studio.  He  was  invariably  a  sought  after  member  of  the  old 
M-G-M  publicity  table  in  the  commissary,  where  the  outlaws 
and  rebels  of  the  lot  assembled  for  some  pretty  fine  story- 
telling. 

His  much  famed  theater  which  Ramon  annexed  to  his  house 
in  Los  Angeles,  and  which  no  American  was  supposed  to  have 
seen,  is  not  so  mysterious  after  all.  Ramon  never  kept  this 
theater  a  secret  and  when  I  asked  him  to  let  me  see  it,  he  de- 
murred not  at  all,  had  me  over  to  tea  there  and  showed  me  all 

over  the  place. 
no    A  1 hort  As  for  Ramon's  humor — that  he  alwavs

BEHOLD  the  glory  and  the  divinity  of  kings!  An 
impressive  scene  from  "  Rasputin,"  The  Court 
of  the  Romanoffs  in  the  days  preceding  the  Russian 
Revolution. 

It's  a  Barrymore  picture  and  how  that  royal 
family  rise  to  the  responsibility  of  their  imperial 
roles.  From  left  to  right:  Czar  Nicholas  (Ralph 
Morgan),  Czarevitch  Alexis  (Tad  Alexander),  the 
Czarina  and  Prince  Paul  Youssoupojf  (Ethel  and 
John  Barrymore) ;  and,  in  the  background,  the  Monk 
Rasputin  (Lionel  Barrymore) — his  hand  raised. 

The  director  and  his  studio  crew  watch  with  tense 
alertness.  Sitting,  white-shirted,  in  the  center  is 
Director  Richard  Boleslavsky;  hisassistant,  "Hezzy" 
Tate,  in  striped  sweater,  kneels  at  the  extreme  left, 
as  the  sound  man  works  the  mike  and  its  great  boom; 
and  Cameramen  Riley  and  Cohen  stand  at  their 
machines.  In  the  right  foreground,  kneeling,  is 
Production  Manager  Clarence  Bricker  watching  the 
gold  roll  out,  for  there's  gold  in  those  actors  and  in 
those  sets — and  what  actors  and  sets  they  are! 

The  floor  mops  in  the  foreground  play  important 
roles,  too.  Before  every  "take,"  the  floor  is  care- 
fully wiped  so  as  not  to  reveal  one  footprint  to  the 
cameras'  eagle  eyes.

That  cute  kid  "Spanky"  with  his  mother,  Mrs.  McFarland. 
The  baby  earns  more  than  his  father,  a  business  executive 


THERE'S  a  high  wind  in  Hollywood  and  the  storm  rages 
around  the  heads  of  two  amazing  children  who  would 
just  as  soon  pop  a  producer  in  the  stomach  as  to  look  at 
him.  And  have  done  it,  too,  to  Winfield  Sheehan,  head 
man  at  Fox. 

Charlie  Chaplin  tried,  through  the  courts,  to  keep  his  sons  off 
the  screen,  and  his  ex-wife,  Lita  Grey  Chaplin— and  the 
children's  mother— tried  to  put  them  before  the  cameras.  In 
fart,  Lita  signed  a  contract  for  the  boys  and  herself  to  work 
together  in  live  pictures  and  to  be  paid  SIO.OOO  apiece  a 
picture  for  the  kids  and  SI  5,000  a  picture  for  herself. 

Then,  just  when  everything  looked  rosy  all  the  way  'round, 
Chaplin  stepped  in  to  speak  out  in  meeting— and  in  court— 
these  words,  "I  want  my  boys  to  grow  up  normally  and  not  be 
forced  into  a  profession  not  of  their  own  choosing,  at  such  an 
early  age.  I  don't  pretend  that  their  physical  health  may  be 
impaired.     It's  the  spiritual  aspect  I'm  thinking  of. 

"  I  provided  generously  for  my  children  so  they  could  have  a 
normal  childhood.  I  don't  want  them  to  suffer  from  undue 
publicity  and  gain  an  abnormal  viewpoint  about  life." 

Lita  then  said  that  she  couldn't  understand  Charlie's  view- 
point, since  it  was  he  who  employed  Jackie  Coogan  to  work  in 
his  picture  "The  Kid"  when  Jackie  was  younger  than  either 
of  their  boys. 

And  while  the  battle  of  the  parents  rages,  the  two  Chaplin 
kids  are  having  a  swell  time  causing  all  sorts  of  mischief  on  the 
Fox  lot  and  daily  being  pulled  out  of  fishponds  and  sound  boxes. 

All  of  which  again  brings  up  the  question,  "  What  about  these 
kids  in  pictures?  Are  they  like  other  children  or  aren't  they?  " 
Most  mothers  and  fathers,  unlike  Chaplin,  are  willing  and 
anxious  to  have  their  little  darlings  in  the  "raoom  pitcher" 
studi 

rat  the  M-G-M  studios  in  Culver 
City,  where  Jackie  Cooper  makes  those 
hankie-soaking    tear-jerkers,     they 
a  letter  the  other  day.     It   was  from   a 
woman  in  Iowa — 

.Mosr>.  Metro,  Goldwyn  &  Ma 

tients  — 

I  see  in   my  paper  where  you  are 


Should  these  boys 
be  screen  stars? 
Their  father, 
Charlie  Chaplin, 
says  "No!"  Their 
mother  says  "Yes." 
"Sure"  say  both 
Tommy  and  Charlie

That's  the  cry 
of  movie  mad 
mothers  through- 
out  the  land  as 
they  watch  the 
talented  children 
of  Hollywood  act 
upon  the  screen 


paying  Jackie  Cooper  fifteen  hundred  dollars  (SI  500) 
a  week  and  I  have  a  son  that  can  wiggle  his  ears 
named  George  and  I  think  he  would  be  as  good  a 
star  as  Jackie  Cooper.  We  owe  a  S210  payment  on 
a  note  and  I  figure  if  I  would  let  George  work  for 
you  one  day  it  would  pay  off  that  dett  and  I  could

P.  S. — We  will  come  as  soon  as  you  send  the  railroad  tickets. 

YOU'D  be  surprised  how  many  mothers  and  fathers,  seeing  the 
Jackie  Coopers  and  the  Bobby  Coogansand  the  Mitzi  Greens 
and  the  Dickie  Moores  on  the  screen,  and  learning  about  the 
salaries  they  are  getting,  jump  to  two  primary  conclusions: 

1.  That  all  they  have  to  do  is  to  take  their  own  little  Willie  or 
Gwendolyn  to  Hollywood  to  have  the  child  immediately  become 
another  child  movie  star,  and, 

2.  That  forthwith,  they  (that  is  mama  and  papa)  will  be 
rolling  in  the  wealth  that  little  Willie  or  Gwendolyn  will  make, 


"■- 


Willie  A  STAR! 


VV         By  Harry 
Lang 


"I  put  Dorothy  in  pictures  for  money,  not  fame,"  says 
Mrs.  Grey,  mother  of  the  little  girl  who  won  honors 
in  "Symphony  of  Six  Million."    Isn't  mama  pretty? 


Jackie  Cooper  earns  $1,500  a  week,  but  his  mother, 
Mabel  Cooper,  can  spend  only  $75  of  that  salary.  The 
rest  goes  into  good  securities.      It's  a  California  law 


and  the  family  will  live  high  with  seventeen  servants,  a  flock,  of 
motor  cars,  and  a  house  in  Beverly  Hills  and  Malibu  and  maybe 
Honolulu,  too.  But  that  is  just  about  as  wrong  as  a  Hono- 
lulu diving  boy  swimming  around  a  Scotch  steamer  waiting 
for  a  coin  to  dive  for! 

BECAUSE    the   facts,   to    those   two   expressed   fallacies  of 
Mama  and  Papa,  are  this: 

1.  That  out  of  some  three  hundred  child  actors,  all  more  than 
usually  talented,  who  are  registered  with  the  various  Holly- 
wood casting  offices,  barely  a  score  make  what  might  be  called 
a  ''living"  income.  The  others,  once  in  a  great  while,  manage 
to  get  a  five-dollar-a-day  extra  bit,  or  something  like  that,  and 
if  their  parents  depended  on  them  for  the  family  income,  they'd 
be  in  the  poorhouse  by  now. 

2.  And  even  those  few  who  do  get  a  ''big"  salary,  in  the  great 
majority  of  cases,  live  nothing  but  a  fairly  normal  kid's  life — 
and  mama  and  papa  get 
virtually  nothing  at  all 
of  the  youngster's  movie 
salary,  because  the  law 
steps  in  and  says  mama 
and  papa  can't  spend  a 
cent  of  it  without  the 
court's  express  permis- 
sion. 

In  the  case  of  Jackie 
Cooper  — ■  and  we  select 
him  because  he  is,  after 
all,  the  outstanding  ex- 
ample of  a  child  earning 
a  huge  income,  only 
seventy-five  dollars  a 
week  of  his  fifteen-hun- 
dred-a-week  salary  goes 
to  his  mother.  That's 
the  salary  the  court 
allows  her  for  her  work 
as  Jackie's  manager, 
trainer,  guardian,  finan- 
cial agent,  and  every- 
thing else  she  is  to  him. 
A  few  score  dollars  more 
are  allocated,  by  the 

Jackie  Coogan,  who  has  now  out- 
grown kid  parts,  with  his  mother  and 
little   brother   Bobby,   a    rising    star 


court,  for  the  things  Jackie  needs — clothing,  professional  needs, 
and  so  on.  And  all  the  rest  of  that  fifteen-hundred-a-week  goes 
socko  into  gamble-less  investments,  under  the  unclosing  eye  of 
the  superior  court  of  the  state  of  California.  Mama  Cooper 
isn't  living  high  on  Jackie's  earnings.     Nor  is  Jackie. 

Now,  inasmuch  as  we've  made  that  crack  about  the  state  of 
California  keeping  a  sharp  legal  eye  on  the  money  the  kid  stars 
make,  it's  only  fair  to  digress  a  moment — and  this  is  as  good  a 
place  as  any  for  digressing — to  give  credit  where  credit  is  due. 

That  is  to  say,  that  in  the  great  majority  of  cases,  the  parents 
of  these  movie  children  are  honestly  and  honorably  unselfish  in 
their  zeal  for  their  children's  welfare  and  happiness  and  profit. 
With  but  a  few  glaring  exceptions,  the  parents  of  the  little  ones 
have  no  wish  to  profit,  themselves,  from  what  the  tots  make. 

To  such  parents  could  be  safely  entrusted  their  child's  earn- 
ings. But  because  there's  no  hundred  per  cent  rule — even 
among  parents — the  state  of  California  has  seen  to  it  that  these 

salaries  have  the  law's 
protection. 


IN  the  first  place,  no 
child  actor  can  contract 
to  play  for  any  movie 
firm  without  the  ap- 
proval of  a  superior 
judge.  Jackie  Cooper's 
contract,  whereby  he  gets 
that  fifteen  hundred  dol- 
lars a  week  from  M-G-M, 
had  to  have  a  court  okay. 
Then,  in  the  second 
place,  the  mere  fact  that 
Mabel  Cooper  is  Jackie's 
mother  is  not  enough  in 
the  eyes  of  the  courts  to 
permit  her  to  spend  the 
salary  check  as  she  sees 
fit.  No — Mrs.  Cooper 
had  first  to  apply  for  and 
be  appointed  Jackie's 
legal  guardian  before  the 
courts  would  allow  her 
to  handle  her  own  son's 
earnings!  And  now,  as 
legal  guardian,  she  is  ac- 
countable to  the  courts

L>ili  Dramatizes  Her  Gowns 


r 


A  Fashion  Preview  for  You 
From  "The  Match  King" 


Above  you  see  how  Lili's 
velvet  cape  is  worn  under 
the  beaded  collar.   Clever! 


Lili  Damita  (that's  the  new  spelling), 
with  true  French  chic,  dares  to  wear 
gowns  that  strikingly  elaborate  current 
trends.  This  gown  is  white  velvet  with 
sweeping  train.  The  high  fitted  bodice 
is  quite  Empire  in  line.  Beading  on 
the  collar  is  repeated  on  the  short 
white  gloves.  The  cape,  held  in  her 
hand,  is  trimmed  with  coque  feathers 


Looks  like  Garbo,  doesn't  she?  It's 
Lili,  however,  in  another  of  the  unusual 
costumes  from  "The  Match  King." 
This  is  a  pajama  ensemble  in  navy 
crepe,  white  pique  and  plaid  starched 
chiffon.  There's  a  gay  nineties  air  to 
the  blouse  and  vest-like  jacket  which 
is  amusing— and  note  the  watch  fob 
that  dangles  from  a  small  vest  pocket 


The  graceful  charm 
of  fringe  is  being 
rediscovered.  Here 
Lili  gives  it  a 
dramatic  debut  on 
a  gown  of  pale  blue 
crepe.  The  fringe 
borders  the  straight 
skirt  deeply  and  is 
used  again  to  cover 
the  sleeves  and 
shoulders.  Note  the 
throat-high  collar 
line.     It's  popular

Little  Janet  had  a  fling  at  big  drama  in  "The 
Man  Who  Came  Back."  Yet  the  picture  did  not 
bring  nearly  so  much  money  into  the  box-office 
as  did  other  Janet  Gaynor-Charlie  Farrell  films 


But  "Daddy  Long  Legs"  was  a  sensation.  Here 
she  is  in  a  typical  Gaynor  moment  with  Warner 
Baxter.  This  is  what  the  critical  audience  wants 
and  expects  from  Janet.     She  knows  it  now 


Ihey  say    JNIo,  JNIo,  Janet 


WITH  the  possible  exception  of  Garbo,  there  has 
been  more  bunk  written  about  Janet  Gaynor  than 
any  other  ten  stars.  Something  seems  to  happen 
to  writers — particularly  men,  although  women  are 
not  immune — when  they  are  ushered  into  the  presence  of  this 
girl  with  her  child's  face  and  her  child's  voice — and  they  rush 
madly  to  their  typewriters  to  go  completely  ga-ga  with  words 
like  "wistful,"  "fragile"  and  "flower-like." 

Nothing  could  be  less  like  Gaynor  than  most  of  these 
effusions.  Wistful,  fragile  and  flower-like  she  looks,  but  be- 
neath those  tousled  curls  is  the  brain  of  a  clever,  shrewd,  in- 
telligent woman.  I'll  wager  that  more  than  once  as  Janet 
stands  before  her  mirror  she  has  rued  the  day  when  her  lips 
decided  to  form  into  an  adorable  pout  and  her  eyes  took  on  the 
innocence  of  a  nine-weeks-old  kitten.  For  Janet  wants  to  act. 
She  covets  roles  like  those  played  by 
Norma  Shearer,  Constance  Bennett 
and  Joan  Crawford.  She  has  told 
her  friends  that  she  wants  to  do 
something  to  prove  she  has  a  few 
brains  and  is  not  just  the  cute  little 
adolescent  girl  she  has  created  upon 
the  screen. 

This  has  been  going  on  for  years, 
this  struggle  of  hers  to  do  something 
different  on  the  screen.  But  now  she 
is  licked — just  plainly  licked,  and  she

told  her  that  she  could  do  something  besides  those  sugary 
roles.  But  the  public  won't  let  her.  That  portentous  "they" 
that  looms  large  in  the  career  of  every  star  has  said,  "No, 
Janet — emphatically  no!  We  want  you  to  remain  our  ideal, 
our  one  steadfast  star  in  the  sky  of  flashing,  brilliant  comets." 
So  Janet,  submitting  at  last,  too  weary  to  fight  against  her 
flower-like  screen  personality  any  longer,  is  making  "Tess  of 
the  Storm  Country" — and  she  hopes  "they"  like  it! 

Let's  glance  back  briefly  over  Janet's  career.  You  already 
know  it,  but  I  want  to  point  out  a  few  items  that  will  make  you  see 
how  hard  she  has  struggled  and  why  she  can  struggle  no  longer. 
"7th  Heaven"  started  it.  And  from  then  on  she  was  Diane 
in  every  film.  Sometimes  Diane  was  in  an  orphanage,  some- 
times she  was  a  little  immigrant  girl,  but  she  was  always  Diane. 
And  when  Janet  realized  this,  she  played  her  trump  card  and 
refused  to  work.  You  remember 
how  she  fled  to  Hawaii  and  swore 
that  until  she  could  play  the  parts 
she  wanted,  she  would  not  come 
back. 

The  company  arbitrated  for  her 
return,  promising  her  a  different 
type  of  picture.  She  and  Charlie 
Farrell  made  that  different  picture — 
"The  Man  Who  Came  Back." 
Compared  with  the  money  brought 
in  by  the  other  Gaynor-Farrell  films, 
it  was  a  flop.  And  she  went  back  to 
screen  sweetness.

A  BILL  OF  DIVORCEMENT—  RKO-Radio 


THIS  picture  makes  history.  Not  since  Greta  Garbo 
first  flashed  before  screen  audiences  in  "The  Torrent'' 
has  anything  happened  like  this  Katharine  Hepburn.  This 
girl  from  the  New  York  stage  is  not  only  a  fine  actress — she 
is  a  great  personality.  Not  beautiful,  measured  by  Holly- 
wood standards,  she  has  something  more  than  beauty — that 
thing,  whatever  it  is,  that  makes  the  great,  great. 

In  giving  her  first  mention,  we  do  not  mean  to  take  the 
glory  from  John  Barrymore  who  gives  the  greatest  per- 
formance of  his  life.  Billie  Burke,  who  plays  his  wife,  reaches 
dramatic  heights  of  which  you  would  not  think  her  capable. 
David  Manners  and  Paul  Cavanagh  are  excellent. 

The  story  is  unrelieved  by  humor,  insanity  is  its  theme, 
but  it  is  terrific  in  its  power.

HAT  CHECK  GIRL-Fox 


THE  story  is  old,  but  the  treatment  is  not.  For  it  is  all 
done  with  so  much  sparkle  and  pep.  Lavish  scenes,  too. 
C.  B.  De  Mille  in  his  palmiest  days  couldn't  have  designed  a 
better  bathroom.  It  is  entertainment  from  beginning  to  end. 

The  role  of  the  pert  little  hat  check  girl  is  right  up  Sally 
Eilers'  alley,  and  she  leaves  nothing  undone  to  give  the  part 
zip  and  dash.  Equally  good  is  Ben  Lyon's  work.  He's 
the  wise-cracking  son  of  a  millionaire.  Sure,  there's  a 
millionaire's  son  and  a  gangster,  a  columnist  and  a  boot- 
legger. 

All  your  old  favorites,  but  they  seem  new  because  the 
picture  is  so  clever. 

Ginger  Rogers  and  Monroe  Owsley  do  their  share  to 
keep  things  lively.    You'll  like  this  one.

A  Review  of  the  New  Pictures 


* 


SMILIN'  THROUGH— M-G-M 


GORGEOUS  as  is  the  production,  delicate  and  charming 
as  is  every  scene,  great  as  the  performance  is  of  each 
member  of  the  cast — this  is  Norma  Shearer's  picture,  and 
the  one  adjective  that  comes  to  mind  upon  seeing  her  is 
"splendid."  That  Norma  could  change  so  suddenly  from 
the  sophisticated  heroines  which  she  has  been  creating 
lately,  to  this  charming,  old-fashioned  girl,  is  a  great  tribute 
to  her  versatility. 

And  she  followed  the  never-to-be-forgotten  performances 
of  Jane  Cowl  (on  the  stage)  and  Norma  Talmadge  in  the 
silent  pictures. 

This,  as  you  recall,  is  a  love  story,  but  it  is  more  than  just 
that — it  is  a  little  yarn  that  makes  you  forget  completely 
all  the  sordidness  and  ugliness  of  the  world.  It  leaves  you 
refreshed  and  inspired,  in  spite  of  its  poignant  ending. 

Leslie  Howard,  first  as  the  young  lover  and  then  as  the 
elderly  uncle,  gives  a  performance  that  will  linger  long 
after  you  have  forgotten  the  picture.  Fredric  March  is 
perfect.  And  as  for  O.  P.  Heggie — well,  they  don't  make 
character  actors  any  better. 

The  piece  as  a  whole  is  done  with  a  lightness  of  touch  for 
which  its  director,  Sidney  Franklin,  can  take  a  bow.  Charm 
is  its  keynote.

WASHINGTON  MERR Y-GO-ROUND— Columbia 


BECAUSE  all  conversational  roads  lead  to  politics,  the 
movies  undoubtedly  sought  to  capitalize  upon  the  presi- 
dential election,  but  this  one  doesn't  need  to  depend  upon  a 
national  issue  to  put  it  over.  The  film  stands  on  its  own 
two  feet  as  entertainment. 

Actor  Lee  Tracy  and  Director  Jimmy  Cruze!  This  com- 
pletes Lee's  gradual  climb  and  places  him  on  a  very  high 
pinnacle;  it  puts  Jimmy  Cruze  back  in  the  front  rank  of 
directors.  Constance  Cummings  emerges  from  her  adoles- 
cent days  of  acting  into  smooth  and  capable  maturity.  Alan 
Dinehart  takes  his  place  as  a  forceful  screen  actor  by  his 
portrayal  of  a  political  dictator. 

The  story  tears  the  veil  Irom  conditions  in  this  country 
and  will  cause  a  lot  of  hot-headed  arguments. 

A  young  congressman  goes  to  Washington  on  purchased 
votes.  His  object  is  to  double-cross  his  gang  in  the  interest 
of  his  country.  What  he  finds  in  Washington  makes  the 
work  of  his  gang  seem  tame.  The  subject  has  not  been 
handled  with  kid  gloves.  Instead,  the  director  hammers 
home  his  truths  with  brass  knuckles. 

You'll  find  yourself  immensely  excited  by  "Washington 
Merry-Go-Round";  you'll  also  find  scenes  that  make  you 
laugh  and  there  are  some  very  pathetic  moments.     See  it!

PHANTOM  PRESIDENT— Paramount 


IF  you're  laugh-hungry,  don't  miss  this  riot  of  political 
farce,  which  introduces  George  M.  (flag  waving)  Cohan 
to  the  talking  screen.  George  is  a  scream  in  a  dual  role 
that  allows  him  to  play  both  a  stodgy  bank  president — a 
presidential  candidate — and  his  double  who  thinks  this 
country  needs  more  pep  and  personality  in  politics. 

Jimmy  Durante — laughing  already?  Well,  Jimmy  is  the 
double's  pal  who  crashes  the  convention  hall  and  causes  a 
riot.  His  songs  are  great,  done  in  the  inimitable  Durante 
manner.  Claudette  Colbert,  who  hasn't  much  to  do,  adds  a 
touch  of  beauty  to  the  production. 

Singing  and  dancing  only  add  to  the  sparkle  of  this  film. 
It's  utter  nonsense,  of  course,  and  just  the  sort  of  thing  to 
give  you  one  swell  evening's  entertainment.    Don't  miss  it.

RAIN— United  Artists 


JOAN  CRAWFORD  as  Sadie  Thompson!  It  was  a  tough 
assignment,  «for  Jeanne  Eagels  lives  in  the  minds  of  all 
theater-goers  as  the  perfect  Sadie;  and  who  can  forget 
Gloria  Swanson  in  the  silent  movie  version?  Joan  had  never 
seen  either  of  these  actresses'  performances.  She  went  into 
the  picture  with  no  preconceived  ideas  and  she  has  emerged 
as  a  dramatic  and  florid  Sadie.  Her  performance  is  fraught 
with  all  the  passions  that  made  Sadie  what  she  is,  but  her 
make-up  changes  too  suddenly  when  she  reforms. 

Everyone  knows  the  story  of  the  lady  of  easy  virtue  who 
accomplishes  the  downfall  of  a  blue-nosed  reformer — played 
with  beautiful  restraint  by  Walter  Huston. 

William  Gargan  has  very  little  to  do,  but  he  does  that 
"little"  well.

THE  SIGHT 
OF  JUNE  13— 

Paramount 


THIS  picture  attempts  to  de-glamourize  Marlene  Dietrich. 
She  is  a  down-to-earth  person  and  is  exotic  only  in  a  few 
sequences.  But  her  exotic  scenes  remain  the  best  and  you  are 
not  quite  convinced  by  her  other  type  of  work.  It  is  a  mother 
love  story,  and  besides  smooth  direction,  there  is  the  unfor- 
getable  Herbert  Marshall  as  the  soul-torn  husband,  and 
charming  little  Dickie  Moore. 


HERE'S  another  "different"  picture.  It's  breezy  with 
new  situations,  new  ideas  and  a  new  plot.  The  entire 
action  concerns  the  events  that  happen  in  an  average,  everyday 
neighborhood  on  a  certain  night  in  June.  Each  actor  fits  his 
role  perfectly.  Charlie  Grapewin  is  the  real  McCoy  as  the 
meddling  old  grandpap,  while  Adrianne  Allen,  Lila  Lee,  Mary 
Boland,  Charles  Ruggles  and  Clive  Brook  are  all  splendid.

THIS  is  the  first  of  the  pictures  dealing  with  prison  chain 
gangs  and  a  whole  flock  of  them  are  coming  along.  It 
isn't  a  pleasant  picture,  for  its  brutal  power  is  in  every  reel 
and  no  morbid  detail  has  been  left  out.  However,  Richard  Dix 
does  his  most  spectacular  acting  job  since  "Cimarron,"  and 
you'll  miss  something  if  you  don't  see  him.  But  leave  the 
children  at  home. 


HERE'S  an  average  little  picture  that  will  give  you  a 
pleasant  enough  evening.  Loretta  Young  is  as  lovely  as 
you've  ever  seen  her  as  the  young  church  organist  who  falls 
for  the  city  boy.  She  follows  her  sweetheart,  played  by  David 
Manners,  only  to  find  that  he's  engaged  to  his  boss's  daughter. 
George  Brent  and  Una  Merkel  do  good  jobs  and  there  are  some 
mighty  interesting  new  angles  to  the  picture.

GUARANTEED  to  make  you  cry  for  fifty  minutes.  Every- 
one in  the  cast  cries,  so  why  shouldn't  you?  A  bunch  of 
capable  weepers  are  gathered  together,  including  little  Jackie 
Searl,  Jean  Hersholt,  Claudia  Dell  and  J.  Farrell  MacDonald. 
The  story  concerns  a  widower  who  takes  the  responsibility  of 
bringing  up  a  motherless  child.  Jackie  Searl,  usually  cast  in 
comedy  roles,  has  a  chance  at  drama  this  time.

HERE  is  horse  opera  de  luxe — the  kind  Bill  Hart  used  to 
make.  The  picture  is  chuck-full  of  shooting,  kidnaping 
and  cattle  rustling,  thanks  to  the  villainous  efforts  of  David 
Landau  and  Guinn  Williams.  But  virtue  must  triumph  and 
does  with  the  aid  of  Sally  Blane,  Randolph  Scott,  J.  Farrell 
MacDonald  and  Vincent  Barnett.  If  you  like  action,  you  will 
get  it  in  this  picture,  and  plenty.

CROOKED 
CIRCLE—

A  FEARLESS  expose  of  police  methods  and  the  crooked 
power  behind  the  cop,  dramatically  and  forcefully  told. 
Eric  Linden  is  great  as  a  bellhop  who  witnesses  a  gang  murder, 
is  forced  to  take  the  blame  and  is  beaten  into  a  confession  by 
the  police.  It's  a  gripping,  timely  story  which  should  stir  every 
citizen.  Sidney  Fox,  Frank  Sheridan  and  others  give  power- 
ful performances. 


A  SNAPPY  little  mystery  comedy  with  plenty  of  fun, 
some  spooky  happenings,  and  a  share  of  laughs.  A  lot 
of  the  action  takes  place  in  a  haunted  house,  with  ZaSu  Pitts 
as  a  maid  and  Jimmie  Gleason  as  a  cop  turning  in  more  than 
their  quota  of  laughs.  Ben  Lyon  and  Irene  Purcell  supply  the 
romance.  There  are  some  thrilling  surprises  in  store  at  the 
end  of  the  picture.     Good  stuff.

THE  THRILL 
OF  YOUTH—

Invincible 


A  SLOW  moving  story  about  a  novelist,  his  self-sacrificing 
wife,  another  woman  and  the  son  who  brings  mama  and 
papa  back  together  again.  Lilyan  Tashman's  amazing  clothes 
and  Mary  Astor's  charm  and  sincerity  almost  save  this  from 
the  doldrums — but  not  quite.  Kenneth  MacKenna,  Kay 
Francis'  husband,  leaves  his  directorial  megaphone  to  act  in 
this  one.   The  picture  gets  off  to  a  good  start;  too  bad  it  misses. 


FAIR  entertainment,  although  not  very  logical  in  plot.  The 
rather  rambling  story  is  about  a  young  couple  and  an  older 
pair  who  finally  find  their  way  to  happiness.  Lucy  Beaumont 
is  fine  as  an  indulgent  grandmother,  and  you'll  recognize  two 
other  favorites  of  silent  days — Ethel  Clayton  and  Bryant 
Washburn.  Cast  includes  June  Clyde,  Allen  Vincent,  Matty 
Kemp,  Dorothy  Peterson,  George  Irving  and  Tom  Ricketts.

HANDU,  the  magician  of  the  radio,  comes  to  the  screen, 
a  mysterious,  forceful  character  in  an  exciting  picture. 
Elaborate  and  eerie  settings  add  greatly  to  the  effect,  while 
Edmund  Lowe  well  interprets  the  role  of  Chandu,  modern 
worker  of  magic.  Bela  Lugosi  makes  a  shivering  Roxor  who 
steals  the  death  ray.  Ooh!  What  awful  things  happen.  The 
kids  and  dad,  too,  will  thrill  to  this  one. 


BETTER  take  a  hot-water  bottle  with  you,  to  counteract  the 
chills  that  will  race  down  your  spine.  For  here  is  a  real 
murder  mystery  thriller,  but  with  bright  dialogue  and  enough 
comedy  to  offset  the  horror.  Frances  Rich  (daughter  of  Irene) 
shines  in  a  supporting  role,  her  first.  Ginger  Rogers  and  Lyle 
Talbot  are  good,  but  J.  Farrell  MacDonald  very  nearly 
steals  the  show.  [  additional  reviews  on  page  118  ]

Harold    Offers  $1000™  To 

Photoplay  Readers  for  Gags 


Here  is  one  little  gag 
from  "Movie  Crazy," 
Harold  Lloyd's  newest 
comedy,  that  sets  the 
audience  off  on  a  round 
of  giggles.  It  occurs 
during  a  fight  scene  be- 
tween Harold  and  the 
bold,  bad  villain,  Ken- 
neth Thomson.  They 
battle  all  over  a  studio 
set,  which  represents  a 
ship.  Just  when  Harold 
seemingly  has  the  ad- 
vantage, a  life-saver  falls 
over  Harold's  head  and, 
pinning  his  arms  at  his 
side,  prevents  him  from 
returning  the  punches 
delivered  by  his  adver- 
sary. Harold's  bewilder- 
ment at  his  plight  is  a 
scream.  Maybe  you  can 
think  up  a  gag  that  is 
just  as  funny  as  this  one. 
Read  this  page  and  the 
rules  and  get  in  on  the 
most  fun  you  ever  had 


WHAT  is  this — a  gag?  You  should  see  the  Movie 
Crazy  Contest  Editor  being  swamped  with  hun- 
dreds and  hundreds  of  gag  ideas.  The  postman's 
bag  is  simply  bulging  with  hilarious  situations. 
But  the  funny  part  is  that  everybody  is  happy  about  it. 

And  another  joyous  thing  is  that  you  still  have  plenty  of  time 
to  compete  for  the  107  cash  prizes  that  are  being  offered  to  you 
by  Harold  Lloyd.    Here's  what  it's  all  about. 

Harold  Lloyd  believes  that  everybody  has  at  some  time  or 
other  seen  or  imagined  some  amusing  situation  that  would,  if 
used  in  a  comedy,  bring  chuckles  and  giggles  and  howls  from  an 
audience.  And  we'll  make  a  wager  that  most  of  you  have  said, 
after  seeing  movie  comedies,  "  Why,  I  could  think  up  something 
as  funny  as  that." 

So  here's  your  chance.  Think  up  something  amusing,  write 
it  down  as  briefly  as  possible  (five  hundred  words  or  less),  don't 
bother  to  use  any  high-flown  language,  keep  it  simple  and  to 
the  point,  and  mail  it  in  to  the  Movie  Crazy  Contest  Editor, 
Photoplay  Magazine,  221  West  57th  Street,  New  York  City. 

A  gag  is  simply  a  funny  situation.  It  may  involve  one  person 
or  a  group  of  people.  Look  at  the  picture  at  the  top  of  this  page. 
Read  the  caption.     There  you  find  an  example  of  a  good  gag. 

The  gag  ideas  can  be  figments  of  your  imagination  or  they 
can  be  actual  happenings.  There  are  no  restrictions  placed  on 
the  type  of  humor  or  the  situations  submitted  in  this  contest, 
except  that  in  the  final  judging  the  possibilities  of  the  sugges- 
tions from  the  point  of  view  of  their  application  to  a  motion 
picture  will  be  of  prime  importance. 


Harold  Lloyd  comedies  are  noted  for  their  excellent  gags. 
"  Movie  Crazy,"  his  latest,  is  a  howl  from  start  to  finish.  But 
Harold  believes  that  there  are  just  as  good  gags  in  the  sea  as 
have  ever  been  filmed,  so  he  is  offering  every  reader  of  Photo- 
play an  opportunity  to  share  in  the  107  prizes  which  he  is 
giving  for  this  contest.  The  awards  follow:  First  prize,  S250; 
second  prize,  $100;  third  prize,  S50;  four  prizes  of  S25  each;  one 
hundred  prizes  of  $5  each.  If  you  could  use  some  extra  money, 
put  on  your  thinking  cap  and  get  busy  working  out  gags. 

You  can  send  in  as  many  as  you  like,  but  remember  that  the 
contest  closes  November  15,  which  means  that  your  gag  ideas 
must  be  mailed  in  time  to  reach  the  Movie  Crazy  Contest 
Editor  by  November  15.  Gag  ideas  received  after  that  date 
cannot  be  considered. 

But  before  you  send  in  your  contributions,  be  sure  to  turn 
to  page  125  of  this  magazine  and  read  the  rules  carefully.  This 
is  most  important,  since  if  you  do  not  abide  by  the  rules,  a 
grand  gag  of  yours  may  be  disqualified.  The  judges  are  a  com- 
mittee composed  of  Harold  Lloyd  and  selected  members  of 
Photoplay's  editorial  staff. 

Here's  your  chance — you  folks  who  haven't  yet  sent  in  your 
gag  ideas.  And  you  who  have  already  submitted  situations  can 
send  in  some  more.    The  more  the  merrier,  for  all  concerned. 

The  judges  assure  you  that  the  announcement  of  awards  will 
be  made  as  soon  as  possible.  They  do  not  want  to  keep  you  in 
suspense  longer  than  is  absolutely  necessary,  but  if  you  could 
see  the  deluge  of  gag  ideas  that  have  been  pouring  in,  you 
would  be  lenient  and  not  too  impatient.

HATS  are  still  tipped  according  to 
Hollywood's  smartest  stars — but  not 
as  much!  The  new  line  is  up  in  back  with

trimming  used  in  an  unusual  way.  How- 
ever, the  same  dress  has  been  made  up 
for  you  in  one  of  the  new  rough  crinkle 
crepes  with  white  silk  pique  trimming — 
very  stunning.  I  suggest  that  you  choose 
it  in  Rhum  brown  with  the  white  accent. 
And  wear  one  of  those  new  brown- 
ish tones  in  hosiery,  as  does  Constance.

BUTTONS  are  found  everywhere  in 
fashion  these  days — they  even  find  their 
way  to  hats.  Myrna  Loy  thinks  this  arrange- 
ment of  buttons  on  her  brown  suede  beret 
suggests  a  Spanish  comb — it  does,  don't 
you  think?  She  wears  this  hat,  brown  suede 
gloves  and  shoes  with  one  of  those  new 
three-quarter  fur  coats  which  are  seen 
about  Hollywood — I  counted  a  dozen  or 
more  at  the  Brown  Derby  the  other  noon. 
Myrna  s  coat  is  white  kid — you  can  imagine 
how  effective  the  brown  accessories  look. 
The    beret   is   bloused  over  the   forehead. 


THE  photograph  in  the 
group  at  left  shows 
Dorothy  Jordan  wearing 
an  attractive  dress  from  her 
new  picture  "That's  My 
Boy.''  Two-piece,  it  is 
made  of  checked  ostrich 
woolen  in  two  colors.  A 
small  high  collar  of  white 
galyak  is  brought  through 
a  slash  in  the  blouse  to 
form  a  loop  end  atone  side.

'  Is  also  Dorothy  Jordan 
in  another  smart  costume 
from  the  same  picture. 
Dorothy  plays  the  role  of  a 
young  college  girl  so  her 
clothes  are  appropriately 
youthful.  This  is  a  three- 
piece  suit.  The  high  waist- 
ed  skirt  and  the  short  jacket 
are  a  new  wool  crepe  while 
the  blouse  is  a  novelty 
knitted  fabric.  Quite  inter- 
esting, the  sash  and  epaulets. 


LET  THE  SCREEN  TELL 
YOU  WHAT'S  NEW 


HERE,  at  right,  is 
the  different'' 
suit.  A  brief  jacket 
tops  a  satin  blouse 
and  slim  skirt  of 
gray  woolen. 
Brown  fur  makes 
gay  shoulder 
epaulets  and  the 
uniquely  notched 
collar.  Miriam 
Hopkins  wears 
it  in  "Trouble 
in    Paradise." 


SATIN  is  much  seen  in 
both  costumes  and 
accents.  Above  a  bag 
and  belt  set  are  fash- 
ioned of  black  satin 
braid.  For  afternoon  an 
oxford  tie  of  suede  and 
kid  has  a  clever  side 
bow.  And  the  unusual 
cut  makes  your  foot 
look  unbelievably  small  I 


MAGINE  being  able  to  have  this 
stunning  costume  of  Karen  Morley's! 
She  wears  it  in  The  Phantom  of  Crest- 
wood''  but  you  may  wear  it  all  winter 
either  with  or  without  its  fur  trimmed 
cape  that  buttons  so  snugly  about  the 
throat.  Karen's  dress  is  gray  woolen 
(all  the  stars  are  wearing  gray),  trimmed 
with  bands  of  gray  fox  on  the  cape  and 
sleeves.     A  leather  belt  is  worn   high. 


A  TOUCH  of  velvet  assures  success 
to  costumes  and  accessories  this 
year.  Have  you  heard  of  velvet  gloves? 
Well,  Madge  Evans,  at  left,  wears  suede 
gloves  trimmed  with  velvet  to  match  her 
velvet  scarf.  Her  accessories  are  black, 
costume  gray.  Try  brown  with  gray,  too. 


A  BO VE  is  a  sketch  of 
'  Mhe  quaint  cape  that 
completes  Marian 
Marsh's  evening  ensem- 
ble. It  is  velvet  with  high 
collar  tying  in  a  bow. 
The  extra  collar  is  a 
new  ermine-like   velvet. 


FORMAL,  yet  not  too 
'  much  so,  is  the  creed  of 
new  evening  fashions. 
Marian  Marsh  follows 
this  theory  in  a  demure 
black  velvet  frock  that 
reaches  to  the  throat  in 
front  but  opens  deeply 
at  back.  Rounded  puff 
sleeves  in  white  are 
made  of  an  effective  new 
velvet  like  ermine.  To 
be  seen  in  "Sport  Page." 


CHARMING,  Southern  Dorothy  Jordan  with  her 
fair  skin  and  dark  hair  wears  black  and  white  for 
evening  with  perfection.  This  black  crepe  frock  is  her 
choice  for  dinner  in  "That's  My  Boy."  It  is  the  sort 
of  thing  you  must  have  this  winter  because  the  ruffled 
capelet,  covering  the  shoulders,  makes  it  wearable 
for  so  many  occasions.  White  ermine  edges  the  square 
neckline  and  a  bunch  of  white  violets  carries  the 
accent  to  the  waist.  Dorothy  likes  black  pumps  and 
sheer  beige  hose  with  this — note  the  complete 
simplicity  in  jewelry,  just  enough  for  informal  gowns. 


NECKLINE  AND  SLEEVES 

HOLD  HOLLYWOOD'S 

ATTENTION 


pHECKED  wool  os- 
> — trich  and  wool  crepe 
get  together  to  make  this 
good  looking  dress  for 
Marian  Marsh — and  you! 
The  neckline  is  particu- 
larly flattering,  the  metal 
buttons  and  the  belt  add- 
ing a  certain  dash  to  the 
whole  effect.  Note  how 
the  sleeves  look  like 
those  of  an  old-fashioned 
guimpe.  Marian  wears 
this  in  "Sport  Page/'  al- 
so. Her  simple  brimmed 
felt  is  an  excellent  detail. 


THE  belt  that  just  goes  across  the  back 
is  a  new  fashion  trick.  Marian  Marsh 
who  plays  the  role  of  fashion  editor  in 
Sport  Page''  considers  this  one  of  the 
cleverest  details  of  the  brown  and  beige 
frock  above.  Don't  overlook  the  high 
neckline  with  its  tie  closing  at  back  when 
you  see  the  picture.  The  dress  is  quite 
simple  in  line.  Marian's  dress  is  a  plaid 
woolen  but  you  will  want  it  in  one  of 
the  stunning  color  combinations  in  silk  as 
it  has  been  reproduced.   (Very  wearable.) 


THE  photograph  of  Dorothy  Jordan  shows  you  the 
'  flattering  way  gray  fox  trims  the  top  of  the  gray 
woolen  coat  she  wears  in  "That's  My  Boy.'"  It  gives 
you  a  close-up  of  that  small  standing  collar  that  buttons 
tight  about  the  neck.  The  contrast  of  the  luxurious  fox 
with  the  severe  but  youthful  collar  line  is  unique.  The 
fox  is  so  arranged  on  collar  and  sleeves  that  it  suggests 
an  almost  cape-like  effect.    I  predict  you  will  all  want  it! 


N  the  sketch  at  right,  behold  the  full  length  view  of 
'this  striking  coat.  The  arrangement  of  the  silver 
buttons  gives  a  slim  fitted  line  even  though  the  skirt 
is  quite  straight.    Dorothy's  turban  is  rough  silk  crepe.

NOW  listen,  Ethel!  Calm  yourself,  John !  We  know  that  all  three 
of  you  Barrymores  are  playing  in  "Rasputin,"  and  that  we  shouldn't 
run  Lionel's  picture  without  including  you  folks,  too,  but  honestly  we 
couldn't  resist  this  grand  portrait.  We  know  it's  okay  with  you,  Ethel, 
for  didn't  you  once  admit  that  Lionel  was  the  best  actor  of  the  lot? 


Lo.  the  Poor  Ku 


ssian 


MOSCOW  .  .  .  Imagine  a  coun- 
try whose  one  hundred  and 
fifty  million  inhabitants  have 
never  heard  of  Garbo  and  to 
whom  Gable  is  a  meaningless  sound! 
Imagine  these  same  people  waiting  in 
line  before  twenty-seven  thousand  thea- 
ters to  see  films  practically  devoid  of 
love  scenes! 

That's  Russia. 

Not  only  do  they  line  up.  If  they 
want  to  see  the  more  popular  pictures, 
they  have  to  buy  tickets  hours  in  ad- 
vance. And  all  these  hardships  just  to 
see  one  picture — no  Mickey  Mouse,  no 
news  reel. 

It  isn't  because  they  like  talkies,  for  there  are  only  ninety- 
two  theaters  with  talkie  equipment  in  the  entire  country,  and 
they  are  not  entertaining — at  least  from  the  viewpoint  of 
Americans.  These  movies  may  not  satisfy  a  desire  for  love 
scenes,  but  appetites  are  certainly  taken  care  of.  In  spite  of 
numerous  rumors  of  food  shortage,  there  is  a  buffet  in  every 
theater — a  buffet  which  does  a  land  office  business. 

The  popularity  of  the  "  Kino,"  as  it  is  called  here,  seems 
strange  to  an  American  who  is  Hollywood  conscious.  But  to 
the  Russian,  who  knows  nothing  better,  it  offers  relaxation  and 
temporary  relief  from  the  strain  of  a  life  full  of  difficulties. 

There  are  no  stars.  If  anyone,  it  is  the  director  who  is 
glorified,  and  the  cameraman  comes  in  for  a  large  share  of  the 
honors.  If  they  find  that  an  individual  is  getting  too  much 
attention  from  the  public,  he  is  thereafter  given  minor  parts. 

A  good  example  is  the  versatile  youngster,  Tzyyan  Kvrla, 
who  played  the  part  of  Mustapha  in  "The  Road  to  Life." 
This  film  was  released  over  a  year  ago  and  he  immediately  took 
with  the  public.  So  much  so  that  they  still  talk  about  him. 
But  since  then  he  has  appeared  in  no  picture,  and  it  is  next  to 
impossible  to  get  a  photograph  of  him. 

This  system  discourages  some  would-be  stars.  An  outstand- 
ing case  is  that  of  Alex- 
andra Petrova.  She  is  a 
dreamy-eyed  brunette  of 
the  Pola  Negri  type.  Pe- 
trova left  the  movies  flat 
two  years  ago,  disap- 
pointed when  she  found 
she  could  be  no  more 
than  one  of  many.  The 
Kino  is  getting  along 
quite  well  without  her. 


SHE  is  also  happy,  for 
she  has  realized  one  of 
her  ambitions  in  marry- 
ing a  German  engineer. 
One  of  her  prized  posses- 
sions is  a  1927  copy  of 
Photoplay  given  to  her 
by  a  friend.  She  likes  to 
look  through  it  at  times 
and  wonder  if  Hollywood 
would  have  been  kinder. 
There  are  no  rival  mo- 
tion picture  companies. 
All  productions  are  made 
under  government  con- 
trol. Hence  no  stars  are 
needed  as  box-office  at- 
tractions. Young  Rus- 
sians are  ardent  movie 
fans,  yet  when  you  ask 
them  who  their  favorites 
are  the  reply  is  usually 
Harold  Lloyd,  Douglas 
Fairbanks    and    Charlie 


He  is  allowed  no 
screen  favorites, 
but  he  does  get  his 
fill  of  buffet  lunch 

By  George 
Bra  bant,  Jr. 


Here's  the  sort  of  screen  idol 
that  makes  Russia's  feminine 
hearts  palpitate.  Known  as 
"the  Clark  Gable  of  Russia," 
and  the  biggest  star,  he  gets 
a  salary  much  less  than  that 
of  an  average  American  minor 
executive.  Nickolai  Batalov 
is  the  name  of  this  favorite 


Chaplin.  Never  do  they  give  the  name 
of  an  individual  Russian,  although  they 
may  give  the  name  of  a  Russian  film. 

In  Moscow,  American  productions  are 
shown  from  time  to  time,  but  no  Ameri- 
cans go  to  see  them  because  they  saw 
them  years  ago.  These  are  all  silent 
pictures,  usually  of  the  comedy  or  ad- 
venture type.  At  the  present  time, 
Fairbanks'  old  release,  "The  Son  of 
Zorro"  is  creating  a  stir  among  the 
Moscowites. 

Moscow  movie  theaters  bring  back 
vivid  memories  of  nickelodeon  days. 
Plush  seats  are  unheard  of,  and  the  Five 
Year  Plan  provides  for  no  gold-braided 
ushers.  Once  the  theater  is  darkened,  no  one  is  allowed  to  enter. 
Late-comers  with  reserved  seats  are  out  of  luck.  After  the 
single  picture  is  over,  one  audience  files  out,  and  the  next, 
which  has  been  regaling  itself  at  the  buffet,  rushes  in. 

There  are  no  motion  picture  publications.  Newspapers  do 
not  review  current  films,  but  they  do  run  advertisements  of 
them.  Picking  an  advertisement  at  random,  we  find  that  one 
of  the  outstanding  movie  houses  in  Moscow  is  showing  a  film 
which  they  call,  "The  Blade  of  Kurstenbrook,"  featuring 
Richard  Barthelmess  with  Dorothy  Mackaill. 

RUSSIAN  films  have  no  premieres,  as  the  word  is  understood 
in  the  United  States.  Opening  night  means  no  more  than 
any  other  night.  The  crowd  stands  in  line,  checks  its  rubbers 
and  galoshes,  and  files  in  just  as  at  any  other  time.  The  difficulty 
of  getting  seats  is  the  same  as  usual.  No  stars  arrive  heralded 
by  searchlights.  With  true  Slavic  calm  the  spectators  sit  with 
their  hats  and  coats  on,  reading  the  captions  aloud  to  each 
other.    If  alone  they  read  them  aloud,  anyway. 

But  no  matter  what  film  is  on,  whether  premiere  or  not,  they 
never  see  anything  which  might  tend  to  dissatisfy  them  with 
Communism,  for  the  Communists  believe  that  the  silver  screen 

is  mightier  than  the  pen 
where  a  backward  peo- 
ple is  concerned. 

This  is  one  of  the  rea- 
sons that  so  few  modern 
American  films  are 
shown.  Another  is  that 
they  are  too  expensive 
for  a  government  which 
needs  all  the  money  it 
can  get  for  foreign  ma- 
chinery, and  which  has 
no  trouble  selling  tickets 
for  its  own  films.  As  for 
showing  gangster  films, 
the  mere  mention  of 
them  is  enough  to  bring 
an  expression  of  utter 
dismay  to  the  face  of  any 
follower  of  Stalin. 

ONLYone  American 
actress  has  met  with 
any  kind  of  success  in  the 
Russian  kino  during  re- 
cent years.  Joan  Lyons 
came  to  Russia  with  a 
background  on  the 
American  stage  and 
screen.  She  found  get- 
ting into  Soviet  films 
quite  a  different  expe- 
rience from  making  the 
grade  in  Hollywood.  The

And  this  is  the  Greta  Garbo 
of  Russia,  Iiina  Nikolayevna 
Volodgo — how  would  you 
like  to  see  that  in  electric 
lights  in  front  of  a  theater? 
Whenever  she  becomes  too 
popular,  Soviet  officials

He  Orders  Ham 

And  Eggs 


HE  played  himself  in  his  first  picture,  "Blessed  Event," 
as  combination  orchestra  leader,  crooner  and  master 
of  ceremonies.  For  that's  exactly  what  Dick  Powell 
is.  Directly  from  the  Stanley  Theater  in  Pittsburgh 
comes  Dick  after  three  and  a  half  years  as  master  of  cere- 
monies.   And  still  he  smiles.    And  thinks  life  dandy. 

Born  in  a  little  town  in  Arkansas,  his  family  finally  moved 
into  the  big  city  of  Little  Rock  and  Dick's  career  was  on.  In 
the  daytime  he  worked  for  the  telephone  company.  At  nights 
he  sang  in  church  choirs. 

Then  he  received  an  offer  to  sing  and  play  a  banjo  with  an 
orchestra  in  Indianapolis.  There  was  only  one  slight  drawback 
to  the  offer.  He  couldn't  play  a  banjo.  A  horn,  a  saxophone 
or  a  piccolo,  yes.  But  not  a  banjo.  But  he  wanted  to  go,  so  he 
rushed  out,  bought  a  banjo  and  practiced  until  every  man, 
woman  and  child  was  glad  to  see  him  bound  for  Indianapolis, 
with  his  banjo  under  his  arm. 

From  there  he  went  to  the  Smuky  City,  where  he  did  a 
Gable  with  the  girls.  In  fact,  for  three  years  the  whole  town 
was  Dick  Powell  conscious. 

He's  boyish,  has  a  lot  of  charm,  wavy  hair  and  a  cute  smile. 
He's  a  regular  he-man. 

His  hands  are  large;  he  loves  ham  and  eggs;  plays  a  good 
game  of  golf  and  can  fly  a  plane  anywhere. 

Began  flying  lessons  early  one  morning  and  had  made  his  first 
solo  flight  before  dark. 

He  reads  popular  magazines,  and  spends  most  of  his  spare 
time  rehearsing. 

Has  a  five-year  contract  with  Warners  with  a  twelve-week 
vacation  clause  each  year. 

Was  borrowed  by  Fox  to  play  the  boy  in  Will  Rogers' pic- 
ture, "  Jubilo,"  because  the  boy  had  to  sing.  Then  they  cut 
out  all  the  songs  and  left  Dick  high  and  dry  with  a  straight 
part  for  the  first  time  in  his  life. 

He  lives  with  his  father  and  mother  in  Hollywood  and  if  the 
movie  thing  doesn't  turn  out  well,  he's  sure  of  one  thing. 

He  can  always  go  back  to  Pittsburgh. 


She  Won't  Take 
Exercise 


SHE'S  known  as  the  "woman  who  never  gets  her  man"'  in 
pictures.  But  she  gets  nearly  all  the  good  parts  going. 
Aline  MacMahon  came  to  Los  Angeles  and  kidded  Holly- 
wood from  the  stage  in  "Once  in  a  Lifetime."  She's  been 
in  movies  a  year  and  a  half  and  can't  see  why  people  ever 
kidded  them.     She  came  to  hoot  and  remained  to  toot. 

She  never  wears  a  dress  or  a  hat  anyone  would  give  a  second 
look  at,  and  yet  audiences  go  for  her  in  a  big  way.  It's  be- 
cause she's  real  and  natural. 

Born  in  McKeesport,  Pennsylvania,  she  received  her  educa- 
tion at  Erasmus  Hall  and  Barnard  College,  New  York,  then 
took  to  the  stage,  and  pestered  the  producers  'till  she  got  on. 

Hollywood  saw  the  laughable  dead  pan  of  .Aline  from  the 
stage  and  begged  her  to  stay  for  "  Five  Star  Final."  She  played 
it,  and  then  took  the  first  train  back  to  New  York. 

They  called  her  to  Hollywood  again  for  "The  Mouthpiece." 
And  again  she  trailed  back  to  Xew  York.  They  wired  franti- 
cally for  Aline  to  come  back  for  "Week  End  Marriage."  So 
she  gave  up  commuting  and  stayed. 

She  has  a  grand  sense  of  humor,  collects  old  china,  oriental 
jewelry  and  Chinese  art.  She  owns  no  pets,  no  yachts  or 
automobiles. 

Bridge  is  her  favorite  indoor  sport,  but  she'll  drop  a  hand 
anytime  to  watch  a  good  wrestling  match,  or  tennis  match. 
Her  eyes  are  very  blue,  her  hair  brown  and  she's  five  feet  eight 
inches  tall.    She  hasn't  the  least  bit  of  style,  but  isn't  bothered. 

But  she  does  like  fancy  foods.  The  fancier  the  better.  And 
loves  to  ride  on  bus  tops  and  wave  down  at  the  bewildered 
pedestrians  below.  Loathes  exercise  and  does  nothing  to  keep 
fit.     Yet  always  is. 

Her  latest  pictures  are  "Once  in  a  Lifetime"  and  "Silver 
Dollar."  They  always  have  another  role  waiting  for  Aline, 
who  doesn't  mind. 

Greta  Garbo  and  Marie  Dressier  are  her  favorite  movie  stars. 
And  Lunt  and  Fontanne  her  favorite  stage  stars.  She's  sane 
and  sensible  but  grand  fun.  And  is  happily  married  to  a  New 
York  architect. 


He  Yearns  To  Be 
Funny 


She  Reads  Comic 
Strips 


ARLINE  JUDGE,  that  cute  little  trick  in  "Are  These 
Our  Children?  "  is  just  nineteen,  looks  fourteen  and 
has  the  common  sense  of  forty. 

She  always  wanted  to  marry  a  man  who  was  gray 
at  the  temples  and  she  did.  Her  husband  is  Wesley  Ruggles, 
the  director.  Her  eyebrows,  with  the  exception  of  Clark 
Gable's  are  the  only  unplucked  ones  in  Hollywood.  She  wears 
no  color  on  her  finger  nails. 

She  began  her  career  as  a  singer  in  Jimmy  Durante's  night 
club  in  New  York.  Jimmy  called  her  "  Mousie."  Then  Arline 
was  the  "Sing  Something  Simple"  girl  in  "The  Second  Little 
Show,"  which  landed  her  in  Hollywood. 

She  loves  to  hang  curtains  and  will  take  down  and  hang  up 
curtains  by  the  hour.  Says  it  makes  her  feel  so  married.  She 
has  a  perfect  mania,  also,  for  painting  furniture  or  houses  or 
whatever's  around.  So  her  husband  bought  her  a  spray  gun 
and  rubber  gloves  and  she  resprayed  their  beach  house  six 
times  in  four  weeks. 

There  is  a  husky  determination  in  her  voice  that  belies  her 
lovely  little  face.  She  just  will  read  funny  papers.  She  hides 
funny  papers  under  all  the  rugs  and  pillows  until  she  has  time 
to  read  them. 

Ronald  Colman  is  her  favorite  star  and  she  has  always 
wanted  to  write  a  fan  letter  to  Ronald.  But  can't  get  up  the 
nerve.     Mitzi  Green  is  her  best  girl  friend. 

Arline  claps  loudly  at  the  movies  when  her  favorites  come  on 
the  screen.    And  try  to  stop  her  from  clapping. 

Every  Saturday  night  she  telephones  her  father  and  mother 
in  Bridgeport,  Conn.,  where  she  was  born.  She  wears  bright 
woolen  dresses  and  loves  red.  And  how  cute  she  looks  in  green. 
Arline  loves  fun  and  funny  stories  and  knows  two  herself  that 
are  darbs. 

Her  eyes  and  hair  are  dark  brown  and  she  washes  and  curls 
her  own  hair,  looking  as  comical  as  possible  with  it  all  wrapped 
up  in  bobbed  hair  pins. 

She  loves  the  kind  of  role  she  had  in  "Are  These  Our  Chil- 
dren?" and  wept  for  hours  when  she  saw  herself  in  "  Girl  Crazy." 


CHARLES  LAUGHTON  is  called  "the  English  Emil 
Jannings."    He  doesn't  mind,  only  he  thinks  Jannings 
is  a  consistently  better  actor.     Charles  has  plenty  of 
moments  himself.     He  speaks  with  a  decided  English 
accent,  wears  striped  shirts  and  loves  Yorkshire  pudding  and 
roast  beef.      Claims  his  American  cook  can  do  even  better  by 
the  Yorkshire  thing  than  his  English  one. 

He's  the  most  menacing  looking  creature  on  the  screen  and 
the  gentlest  off.  The  vastness  of  America  and  the  ardor  of  our 
fans  leave  him  breathless.  If  he  sees  that  strangers  recognize 
him,  he's  uneasy  and  frightened,  but  he  feels  the  little  Marys 
and  Jims  of  Kansas  are  more  important  to  his  career  than  a 
city  full  of  sophisticates. 

There  is  absolutely  no  difference  in  the  reaction  of  American 
and  English  audiences,  he  claims.  They  laugh  at  the  same 
things  and  cry  about  the  same  things.  And  even  shudder  at 
Charles'  stage  cussedness  in  exactly  the  same  spots. 

Born  in  Scarborough,  England,  he  decided  to  be  a  hotel 
keeper  after  his  schooling.  But  the  war  interfered  and  he 
emerged  from  the  conflict  with  a  desire  to  act.  So  he  acted. 
Came  to  the  New  York  stage  in  "Payment  Preferred,"  and 
was  an  instantaneous  sensation.  Paramount  brought  Charles 
and  his  ability  to  act  villains  with  a  ghastly  sincerity  to  "Devil 
and  the  Deep,"  with  Tallulah  Bankhead  and  Gary  Cooper,  in 
which  he  frightened  half  the  fan  world  into  spasms. 

He's  a  quiet,  soft  spoken  Englishman  who  is  pleased  and  a 
bit  skeptical  of  his  success  and  longs  for  his  country  home  in 
England.  And  can't  endure  too  much  publicity  ballyhoo. 
Says  all  actors  are  just  accidents  of  nature,  anyway,  so  why 
make  too  much  fuss  about  it?  Especially  before  he's  earned  it. 
Is  constantly  urging  the  publicity  department  to  tone  down, 
and  let  the  fans  do  the  praising.    If  any  should  be  done. 

He  lives  alone,  since  his  wife's  return  to  England,  in  a  hilltop 
bungalow,  and  watches  with  intense  interest  the  progress  of  a 
humming  bird's  nest  in  a  branch  beneath  his  window.  He  longs 
to  be  a  comedian  and  feels  sure  he'd  be  very  funny.  But  he's 
such  a  swell  menace,  no  one  will  let  him  even  try  to  be  funny.

Sylvia,  who  has 
molded  the  figures 
of  half  the  Holly- 
wood stars,  shows 
you,  with  her  own 
hands,  how  you  can 
squeeze    off    flesh 


I'VE  discovered  something.  The  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
letters  that  have  poured  in  to  me  since  I  have  been  writing 
these  articles  for  Photoplay  show  that  the  five  parts  of  a 
woman's  figure  that  need  reducing  most  are  the  hips,  bust, 
stomach,  legs  and  arms.  If  these  parts  of  your  body  are  okay, 
you  can  face  the  world  with  a  smile  and  walk  as  if  you  owned  it. 

So,  for  the  benefit  of  those  who  did  not  get  in  on  my  first 
articles,  I  am  going  to  repeat  the  salient  points  in  getting  rid  of 
flesh  on  those  vital  places.  And  you  who 
have  followed  my  instructions  carefully  can 
listen,  too.  It  won't  hurt  you  a  bit  to  re- 
fresh your  minds.  Besides,  I'm  going  to 
throw  in  a  few  new  things — just  for  good 
measure. 

Reducing  demands  a  combination  of 
three  things — diet,  exercise  and  massage. 
I  hate  that  word  massage.  It  sounds  mild, 
and  what  I'm  teaching  you  to  do  isn't  mild. 
At  least  you  won't  think  it  is  after  you  have 
tried  it — and  the  hundreds  of  stars  of  Holly- 
wood whom  I  slapped  and  pommeled  for  so 
long,  shaping  their  figures  into  beautiful 
lines,  don't  think  so  either.  The  general 
reducing  diet,  which  I  am  going  to  repeat  at 
the  end  of  this  article,  is  for  the  purpose  of 
keeping  you  fit,  as  well  as  reducing  you. 

Women  who  follow  my  instructions  get 
enough  to  eat  and,  therefore,  their  faces 
don't  have  that  gaunt,  wolfish,  hungry  look 
that  lots  of  diets  give  them.  The  exercises 
are  to  reduce  a  large  area  of  fat.  The  mas- 
sage— for  want  of  a  better  word — is  to  take 
off  flesh  in  spots. 

Use  all  three  methods — diet,  exercise  and 
massage.  Combine  the  three  as  I  show  you 
how  to  do  and  you  can  lose  fifteen  pounds  a 
month  and  make  your  figure  exactly  as  you 
want  it  to  be.  It  can  be  done.  I  don't  need 
to  repeat  that.  I  have  done  it  too  many 
times  to  have  any  doubts.  And,  through 
PHOTOPLAY,  I  have  shown  hundreds  upon 
hundreds  of  girls  and  women  how  to  do  it 
for  themselves. 


YOU  must  master  that  massage  to  get  the 
lumps  of  fat  off.  After  that,  you  can  keep 
them  off  by  exercise  and  diet.  In  fact,  once 
you  have  gotten  down  to  the  weight  you 
want  to  be — and,  incidentally,  those  charts 
of  proper  heights  and  weights  don't  mean  a 
tiling,  it's  simply  how  you  want  to  look  and 
how  you  feel  that  counts — you  can  include 
more  dishes  in  your  diet.  But  I'll  guaran- 
tee that  when  you've  been  on  my  diet  for  a 
little  while,  you  won't  want  to  eat  a  lot  of 
rich,  highly  seasoned  food. 

Any  lumpy,  stubborn  part  of  the  body, 


Fat  women  can  reduce 
both  upper  and  lower 
part  of  their  arms  in  this 
manner.  The  famous 
beauty  expert,  Sylvia, 
shows  you  how,  as  she 
has  told  the  film  stars 


Here's  the  correct 
position  for  your 
feet  when  you  are 
doing  the  exercise 
to  reduce  the  ankles 
that  Sylvia  describes 
in    this    article 


except  the  bust,  can  be  squeezed  off  with  your  own  two  hands- 
I  was  paid  fabulous  amounts  for  doing  that  to  the  stars.  I'm 
telling  you  that  you  can  do  it  for  yourself.  Just  take  up  hand- 
fuls  of  flesh  and  squeeze  with  all  your  might.  Then  let  the 
flesh  slip  through  your  fingers  as  if  it  were  mashed  potatoes. 
After  you  have  done  that,  spread  a  heavy  Turkish  towel  over 
the  parts  you  want  reduced  and  with  the  palms  of  your 
hands  slap  and  slap  hard. 

You  can  slap,  rub  and  squeeze  the  flesh 
away.  You  will  see  the  fat  cells  being 
smashed  off.  Don't  be  afraid  to  squeeze 
too  hard.  You  don't  want  to  be  gentle 
with  excess  fat.  I  used  to  keep  a  phono- 
graph going  all  the  time  when  I  was  treat- 
ing the  stars  in  Hollywood,  to  drown  out 
their  yells.    Honestly! 

Now  here  is  an  exercise  to  reduce  the 
hips,  and  if  you  don't  believe  that  it  will  do 
it,  measure  your  hips  before  you  start 
and  measure  them  after  doing  this  exercise 
for  fifteen  minutes  a  day  for  a  month.  Get 
down  on  your  hands  and  knees.  Stretch 
the  left  leg  far,  far  back  with  the  toe 
pointed  back.  Then  draw  the  leg  up,  with 
the  knee  at  the  chest,  but  be  sure  that  the 
toe  is  pointed  and  drags  along  the  floor  and 
be  sure  that  the  hips  rise  as  you  do  this. 
Put  the  weight  on  the  left  leg  and  repeat 
the  exercise  with  the  right  leg,  progressing 
along  the  floor.  Concentrate  on  the  hips 
and  feel  the  muscles  draw. 

NOW  here  is  the  sure  way  to  reduce  the 
bust.  Naturally,  it  will  reduce  the  en- 
tire body,  but  you  shouldn't  mind  that,  be- 
cause once  the  fat  on  the  bust  is  taken  off, 
you  can  build  up  the  rest  of  your  body, 
without  gaining  back  the  weight  in  the 
bust.  For  three  days  in  succession  do  this. 
First  thing  in  the  morning  drink  a  glass  of 
hot  or  cold  water.  Two  hours  later  drink 
six  ounces  of  buttermilk  and  two  hours 
later  take  another  six  ounces.  Do  this 
every  two  hours  until  bedtime.  During 
the  other  four  days  of  the  week  keep  up  my 
regular  general  reducing  diet,  but  eat 
sparingly  of  meat  and  go  heavy  on  fresh 
vegetables  and  fruit. 

Keep  this  up — three  days  on  the  butter- 
milk and  four  days  on  the  regular  diet 
until  your  chest  measure  is  what  you  want 
it  to  be.  This  is  a  sure  way  of  reducing  the 
bust  and  keeping  it  reduced. 

There  are  two  perfectly  grand  exercises 
for  reducing  the  stomach.  Take  your 
choice — or,  better  still,  do  them  both — one 
one  day  for  fifteen  minutes,  the  other  the

next  day.  Here's  one.  Lie 
on  the  floor,  face  down  with 
your  arms  stretched  out  flat 
on  the  floor  above  your  head. 
Now  get  a  member  of  your 
family  or  a  friend  to  grab 
you  around  the  ankles,  raise 
your  legs  high  in  the  air  and 
then  lower  them  to  the  floor. 
You  can  tell  that  this  is 
being  done  right  if  you  feel 
every  stomach  muscle  draw- 
ing and  pulling. 

Here's  the  other  exercise. 
Lie  on  your  right  side  with 
the  arms  stretched  high 
above  the  head.  Feel  your 
stomach  muscles  pulling. 
Keep  your  legs  straight  and 
stiff,  too.  Then,  without 
changing  the  position  of  the 
hands  or  legs,  roll  over  on 
your  face,  making  sure  that 
the  stomach  touches  the 
floor,  to  the  left  side.  You 
must  work  your  legs  slightly, 
keeping  them  tight  together, 
and  roll  and  hitch  yourself 
across  the  floor.  If  you  do 
this  right,  you  can  feel  the 
fat  cells  in  your  stomach 
being  smashed  off. 

THE  way  to  reduce  the 
calves  of  the  legs  is 
to  squeeze  the  flesh  off  as  I 
have  described.  But  here's 
a  way  to  reduce  the  ankles. 
Lie  flat  on  the  floor,  with  the 
toes  pointed  and  the  arms 
above  the  head  forming  a 
straight  line  from  tips  of  toes 
to  tips  of  fingers.  Now  spring 
up  and  try  to  touch  the  toes 

with  the  fingers.  You  can't  touch  the  toes,  but  that's  not  the  point. 
Don't  you  feel  a  sharp,  sudden  pain  in  the  ankles  ?  You  do — 
how  well  I  know  it.    That's  the  way  to  reduce  those  big  ankles. 

Now  for  the  arms.  Here's  a  grand  exercise.  Stand  on  tip- 
toe, arms  reaching  up  as  far  as  possible,  flat  against  a  wall. 
Then,  trying  not  to  move  your  arms  at  all — they  will,  of  course, 
move  about  half  an  inch — slowly  wiggle  yourself  downward 
with  tiny  jerks  until  your  heels  touch  the  floor.  Do  this  with- 
out any  shoes  on.  Notice  how  it  pulls  the  arms.  Ah,  that's  the 
fat  coming  off.  Start  by  doing  this  about  five  times  a  day  and 
work  up  to  twenty  times. 

Here's  a  word  of  warning.  Don't  do  the  exercises  too  often 
at  first.    Work  up  gradually  to  fifteen  or  twenty  times  on  each 


Above  and  below  Sylvia  demonstrates  how  inches  can  be 
taken  off  the  hips  in  a  few  weeks.  Hollywood  has  relied 
on  Sylvia's  "reducing"  advice  for  years.  Now  Photoplay 
readers  are  benefiting  by  it.  This  is  the  only  magazine  for 
which  she  writes.  Note  the  position  of  the  body  in  these

exercise.  And  if  you  have 
never  done  the  exercises  be- 
fore, you  should  get  your- 
self in  trim  for  them  by 
doing  something  which  I 
make  all  my  girls  do.  Don't 
laugh,  I  mean  this.  Turn 
the  radio  on  to  a  peppy  tune 
and,  with  your  arms  above 
your  head  and  your  hips 
swaying  from  side  to  side, 
dance  around  the  room 
doing  an  old-fashioned  two- 
step.  This  is  of  the  greatest 
importance.  It  prepares 
you  for  all  exercises,  but 
don't  forget  the  dancing 
even  when  you're  doing  the 
exercises.  This  little  danc- 
ing step  keeps  your  body 
lithe,  graceful  and  in  good 
condition.  It  will  reduce 
you,  too. 

SO  now  I've  shown  all  you 
new  recruits  how  to  make 
your  bodies  lovely  and  I'm 
sure  that  those  of  you  who 
have  been  following  my 
articles  so  carefully  have 
profited  by  seeing  every- 
thing set  down  here  in  such 
concise  form.  Don't  forget 
the  three  things  that  are 
essential  to  a  lovely  figure — 
diet,  exercise,  massage.  Re- 
member? All  right,  here's 
the  reducing  diet.

Want  to  reduce  your  stomach?    Here's  the  correct  way.    Starting  in  this  position,  roll  from  side  to  side,  hitching  your  body 
along  the  floor  as  you  roll.    Be  sure  the  stomach  touches  the  floor  as  you  do  this.    Thus  the  fat  cells  are  smashed  off

you  read  this  story 

By  Sara   Hamilton 


BOB  MONTGOMERY  has  six  grey  hairs  over 
each  temple  and  a  habit  of  putting  his  feet  up  on 
people's  desks  or  tables.  If  he  should  happen  to 
be  wearing  spurs,  it  makes  no  difference.  The 
feet,  spurs  and  all,  go  up  just  the  same. 

Various  executives  and  Hollywood  hostesses  are 
constantly,  and  a  bit  proudly,  pointing  out  scratched 
furniture. 

"See  that  mark?    Bob  Montgomery  did  that." 

The  grey  hairs  arrived  after  his  rise  to  stardom.  It 
practically  has  him  under — the  stardom  thing,  I  mean. 
Every  time  he  gets  ready  for  a  big  smash  hit  of  his 
own,  he  swears  something  happens.  So  he  usually 
winds  up  playing  just  another  part,  with  another  star, 
and  liking  it. 

He  will,  in  spite  of  Kingdom  Come,  hunch  his 
shoulders  in  certain  scenes.  He  goes  into  every 
picture  vowing  and  swearing  by  all  the  gods  that  this 
time  he  won't  hunch. 

In  five  minutes,  he's  hunched.  And  that  is  partly 
responsible,  along  with  his  performance  in  "Inspira- 
tion," for  the  grey  hairs. 

His  hands  are  long  and  white.  His  nails  are  spotted 
with  tiny  white  spots,  like  a  kid's. 

He's  six  feet,  one  inch  tall;  weighs  170  pounds  and 
looks  like  a  boy.  His  eyes  are  blue  and  sober.  His 
nose  apparently  at  one  time  decided  to  detour  to  the 
left,  but  missed  it  by  the  fraction  of  an  inch. 

HIS  hair  is  more  than  a  bit  curly.  And  is  usually 
artfully  tousled. 

He's  surprisingly  serious — a  bit  too  serious — and 
vaguely  unhappy. 

He's  moody.  Although  he  hides  whatever  gloom 
may  surround  him  with  a  grin,  his  friends  can  detect 
it  instantly. 

He  is,  first,  last  and  all  times,  not  the  wise-cracking, 
happy-go-lucky  Bob  Montgomery  of  the  screen.  Even 
when  he's  kidding,  one  feels  he  has  a  seriousness  of 
purpose. 

He  scribbles  all  the  time  he  talks,  printing  his  name 
in  squarish  letters,  or  drawing  pictures  that  look  like 
Jimmy  Durante's  face  with  the  mumps. 

When  he's  working,  he  gets  to  bed  at  ten-thirty. 
When  he  isn't  working  he  gets  there  at  ten-thirty  just 
the  same,  unless  he's  invited  to  a  theater  or  a  party. 
Then  he  may  never  get  there. 

He  envies  people  who  rush  about  saying,  "I  had  the 
strangest  dream  last  night."  It  seems  he  never 
dreams,  so  he  thinks  he  must  be  abnormal  and  deliber- 
ately tries  to  work  up  a  gorgeous  nightmare  every 
night.  So  far,  the  nightmare  thing  has  been  a  total 
frost. 

For  fifteen  minutes  every  morning  he  exercises  in  a 
rowing  machine.  [  please  turn  to  page  104  ] 


"Let's  travel,"  Bob  Montgomery  said  to  Madge  Evans  in 
"Lovers  Courageous."  "No,"  she  replied,  "let's  have  a 
baby."  And  as  Bob  was  playing  this  scene  before  the 
cameras  and  microphones,  his  own  baby  lay  dying.  To  have 
left  the  studio  would  have  delayed  the  company  for  days. 
That's  what's  known  in  show  business  as  real  trouping

back  in  broad,  flat  finger  waves, 
where  the  ends  are  caught  in 
myriad  curls.  The  design  of  the 
finger  wave  is  copied  in  a  lacy 
bang,  a  modish  and  softening  touch 
to  the  long,  slim  or  delicately 
moulded  face.  Naturally  curly 
hair  or  hair  susceptible  to  a  finger 
wave  is  adaptable  to  this  coiffure. 
A  marvelous  play  for  hair  lights.

THIS  charmingly  naive  departure

introduced  by  Nancy  Carroll  in 
"Hot  Saturday."  It  is  a  perfect 
answer  to  the  maiden's  prayer  for  a 
distinctive,  simple  and  new  hair  ar-

crown  of  the  head  is  brushed  in 
equal  sections  forward,  to  the  sides 
and  down  at  the  back.  The  hair  is 
then  shingled  closely  and  waved  in 
a  deep  border  circling  the  head. 
The  outer  hair  is  closely  curled  and 
permitted  to  fall  softly  about  the 
face.  The  Nancy  Carroll  type  with 
hair  inclined  to  curl  will  find  this

p\OROTHY  WILSON,  who  stepped  from 
^stenographer  to  starlet,  is  shown  recovering 
from  a  spirited  tennis  match.  Dorothy  first  mas- 
sages her  feet  gently  but  thoroughly  with  olive 
oil,  steams  them  over  boiling  water  for  five  or 
ten  minutes,  then  bathes  them  in  warm  water. 
"Grand,"  is  Dorothy's  verdict.  "I'd  never  know 
I'd  played  a  strenuous  game."  At  the  same  time 
a  rich  cream  covers  her  hands,  which  in  turn  are 
protected  by  silk  mitts,  to  guard  against  blisters. 


THERE  is  a  trick  to  applying  cream  lip 
rouge  evenly.  Betty  Furness  uses  the 
dot  method.  Three  dots  are  touched  to 
the  lips.  Your  most  convenient  finger 
then  blends  them  smoothly.  Always 
carry    the    rouge    well    inside    the    lips. 


MOLLYWOOD  adores  toilet  water  for

over  her  tendril  curls.  Her  atomizer  is

Lew 

Wants 

Another 

Ch 


Full  of  eager  curi- 
osity, Lew  Ayres  is 
as  actively  versatile 
as  a  colony  of  artists 
and  scientists.  But 
the  screen  is  his 
great  enthusiasm 


LISTEN'  to  Lew  Ayres  talking: 
"All  I  ask  now  is  an  oppor- 
tunity.    Why,  I'd  work  just 
for  coffee  and  cakes  to  have 
another  chance  half  as  good  as  the 
one  I  was  lucky  enough  to  get  in  'All 
Quiet  on  the  Western  Front.' 

"I  was  rushed  into  stardom,  per- 
haps before  I  was  read}-.     Had  anyone  predicted  three  years 
ago  that  I  would  become  a  film  star,  I  should  have  doubted 
his  sanity.     When  it  first  happened,  I  doubted  my  own." 

Lew  recently  signed  a  new  contract  with  Universal  Pictures, 
and  with  this  new  deal  has  come  a  great  change  in  the  boy 
himself. 

Out  of  the  misunderstandings  and  consequent  indifference 
toward  his  work  that  developed  after  his  sua  ess  and  swift 
decline,  out  of  the  lessons  learned  from  those  painful  experi- 
ences, there  has  developed  a  different  Lew  Ayres. 

To  this  changed  Lew,  his  career  on  the  screen  has  again 
become  tremendously  important,  important  enough  to  make 
sacrifices  for. 

You  sense  it  in  his  latest  picture,  "Okay  America!"  He  at- 
tacked his  role  of  the  columnist  with  a  zest  he  has  lacked  for  a 
long  time.  It  is  a  good  part,  and  Lew's  spirited  portrayal 
makes  it   a   vital  one. 

"It  would  be  silly,"  Lew  says,  "to  hold  the  studio  solely 
responsible  for  the  many  indifferent  pictures  in  which  I  have 
played  Too  many  other  things  have  contributed  to  the 
difficulty  of  finding  suitable  material  to  hold  any  single  indi- 
vidual or  group  at  fault.  I  must  personally  share  some  of  the 
blame. 

"I  was  intoxicated  by  the  suddenness  of  my  success.

And  that  lad  of  the 

'Western  Front"  is 

by  far  too  good  an 

actor  not  to  take  it 

By   Jack    Grant 


"Then  my  practical  side  asserted  itself.  I  was  convinced 
this  thing  couldn't  last  so  very  long,  and  when  I  learned  that  I 
was  being  loaned  to  other  studios  at  a  price  ten  times  the  salary 
I  was  receiving,  I  struck  for  more  money." 

In  no  story  about  Lew  Ayres  can  this  episode  be  passed  over 
without  special  comment.  It  was  a  period  of  misunderstand- 
ings. Lew  was  falsely  accused  of  an  increased  size  of  headgear. 
Hearing  these  accusations,  he  withdrew  even  further  into  his 
shell.  To  the  charge  of  swelled  head  was  added  that  of  sulki- 
ness. 

Lew  is  not  the  sulking  kind.  He  is  shy  and,  at  times, 
inarticulate.  He  felt  everybody  was  against  him — criticizing 
him.  He  dreaded  encounters  with  chance  acquaintances  and 
strangers.  Reporters  and  writers  called,  got  unfavorable  im- 
pressions and  went  away  to  write  harsh  items.  Those  who 
really  knew  Lew — and  they  were  pitifully  few — argued  his 
case  for  him  with  dubious  success.  Lew's  inability  to  defend 
himself  counted   heavily   against   him. 

The  salary  question  was  eventually  amicably  adjusted  and 
Lew  returned  to  work.  He  still  believed  that  his  career  would 
be  of  short  duration.  He  wanted  desperately  to  make  it  last 
as  long  as  possible.  He  attacked  his  assignments  with  en- 
thusiasm, but  the  results  were  not  particularly  good.  One 
weak  picture  followed  another. 

MOST  boys  of  twenty-three  would  have  turned  to  night 
clubs  and  gay  living  to  forget.  But  Lew  had  his  fill  of 
night  clubs  in  his  several  years  of  playing  in  dance  orchestras. 

His  weekly  pay-check  had  been  only  fifty  dollars  for  "All 
Quiet."  Now,  after  it  had  grown  to  four  figures,  there  was  no 
reason  to  throw  it  away.  So  he  held  his  peace  and  kept  his 
head  high. 

The  first  car  he  purchased  was  a  second-hand  wreck.  He 
tinkered  with  it  until  it  purred  like  a  contented  cat.  What  if 
the  top  was  torn,  the  windshield    [  please  turn"  to  page  112  ]

Mrs.  Longworth   guards  her  skin's 
freshness  with   the   same   two   creams  she   used 

and      praised     4&ltelt    2/€OA4    CW{)  This  message  from  a  brilliant  woman-one  of  the 

I  /  /  vital  figures  in  the  political  and  social  life  of 


today — who  has  continued  to  use  the  same  two 
creams  for  over  seven  years — gives  you  the  clue  to 
their  extraordinary  following  all  over  the  world. 


Mrs.  Longworth  in  192.5,  when  she  said  that  Pond's 
Creams  were  "the  foundation  to  a  clear  healthy  skin." 

Mrs.  Longworth  Today — fresher,  more  vital  looking. 
"Pond's   Two   Creams  are   all  one  needs,"  she  says. 


I  NEVER  USE  MAKE-UP  ...  I  have 
never  had  a  facial  in  my  life  .  .  .  What  I 
do  believe  in,  is  keeping  the  skin  clean  .  .  . 
oiling  it  to  keep  it  supple  .  .  .  protecting  it  rea- 
sonably from  dust  and  exposure. 

"And  Pond's  Two  Creams  do  just  those 
things.  I  use  them  because  I  know  they  are 
pure.  I  never  use  anything  on  my  face  that  I 
am  not  absolutely  sure  of." 

So  speaks  Alice  Roosevelt  Longworth, 
with  delightfully  Rooseveltian  forthrightness. 

Mrs.  Longworth  is  one  of  the  most  vivid 
personalities  in  American  life. 

Today  she  looks  fresher,  more  vital,  actually 
younger  for  her  age — than  at  any  other  period 
in  her  mature  life.  And  she  is  utterly  practical 
about  caring  for  her  skin! 


The  two  creams  she  found  years  ago  to  be 
"all  one  needs"  to  keep  her  skin  in  perfect 
condition — Pond's  Two  Creams — are  still  the 
only  creams  she  depends  on. 

"I  use  them  a  great  many  ways,"  she  says. 

.Here  are  some  of  the  special  uses  for  which 
hundreds  of  American  women  depend  upon 
Pond's  Two  Creams: — 

Pond's  Cold  Cream  . .  .  A  Grand  Cleanser. 
Gets  your  skin  both  clean  and  refreshed  at  the 
same  time.  Not  heavy,  can't  clog  the  pores. 
Not  extra-light  and  drying. 
To  Take  Away  a  Drawn  Tired  Look.  After 
cleansing  with  Pond's  Cold  Cream,  give  your 
face  a  fresh  creaming  and  let  it  stay  on  a  few 
minutes  while  you  rest.  You  both  feel  and 
look  like  new !   The  fine,  rich  oils  in  Pond's

Screen  Slar*  Knott   the  secret 
of  keeping  Youthful  Charm 


SCREEN  STARS  have  no  fear  of  birth- 
days!  They  know  the  secret   of  having 
youthful  charm  at  almost  any  age! 

"Above  everything  else  you  must  guard 
complexion  beauty,"  they  declare. 

"  I  am  30  years  old, "  says  lovely  Jetta  Goudal. 
"  There  was  a  time  when  no  woman  would  tell 
her  age,  but  nowadays  a  woman  need  not  hesi- 
tate to  admit  her  years  if  she  keeps  her  com- 
plexion '  the  eternal  18.'  I  find  Lux  Toilet  Soap 
a  great  help  in  keeping  my  complexion  young." 

The  charming  Billie  Burke,  beloved  stage 
and  screen  star,  says:  "I  really  am  40.  A  star, 
of  course,  must  keep  youthful  freshness.  For 
years  I  have  used  Lux  Toilet  Soap  regularly." 


And  young  Joyce  Compton  says:  "I'm  19. 
But  no  matter  what  my  age,  I  could  not  hope 
to  look  lovelier  than  Billie  Burke  does  right 
now.  It's  a  comfort  to  know  we  both  use  the 
same  complexion  care!  Lux  Toilet  Soap  cer- 
tainly keeps  one's  skin  youthfully  smooth 
and  clear." 

9  out  of  10  Screen  Stars  use  it 

Of  the  694  important  Hollywood  actresses,  in- 
cluding all  stars,  686  use  this  fragrant  white 
soap  regularly  to  guard  complexion  beauty. 
Therefore,  it  is  the  official  soap  of  all  the  great 
film  studios. 

Its  unrivaled  whiteness  will  delight  you — 
get  some  today.

Aline  MacMahon  smiles  in  this  tender,  human  scene  from 
"Life  Begins,"  and  she'll  keep  right  on  smiling  when  she 
reads  here   that   picture   goers    are    asking    all    about   her 


ALINE  MacMAHON  is  the  favorite  this 
month.  Hundreds  of  letters  came  in 
asking  for  information  about  her.  That 
j_'irl  is  becoming  a  regular  picture  stealer.  No 
matter  what  part  sin-  plays,  her  work  is  out- 
Standing.     Now,  here's  the  low-down: 

Aline  was  horn  in  McKeesport,  Penna.,  on 
May  3,  1899.  She  is  5  feet.  8  inches  tall; 
weighs  135  pounds  and  has  light  brown  hair 
and  blue  eyes.  After  graduating  from  Barnard 
College  in  New  York,  she  decided  on  a  stage 
career.  She  got  her  lirst  chance  by  pestering 
Edgar  Selwyn  until  he  gave  her  a  part  in  "The 
Mirage."  Other  plays  that  followed  were 
"Beyond  the  Horizon,"  "Maya,"  "Her  First 
Affair"  and  "Spread  Eagle." 

When  casting  was  going  on  for  the  Broadway 
run  of  "Once  in  a  Lifetime,"  Aline  begged  for 
the  role  of  .\Fay.  She  was  refused  it  then,  but 
later  got  the  part  when  the  c<  mpany  took  the 
play  on  its  Western  tour.  Director  Mcrvvn 
LeRov  saw  Aline  when  the  play  reached  Cali- 
fornia and  promised  her  a  chance  in  pictures. 
She  got  the  role  of  the  secretary  in  "Five  Star 
Final."  This  was  followed  by  "The  Mouth- 
I  iece."  "Week-End  Marriage,"  "Life  Begins," 
"One  Way  Passage,"  and  her  original  role  in 
"Once  in  a  Lifetime." 

Aline  is  happily  married  and  says  she  intends 
to  stay  that  way.  Her  husband.  Clarence 
Stein,  is  a  New  York  architect.  Their  careers 
keep  t he  in  apart  much  of  the  time,  hut  they 
manage  to  slip  away  together  for  several 
months  each  year. 

Although  Aline  played  the  part  of  a  secre- 
tary in  two  of  her  pictures,  she  has  never  bet  n 
one  in  rial  life.  Hundreds  of  stenographers 
and  secretaries,  after  seeing  her  on  the  screen. 
have  written  to  her  asking  her  advice  t:n  '"  how 
to  handle  the  bo 

Her  chief  hobbies  are  collecting  eld  jewelry 
and  English  china.  She  is  passionately  fond  of 
reading  letters,  anybody's  letters,  lows  HolL  - 
wood  and  picture  work.  She  is  under  conlrai  t 
to  Warners.

Bob,  Washington,  D.  C. — The  lour  Mad 
Marxes  were  all  born  in  New  York  City.  Chico, 
who  plays  the  piano,  was  born  on  March  22, 
1801.  Harpo,  the  red-wigged  silent  one  was 
born  on  November  21,  189.->.  Groucho,  with

the  swords  and  pistols  and  stop  the  fighting. 
Ycu  each  win  half  the  argument,  because 
Loretta  Young  has  light  brown  hair.  How- 
ever, in  her  latest  picture  "Life  Begins,"  she 
does  wear  a  blonde  wig.  Adrienne  Ames  hails 
from  Lort  Worth,  Texas.

All  Colors . . . 


the  tint  of  the  nails  depends  on  the  gown, 
says  world  manicure  authority 


IF  you're  lucky  enougli  to  sit  in 
on  an  "opening"  in  Paris,  you'll 
see  the  grand  mannequins  go  glid- 
ing by  not  only  in  bewilderingly 
lovely  gowns,  but  in  a  most  alluring 
variety  of  Nail  Tints. 

No  "Big  House"  goes  colorless. 
And  many  of  them  sanction  3  or  4 
shades  for  their  mannequins. 

These  Elegant  Girls  have  been 
tinting  their  nails  for  years.  And  it's 
time  Everyone  over  here  discovered 
how  nicely  the  Right  Nail  Tint  com- 
pletes the  costume. 

You'll  find  that  Rose  nails  cliok 
like  anything  with  black  or  dark 
green  street  costumes.  And  Garnet 
nails,  worn  with  the  new  tawny 
shades,  go  to  the  head  like  wine! 

If  you  run  out  of  original  color 

schemes,  you  can  rely  on  the  panel 

Nortiiam  Warren, 


Natural  just  slightly  emphasizes  the 
natural  pink  of  your  nails.  Goes  with  all 
costumes — is  best  with  bright  colors — red, 
blue,  green,  purple,  orange,  yellow. 

Rose  Is  a  lovely  feminine  shade,  good  with 
any  dress,  pale  or  vivid.  Charming  with 
pastel  pink,  blue,  lavender,  dark  green, 
black  and  brown. 

Coral  is  enchanting  with  white,  pale 
pink,  beige,  gray,  "the  blues."  black,  dark 
brown.  Smart  also  with  deeper  colors 
(except  red)  if  not  too  Intense. 


Cardinal  is  deep  and  exotic.  It  contrasts 
excitingly  with  black,  white,  or  pale  shades 
,  .  .  is  a  good  shade  with  gray,  beige,  the  new 
blue.  Wear  Cardinal  in  your  festive  moods! 

Garnet,  a  rich  wine   red.  just  right  with 
frocks  in  the  new  tawny  shades,  cinnamon 
brown,  black,  white,  beige,  pearl  gray  or 
burnt  orange. 

Colorless  is  conservatively  correct  at  any 
time.  You'll  be  sure  to  want  it  for  very 
bright  or  "difficult"  colors!

"D  OWII  COl. MAX  is  "getting  away  from 
-*-*-it  all" — again.  In  Hollywood  it  is  known 
pulling  a  Garbo 

Ronnie  has  never  liked  Hollywood  and  Hol- 
lywood's  social  activities,  so  he  has  just  bought 
:l  hundred  acres  with  a  half  mile  beach 
front  on  California's  coast  line.  So  remote  is 
his  place  that  Ronnie  will  have  to  build  his 
o\\  n  road  to  the  estate. 

I  he  country  about  is  full  of  game,  with 
plenty  of  quail,  wild  cat-,  deer,  mountain  lions 
and  what  not.  There  is  a  bay  on  his  beach 
suitable  for  yacht  mooring,  and  deep  sea  fishing 
will  be  one  of  our  handsome  hermit's  diversions. 

rT'HF  state  of  Hollywood's  heart  is  like  this: 
Madge  Evans  will  marry  Tom  Gallery  as 
soon  as  his  and  ZaSu  Pitts'  divorce  is  final. 

But  there's  trouble  brewing  between  Greta 
Nissen  and  her  handsome  husband,  Weldon 
Heyburn. 

Polan  Banks  is  courting  Lila  Lee  every  Wed- 
nesday and  Sunday  night. 


But  Don  Cook  and  Evalyn  Knapp  aren't 
seeing  each  other  so  often. 

Then  there's  that  miniature  romance  be- 
tween Jack  Oakie  and  Joyce  Compton.  They 
go  Austin  riding. 

Maureen  O'Sullivan's  heavy  flame  is  a  San 
Francisco  lad,  Dick  Seymore.  And  Jimmie 
Dunn  is  disconsolate. 

Ann  Harding  goes  to  The  Frolics  with  Eddie 
Cronjager.  her  cameraman. 

And  the  little  birds  tell  you  that  the  romance 
between  Ginger  Rogers  and  Mervyn  LeRoy  is 
cooling  off. 

Lew  Cody  and  Dorothy  Ates  go  fox-trotting 
together. 

Joan  Blondell  won't  admit  that  she  is  mar- 
ried to  George  Barnes. 

Lili  Damita  and  Sidney  Smith  have  quar- 
reled.   Again ! 

When  Norma  Shearer's  brother,  Douglas, 
got  married,  even  Norma  was  surprised. 

After  a  whole  month  David  Manners  and 
Billie  Dove  are  still  that  way. 


Jack  Gilbert  gave  Virginia  Bruce  a  grand 
piano  for  a  wedding  present. 

Rudy  Vallee  and  Fay  Webb  quarreled.  She 
went  to  Reno.    Then  they  made  up. 

"NJEIL  HAMILTON  was  his  father's  best 
man  when  dad  got  married  recently. 

Johnny  Weissmuller  and  Bobbe  Arnst  are 
talking  over  divorce  plans. 

Lyle  Talbot  and  Eddie  Burns  argue  over 
Estelle  Taylor's  free  evenings.  But  Jack  Demp- 
sey  calls  up  at  least  once  a  week. 

AND 

Richard  Dix  is  so  excited  over  the  fact  that 
he  is  going  to  be  Daddy  Dix  pretty  soon  that 
he  is  already  passing  out  cigars. 

/"^  FORGE  RAFT  and  Constance  Cummings

A  beautiful  girl  and  her  grandmother?  Don't  you  believe  it.  They're  both 
Ann  Harding.  It's  one  of  those  skilful  make-up  jobs  by  Ern  Westmore. 
Ann  goes  from  youth  to  old  age  in  her  new  film,  "The  Conquerors" 


"PRIENDSHTP  alter  divorce."     That-*  the 

title  of  this  story.  Hollywood  has 
sipe  I  much  about  Miriam  Hopkins  and  writer 
husband  Austin  1'arker.  If  they  are  divorced. 
why  are  they  constantly  together?  Are  they 
really  divorced  or  merely  living  in  separate 
houses?    Those  are  the  questions  being  asked. 

Immediately  before  leaving  for  New  York, 
Miriam  said  she  hadn't  had  time  to  get  a  di- 
vorce. She'd  been  too  busy  Hut  when  she 
stopped  over  in  Chicago  and  adopted  "Mi- 
chael,'' the  onc-monlh-old  baby,  she  said  she 
was  single. 

Frankly.  Hollywood  didn't  believe  that  state- 
ment. 

Hut  Hollywood  is  not  trained  to  believe  what 
i-  done  quietly,  unostentatiously,  without  pub- 
licity or  excitement.  When  Miriam  was  said 
to  be  too  l>ii<\,  the  divorce  had  already  been 
granted! 

"It  w  as  a  mail-order  one  secured  in  Mexico. '' 
Mr.  Parker  explains.  "It  was  granted  early 
in  March.  " 

"K  A K.  PARKER  spent  some  time  in  Mexico 
immediately  after  that  divorce.  He  left 
hurriedly  for  New  York.  On  tin  day  of  his 
an  ival.  lie  met  a  friend. 

"How's  Mrs    Parker?"  the  friend  inquired. 

"Very  well,  indeed.  " 

"I   haven't   seen  her  for  several  days,"   the 

!  continued. 
e\  husband's  eyes  brightened.    "What 
do  you  mean,  srw  ral  </ I  \ 

It  was  a  delicate  situation.  Mr.  Parker  had 
not  known  Mrs  Parker  was  in  New  York. 
His  friend  didn't  know  of  the  divorce.  Mr. 
Parker  managed  to  Mtun  the  name  of  Mr-. 
Parker's  hotel  without  arousing  too  mud 
I 

He  telephoned  her.     She  thought  he  was 


calling  from  Mexico  City.  When  she  found 
he  was  at  a  certain  hotel  in  New  York  City, 
she  said.  "Hut  that  hotel  isn't  as  nice  as  mine. 
Why  don't  you  move  over?" 

He  moved.  They  had  dinner.  They  talked 
it  over. 

And  they  reached  a  decision  which  all  ex- 
husbands  and  ex-wives  should  consider:  Why 
not  be  friends,  even  though  divorced? 


Hollywood  is  pretty  confused,  and  host 
don't  know  whether  the  two  should  be  invited 
to  the  same  parties  or  not,  yet  they  an   -ten 
together  at   polo  games,  tennis  matchi  - 
theater  openings.    Just  another  of  Holly., 
social  problems! 

X/TAKIAN  NIXON  and  Eddie  Hillman  have 
separated — again.     It's  not  the  first  time 
So  no  one  can  be  certain  that  it's  the  la-' 
even  Marian  and  Eddie. 

Eddie  told  his  troubles  to  Ethel  Harrymor^ 
an  intimate  friend  of  his,  when  he  and  Marian 
quarreled.  Marian  says  she  is  f:oin«  to  sell  the 
Beverly  Hills  mansion  which  Eddie  furnished 
for  her.

"D '  >Y,  oh  boy,  you  should  have  seen  Irene 
*^Dunne  with  that  first  class,  A-l  mad  on. 
And  honestly  you  can't  blame  her. 

Mitt  -he  had  been  promised  a  month's 
vacation,  her  husband  came  from  New  York 
to  spend  the  time  in  Honolulu  with  her.  When 
they  arrived  at  Hawaii  there  were  three  radio- 
gram- from  the  studio  telling  her  to  return  im- 
mediately to  play  the  lead  opposite  Leslie  How- 
ard in  "Animal  Kingdom." 

Without  even  unpacking  their  bags,  they 
took  a  boat  back  and  rushed  to  the  studio 
straight  from  the  docks,  only  to  discover — I 
can  hardly  go  on — that  in  the  meantime  some- 
body had  changed  his  mind  and  Ann  Harding 
was  to  play  in  the  picture  instead! 

"VTiT  Irene  Dunne  was  pleased  that  she  did 
not  have  to  play  the  lead  in  "Animal  King- 
dom. "  She  was  glad  to  get  out  of  the  part 
because  she  felt  it  was  a  man's  picture.  Leslie 
Howard  was  bound  to  get  all  the  breaks! 

And  now  Ann  Harding  is  playing  the  role 
which  Irene  didn't  want. 

T  OTS  of  folks  in  Hollywood  will  tell  you  that 

grand  little  trouper.  Eric  Linden,  is  ritzy, 

up-stage  and  high-hat.    The  truth  of  the  mat- 


ter is  that  the  kid  is  as  sensitive  as  a  violin 
string  and  his  nerves  are  pulled  just  as  taut. 
Between  scenes  he  simply  cannot  chat  with 
his  fellow  actors. 

And  he  has  never  been  able  to  eat  a  full 
meal  at  lunch  time.  Instead,  he  has  a  glass  of 
buttermilk  in  his  dressing-room. 

TT'S  a  nice  little  story — the  reason  why  George 
Arliss  begged  to  stay  in  England  just  as  long 
as  he  could. 

He  wanted  to  be  near  his  little  garden,  which 
is  the  lo\-eliest  in  all  England. 

And  it's  fun  to  contemplate  the  grandest 
actor  keeping  up  the  garden  himself. 

HP  HE  same  old  argument  was  on, 
"*"  about   whether   the    director  or 
actor  is  more  important  to  the  pic- 
ture. 

"Well,  anyway,"  a  well-known  ac- 
tor growled,  "  'Strange  Interlude' 
was  the  only  picture  that  gave  an 
actor  credit  for  thinking." 

AND  still  they  come — stories  about  the  mak- 
ing  of  "Grand  Hotel."    Here's  a  good  yam 
that  we  just  heard. 


Jack  Barrymore  and  Greta  Garbo  had  never 
met  and  the  first  day  Jack  arrived  on  the  set 
with  a  large  chip  on  his  shoulder.  Rumors  of 
Garbo  temperament  had  already  come  to  him. 
He  would  show  her  that  no  Swedish  upstart 
could  put  one  over  on  a  Barrymore.  He  ar- 
rived on  the  set  fifteen  minutes  early  to  be 
prepared  for  her  entrance. 

Nine  o'clock  arrived.  No  Garbo.  Nine- 
fifteen  came. 

Still  no  Garbo.  Just  as  he  expected.  She 
was  putting  on  an  act,  keeping  a  Barrymore 
waiting. 

Just  then  a  prop  boy  ran  up  to  him.  "I 
didn't  know  you  were  here,  Mr.  Barrymore," 
the  lad  said.  "Miss  Garbo  has  been  waiting 
outside  the  door  since  nine  o'clock  to  escort 
you  onto  the  set.  It  was  an  honor  she  wanted 
to  pay  you. " 

Garbo  followed  the  prop  boy. 

"This  is  a  great  day  for  me,"  she  said.  "How 
I  have  looked  forward  to  working  with  John 
Barrymore. " 

The  chip  fell  right  off  Jack's  shoulder  with 
a  dull  sickening  thud.  And  that's  why  there 
was  not  even  any  attempted  scene  stealing  be- 
tween Greta  and  Jack.

Speak 


in  behalf  of 

The  Retail  Druggist? 


Your  druggist  occupies  an  intimate  relationship  with 
you.    He  brings  to  it  a  sense  of  high  responsibility. 

Most  druggists  are  educated,  intelligent  and  con- 
scientious. 

We  don't  pretend,  naturally,  that  every  druggist  ev- 
erywhere is  a  paragon  of  perfection;  but  generally 
speaking,  the  druggist  adds  on  to  a  commercial  com- 
petence a  professional  point  of  view. 


Photoplay  has  recently  published  an  advertisement 
about  a  growing  practice  on  the  part  of  some  mer- 
chants of  substituting  unknown  or  inferior  products. 

A  few  of  our  readers,  and  a  number  of  retail  druggists, 
have  unfortunately  misunderstood  and  misconstrued 
our  intention  in  publishing  this  advertisement.  We 
know  that  a  relatively  small  number  of  druggists  are 
guilty  of  the  practice. 


Insofar  as  any  of  our  readers,  or  any  of  our  friends  in 
the  druggist  trade  have  felt  this  advertisement  to  be 
a  disparagement  of  the  standards  of  the  druggists 
fraternity,  we  want  to  take  this  opportunity  to  dis- 
claim any  such  purpose  in  its  publication. 

Photoplay  values  highly  the  respect  and  the  good 
will  of  the  retail  druggist,  and  the  high  standards  of

Esther  Ralston  once  said  that  she  would  be  the  happiest  woman  in  the 
world  if  ever  she  had  a  beautiful  baby  girl.  And  now  that  little  Mary 
is  a  year  old,  mama  continues  to  grow  more  radiant  by  the  minute.  Esther 
goes  right  on  making  personal  appearances  and  takes  Mary  with  her 


est!  .  .  .  Tom  Mix  is  going  around  the  world 
— with  his  wife,  a  troupe  of  cowboys  and  his 
faithful  horse,  Tony — just  as  soon  as  his  new 
picture  is  finished.  .  .  .  There  is  a  real  Mickey 
Mouse.  His  name  is  Michael  Mouse  and  he  is 
an  English  barrister.  .  .  .  Ordinary  paint  is 
never  used  on  movie  sets.  Paint  is  almost  a 
solid  and  retlects  sound  waves,  causing  faint 
echoes.  They  use  porous  paint  instead.  .  .  . 
The  gown  Ethel  Barrymore  wears  in  "Ras-

by  the  Czarina  and  weighs  twenty-five  pounds. 
No  wonder  Ethel  looks  exhausted  after  every 
scene.  .  .  .  Those  cobwebs  you  see  in  old 
houses  in  the  movies  are  merely  asbestos 
shredded  very  fine.  .  .  .  Through  her  agent, 
Garbo  has  bought  the  beautiful  summer  home 
of  Ivar  Kreuger,  near  Stockholm.  .  .  .  Gary 
Cooper's  chimpanzee  actually  gets  fan  mail 
and  gifts  from  all  parts  of  the  world.  .  .  .  The

folks  discovered  that  Ann  Harding  was  disguis- 
ing herself  on  the  street  by  wearing  a  black  wig, 
Ann  had  a  red  one  made.  And  now  we've  gone 
and  told  the  secret.  .  .  .  By  a  special  dispensa- 
tion of  the  famous  California  Tuna  Fishing 
Club,  Jack  Barrymore's  baby  son  has  been 
made  a  member.  ...  To  avoid  paying  so 
much  income  tax  the  high  salaried  stars  are

Bebe  Daniels  is  now  making  her  262nd  picture. 

"CADDIE  CANTOR  was  helping 
"^direct  a  miniature  stage  pro- 
duction of  "Whoopee,"  when  an 
actor  demanded  one  hundred  dollars 
to  play  an  Indian. 

Eddie  hurriedly  called  thepro- 
ducer  aside  and  whispered,  "Listen, 
offer  him  fifty  dollars  and  make  it 
a  half-breed." 


TT  71 1  I.N'  the  huge  studio  of  Metro-Goldwyn- 
Mayer  was  just  a  ranch  out  in  the  coun- 
try, some  one  planted  two  fig  trees,  that  now 
bear  fruit,  just  within  the  studio  gates.  A  sign 
was  hung  on  the  trees  warning  every  passerby 
to  refrain  from  eating  the  fruit. 

But  when  Greta  Garbo  first  came  onto  the 
lot  she  spied  the  tigs  and  ignoring  the  sign 
(maybe  she  no  read  English  yet)  helped  herself 
to  the  figs.  And  the  studio  promptly  sent  out 
photographers  to  snap  Greta  plucking  the  lus- 
cious fruit. 

And  now  it's  a  scramble  every  morning  to 
see  who  gels  in  first  to  pluck  the  ripest  tigs 
from  the  old  M-G  M  tig  trees. 

A  ND  there's  that  snappy  come- 
back of  Corey  Ford's,  the

"I'm  not  doing  so  well  in  this  pic-

remarked.  "I  think  I  ought  to  change

^-'Broadway.  His  Paramount  picture,  "The 
Phantom  President,"  completed,  he  lost  no 
time  in  shaking  the  Hollywood  dust  from  his 
shoes.  "If  I  stay  in  Hollywood,"  a  friend 
quotes  him,  "I  fear  for  my  sense  of  humor. 
Maybe  I'll  laugh  about  what  has  happened  to 
me  when  I  go  home.    But  I  can't  laugh  here." 

A  HOLLYWOOD  stable  owner  fell  in  a 
swoon  when  Joel  McCrea  ordered  a  pony 
— but  not  a  polo  pony,  just  a  good  old  pack 
animal.  You  see,  Joel  has  joined  the  back  to 
nature  movement,  but  it's  a  one  man  organiza- 
tion. All  by  himself,  Joel — and  pony — tramp 
around  the  high  mountains,  pitching  a  tent 
whenever  he  feels  tired.  Those  Hollywood 
girls  who  demand  all  of  the  lad's  time  forced 
him  into  retreat. 

"pVER  since  Kay  Francis  took  that  dis- 
astrous trip  to  the  "A  Farewell  To  Arms" 
set,  Director  Ernst  Lubitsch  has  forbidden  a 
single  member  of  his  troupe  to  leave  his  stage. 
Seems  that  Kay  happened  to  wander  over 
to  watch  Helen  Hayes  at  work  and  got  there 
just  in  time  for  the  big  death  scene.  Kay 
began  to  cry  and  couldn't  stop.  It  took  her 
thirty  minutes  to  control  her  sobs  and  an 
hour  and  a  half  to  repair  the  make-up  she 
had  damaged.  What's  more,  she  wasn't  fit  to 
work  the  rest  of  the  day.  And  that's  how  come 
the  new  Lubitsch  ruling. 

"DELIEVE  it  or  not,  a  certain 
■*■"■ star  walked  into  a  swanky  book 
shop  in  Hollywood  and  asked  for 
four  feet  and  eight  inches  of  books. 
She  had  measured  her  empty  shelves. 

•"THE  secret  is  out.  We  know  now  where 
these  Marx  brothers  get  all  their  wit.  It 
seems  the  boys'  father  wanted  to  go  to  New 
York. 

"Why  do  you  want  to  go  to  New  York  for?" 
Groucho  asked  him. 

"I'm  lonesome  for  you  boys,"  he  replied. 

"Why,  we're  all  here  in  Hollywood,"  the 
surprised  Groucho  said. 

"I  know,  but  I'll  go  there  and  wait  for  you." 

T)  OY  DEL  RUTH,  the  director,  will  have  his 
jokes.  Out  at  the  First  National  com- 
missary the  other  day  he  tossed  a  coin  to  the 
floor  and  covering  it  with  his  foot  said  aloud, 
"Did  any  one  here  lose  a  five-dollar  gold 
piece?"  Four  writers  spoke  up  at  once,  "I  did." 
"Well,  here's  a  dime  of  it,"  the  director  said 
picking  up  the  dime.  "Let's  all  get  down  and 
hunt  for  the  $4.90." 

PREDRIC  MARCH  and  his  wife,  Florence 
Eldridge,  gave  the  most  sensational  Holly- 
wood party  of  this  or  any  other  month.  In- 
stead of  the  usual  masquerade  affair,  they 
demanded  that  each  guest  arrive  in  a  "gay 
nineties"  costume.  And  when  the  boys  and 
girls  were  assembled,  they  found  the  March 
home  had  been  completely  redecorated  with 
horse  hair  sofas,  post  card  racks  and  what-nots 
to  conform  to  the  period. 

Mary  Pickford  arrived  on  a  high-wheeled 
bicycle.  Helen  Hayes  and  Fay  Wray  were 
burlesque  queens  in  high  buttoned  shoes  and 
white  tights.  Norma  Shearer  leaned  to  feather 
boas  and  plumes.  But  young  producer  David 
Selznick  made  the  hit  of  the  evening  as  Teddy 
Roosevelt.  He  had  a  set  of  teeth  especially 
made  for  the  occasion.  Well,  there  was  more 
fun  and,  incidentally,  it's  a  good  idea.  Try 
it  in  your  home-town  sometime.

Thank  you  for  your  new  low  prices 
.  .  .  We  simply  couldn't  keep  house 
without  you!" 

And  from  Washington,  D.  C, 
Mrs.  Henry  R.  Duryee,  Jr.,  writes: 
"Before  Ivory  Soap  was  reduced, 
I  used  it  only  for  toilet  purposes, 
but  now  I  use  it  for  all  household 
uses  and  am  able  to  cut  down  ex- 
penses." 

So  it  goes   all  over  America. 
Letter  after  letter  says — in  effect 
— "Once  I  used  Ivory,  because 


of  its  precious  purity,  only  for  the 
things  I  valued  most.  Now  Ivory 
prices  are  so  low  that  I  can  use  it 
for  everything — and  keep  my  hands

another  one  of  those  chocolate  creams  instead. 

At  any  rate  the  set  was  all  arranged  and 
Horis,  wearing  copper  plated  shoes  as  an  as- 
surance that  tin-  holt  would  pass  immediately 
through  his  body,  stood  waiting  for  the  word

Suddenly  an  electrician  rushed  forward. 
''Open  your  mouth,"   he  yelled. 

Boris  opened  wide  and  said.  "Ah." 

"Okay,  let  her  go,"  the  electrician  called. 

It  seems  that  somebody  had  just  re-

have  been  drawn  right  to  his  head — and,  land

A  ND  here's  the  best  yet.  A  well-dressed 
man  with  spats  and  cane  strolled  into  the 
exclusive  executive's  private  dining-room  at 
M-G-M  and  sat  down  at  the  table,  asking  for 
a  sandwich.  Several  writers  and  producers, 
thinking  him  some  important  guest  of  Irving 
Thalberg  or  Louis  Mayer,  raced  to  the  kitchen 
for  the  sandwich.  An  order  for  a  cup  of  coffee 
came  next  and  this  time,  impressed  by  the 
stranger's  nonchalance,  everyone  raced  to  the 
kitchen  for  the  coffee.  He  ate  in  silence  and 
then,  looking  up,  demanded  to  know  how  much 
he  owed  them.  It  was  an  extra  who  thought 
he  was  in  the  studio  commissary. 
Can  you  see  the  look  on  their  faces ! 

"DOOR  Jimmy  Durante.    He  was 
going   about  looking  very  glum 
the  other  day  when  someone  stopped 
and  asked  the  cause  of  his  woe. 

"Well,  you  see,  pardner,  it's  this 
way,"  Jimmy  explained,  "I  bumped 
my  nose  on  the  set  yesterday  and 
I'm  sore  all  over.    Haaaaaa." 

"DERHAPS  you  remember  Mozelle  Brittone, 
who,  some  three  years  ago,  was  hailed  by 
Fox  Studio  as  the  discovery  of  the  day.  But 
Mozelle  never  worked  before  a  camera.  Shortly 
after  she  arrived  in  Hollywood,  she  was  stricken 
by  an  ailment  that  sent  her  weight  soaring  to- 
ward the  two  hundred  mark.  Her  contract 
with  Fox  was  cancelled. 

A  few  days  back,  I  saw  a  pretty  young  lady 
working  in  the  script  department  at  Columbia. 
You've  guessed  it — Mozelle  completely  recov- 
ered from  her  illness.  She  weighs  less  than  a 
hundred  now  and  Harry  Cohn  has  promised 
her  a  chance  on  the  screen  the  first  time  a 
really  good  part  comes  along. 

TT  couldn't  be  a  Cecil  De  Mille  picture  with- 
out someone  taking  a  bath  or  two.  So  one 
hot  day  in  August  two  tired  workmen  filled  a 
huge  Roman  bath  with  milk  on  "The  Sign  of 
the  Cross"  set.  At  last  it  was  ready.  The 
lights  were  adjusted  and  the  cameras  in  place. 
Elissa  Landi  was  just  about  to  step  into  the 
milk  bath  when  there  was  a  wild  cry  from  an 
assistant  director.  The  milk  had  curdled.  And 
a  Roman  lady  almost  submerged  herself  in 
near  cottage  cheese.  So  the  bath  had  to  be 
emptied  and  the  work  of  refilling  began  again. 

"\X7HEN    Mary    Boland    arrived 

in     Hollywood     she     was 

rushed  immediately  to  the  Paramount 

studios  and  handed  a  script  to  study. 

She  went  straight  home  and  stayed 
up  half  the  night  reading  the  story 
and  learning  her  lines.  The  next 
morning  the  studio  telephoned  her, 
"We're  terribly  sorry,  Miss  Boland, 
we've  made  a  mistake.  That  was 
Mae  West's  script  we  gave  you." 

And  that,  gentle  reader,  is  why 
Hollywood  stars  go  mad. 

"  A  CHANEY  will  never  use  a  double. " 

Lon  Chaney  once  said  those  words  and 
now  his  son  Creighton  repeats  them. 

Playing  his  first  important  role  at  Radio  Pic-

Film  on  teeth  is  dangerous 

Look  at  film  under  the  microscope 


Queer  germs  live  on  your  teeth. 
Science  links  them  to  tooth  decay, 
gum  disorders  and  many  other 
troubles.  Germs  are  glued  to 
teeth  by  an  ever-forming  film. 


w\ 


This  is  what  the  scientist  finds 
when  he  analyzes  film  on  teeth 

I  A  species  of  Lactobacilli  now  held 
responsible  for  tooth  decay  by  many 
scientists. 
y  A  species  of  Streptococcus  Pyogenes  that 
™  gets  into  the  blood  through  the  tis- 
.    sues  and  causes  serious  infection. 


YOU  don't  need  a 
microscope  to  pick 
out  film-stained  teeth. 
The  naked  eye  can't  miss 
them  for  film  is  ugly  and 
disgusting. 

But  where  the  naked  eye  sees  ugliness  the 
microscope  sees  danger.  Magnify  film  1000 
times  and  you  will  see  living  germs  of  many 
kinds.  Look  especially  at  those  rod-shaped 
ones  in  pairs  and  groups— Lactobacilli  is  their 
scientific  Latin  name. 

Destroyers  of  lovely  teeth 

Lactobacilli  are  the  "germs  of  tooth  decay." 
They  feed  on  the  particles  of  food  that  cling 
to  teeth.  They  give  off  lactic  acid  that  dissolves 
the  tooth  enamel,  then  devours  the  part  be- 
neath. Finally  the  nerve  is  reached  causing 
abscesses  and  infection. 

Lactobacilli  appear  in  countless  numbers. 
In  fact,  the  film  scraped  from  a  single  tooth 
may  easily  contain  millions  of  living  organ- 
isms. The. only  way  science  accepts  of 
removing  germs  from  teeth  is  to  remove  the 
protective  film-coat  in  which  they  live  and 
multiply.  Film  clings  stubbornly.  It  defies  all 
ordinary  ways  of  brushing.  That's  why 
Pepsodent  laboratories  have  always  centered 
their  attention  on  the  film-removing  proper- 
ties of  their  toothpaste. 

A  new  discovery 

Now  these  scientific  laboratories  have  devel- 
oped a  new  and  revolutionary  material  for 
removing  ugly  film  and  polishing  teeth. 


It  is  radically  different  from  any  found  in 
other  toothpastes,  different  in  composi- 
tion and  in  action. 
Some  toothpastes  remove  film  with  mate- 
rials so  hard  that  they  scratch  enamel.  But  the 
new  material  in  Pepsodent  is  soft— twice  as 
soft  as  the  material  commonly  used  in  den- 
tifrices. What's  more,  this  new  discovery 
shows  extraordinary  power  in  removing 
stubborn  film  and  giving  brilliant  polish. 

This  new  cleansing  and  polishing  material 
is  contained  in  Pepsodent  exclusively.  It  sets  a 
new  standard  in  effectiveness  and  in  safety.

Oh,  you  can't  beat  these  new  commonsense 
blondes  in  Hollywood. 

TPHEY  know  at  which  end  of  the  rainbow 
■*■  that  pot  of  gold  lies. 

And  they're  going  out  after  it. 

Or  else  why  docs  Karen  Morley  wave  gaily 
to  every  newspaper  and  magazine  writer  in  the

cither. 

I-  Karen  so  passionately  fond  of  writers? 
Well,  well. 

Why  does  Carole  Lombard  smile  that  little 
side  wheeler  smile  of  hers  as  she  tucks  hers  and 
Willie  Powell's  roll  carefully  away  while  Holly-

And  the  new  ones  have  it,  too. 

Even  worse. 

For  instance,  why  did  Joan  Blondell  hand 
back  that  stardom  Warner  Bros,  handed  her 
on  a  silver  platter  after  her  first  hit  or  two  and 
say: 

"\"o,  thank  you.  Not  yet.  I'd  rather  wait 
until  the  fans  handed  me  that  particular  dish. 
And  I'll  wait  until  I  see  that  they  do"? 

Why  is  that  big,  blue-eyed  doll  baby,  Bette 
Davis,  listened  to  with  respect  by  even,'  in-

Tempe  ra  men  t  ?     Never. 

Common  sense  is  the  answer. 

Good,  clear  thinking.

Oh,  what  would  be  the  fate,  kind  sir,  of  the 
Mae  Murrays,  the  Lillian  Gishes,  the  Mary 
Miles  Minters,  the  Mildred  Harrises  in  Holly-

Where  quick  thinking,  outguessing  and  good

"CLUTTERING  hands,  graceful  hysterics  on

Yes,  the  day  of  the  "dizzy  blonde"  is  over.

For  the  past  fifteen  years  I  have 
been  caring  for  an  invalid  sister  who 
has  an  incurable  disease.  Because  of 
her  condition  I  have  been  unable  to 
do  most  of  the  things  that  life  usually 
provides  for  happiness.  My  one  rec- 
reation is  the  movies. 

Once  a  week  I  enter  into  the  land  of 
beauty  and  adventure  for  which  I 
long,  and  my  heartfelt  thanks  go  out 
to  the  actors,  actresses  and  producers 
who  make  this  romance  possible  for

IT'S  not  wise  to  chide  a  modern  girl 
about  her  cooking  ability!  Several 
young  men  about  Hollywood  dis- 
covered that  when  they  bet  Mary 
Mason,  Phyllis  Fraser  and  Dorothy 
Wilson,  that  they  couldn't  plan  and 
cook  an  old-fashioned  Thanksgiving 
dinner.      Mary,    Phyllis   and    Dorothy 

not  only  took  up  the  wager — but  sent  the  bills  for  the  groceries 
to   the   disbelieving  young   men!      The   menu    was   carefully- 
planned  from  soup  to  nuts.    Here  it  is: 
Seafood  Cocktail 
Cream  of  Mushroom  Soup 

Celery  Cranberry  Jelly 

Roast  Stuffed  Turkey 
Chestnut  Sauce 

Glace  Sweet  Potatoes 

Pumpkin  Tarts 
Demi-Tasse 

The  decorations  for  the  table  were  unusually  charming,  as 
planned.  The  table  was  to  be  decorated  in  red  and  white. 
The  cloth  was  to  be  white  damask,  the  glassware  red  and  the 
dishes  white  with  a  red  fruit  pattern.  The  centerpiece  was 
to  be  fruit  on  a  white  dish,  the  whole  resting  on  red  autumn 
leaves.  White  candlesticks 
and  red  candles  as  a  finishing 
touch. 

Each  one  of  the  three  had 
some  particular  recipe  but  all 
three  agreed  on  the  formula  for 
the  best  turkey  dressing. 

Turkey  Dressing  —  For  this 
savory  stuffing  you  will  need  the 
following  ingredients:  1  quart 
of  stale  bread  cut  in  pieces,  1 
teaspoon  salt,  lA  teaspoon  pep- 
per, 2  tablespoons  fat  drippings, 
melted;  heart,  liver  and  gizzard 
or  pork  sausage;  %  teaspoon 
ginger,  34  teaspoon  poultry 
seasoning,  1  teaspoon  chopped 
parsley,  1  egg  and  Yi  teaspoon 
of  onion,  chopped  fine. 


This  smiling  trio,  Mary  Mason,  Dorothy 
Wilson  and  Phyllis  Fraser,  are  busy 
winning  a  bet!  Someone  said  modern 
girls  couldn't  plan  a  real  old-fashioned 
Thanksgiving  dinner  like  mother  did. 
Read  their  answer  below — and  too 
many    cooks    didn't   spoil   this   dinner!

You  may  send  either  stamps  or  coin. 


Soak  the  bread  in  cold  water  and 
squeeze  dry.  Season  to  taste  and  add 
the  melted  fat.  Mix  thoroughly,  adding 
the  egg  slightly  beaten,  and  the  onion. 
Add  the  heart,  liver  and  tenderest  part 
of  the  gizzard,  chopped  fine  and  partially 
boiled.  If  you  are  using  the  sausage, 
add  it  instead.  This  is  stuffed  into  the 
turkey  and  the  opening  sewed  up. 

Mary  Mason  had  a  favorite  chestnut  sauce.  Here  it  is: 
Chestnut  Sauce — Boil  two  cups  of  chestnuts  in  salted  water, 
blanch  and  peel  then  mash  fine.  To  this  add  turkey  gravy 
which  has  been  prepared  from  the  fat  in  the  roasting  pan  by 
adding  four  tablespoons  of  flour  to  four  of  the  fat.  Stir  the 
gravy  to  a  paste  then  add  one  pint  of  broth  which  has  been 
made  by  simmering  the  neck,  wing  tips  and  giblets  in  a  quart 
of  water.     When  stirred  smooth,  strain.     It  is  delicious. 

Fruit  Pudding — Dorothy  doesn't  think  Thanksgiving  is 
complete  unless  you  have  pudding.  This  is  made  by  stirring 
together  34  cupful  melted  butter,  x/%  cupful  of  maple  syrup  and 
3-2  cupful  of  milk.  Sift  2  scant  cupfuls  of  flour  with  %  teaspoon 
of  soda,  a  pinch  each  of  cinnamon,  cloves  and  nutmeg.  Mix 
the  ingredients  together  and  add  1  cup  chopped  seeded  raisins,  Y 
cup  chopped  figs, }  2  cup  chopped  hickory  nut  meats.  Add  to  this 

mixture  2  well  beaten  eggs  and 
turn  into  a  greased  mold.  Cover 
and  steam  three  to  three  and 
three-quarter  hours.  Garnish 
with  glace  fruit. 

Pumpkin  Tarts — A  favorite 
with  Phyllis!  Mix  together  IJ/2 
cups  of  sifted  cooked  pumpkin, 
Y2  cup  of  sugar,  34  cup  of  maple 
syrup,  ¥2  teaspoon  each  of 
ginger,  cinnamon  and  nutmeg. 
Add  34  cupful  of  melted  butter, 
34  teaspoon  of  salt,  1  cup  of  rich 
milk  and  3  well  beaten  eggs. 
Line  small  tart  tins  with  a  flaky 
pastry.  Fill  with  pumpkin  cus- 
tard and  bake.  These  tarts  may 
be  covered  with  either  whipped 
cream  or  meringue.

The    Hollywood    Side   Of   Make-Up 


By    Carolyn    Van    Wyck 


IRNEST  WESTMORE  is 

—  giving  Dorothy  Wilson  her 
irst  lesson  in  screen  make-up. 
Mr.  Westmore  suggests  two 
good  ideas  for  us  all — that 
towel  to  protect  the  hair 
from  powder  and  cream  and 
that  soft  brush  to  remove  sur- 
plus powder.  Brushes  come 
for  this  make-up  purpose. 


LILVAX  TASHMAN  has  a  reputation  for 
chic — and  a  well-deserved  one.  I  think 
one  of  the  secrets  of  her  achievement 
might  be  change,  constant  change.  For  every 
time  I  see  her  she  springs  a  new  surprise  in 
costume  or  hair  or  make-up. 

This  month  1  asked  her  how  often  she 
changed  her  coiffure.  "When  everyone  begins 
copying  it  and  it  becomes  commonplace,  then  I 
change,"  she  told  me. 

There,  I  think,  is  the  germ  of  an  idea  for  us 
all.  Few  of  us  are  born  with  the  magic  touch 
of  natural  beauty;  few  of  us  have  the  natural 
art  of  wearing  clothes  like  a  Parisian  manne- 
quin. 

But  all  of  us  can  study  ourselves,  detect  our 
beauty  weaknesses  and  strengths,  develop  the 
small  arts  and  graces  that  make  one  girl  stand 
out  from  another. 

/"*\NE  of  the  first  needs  is  to  avoid  the 
^-A>bvious.  To  wear  the  colors  of  the 
moment  because  everyone  is  doing  so.  to 
choose  lines  of  the  mode  with  no  regard  for 
figure,  to  cut  and  curl  the  hair  in  stereotyped 
Styles  is  a  grave  mistake. 

There  is  probably  no  one  else  exactly  like 
you  or  me  in  the  world. 

That  is  both  a  comforting  and  a  discomforting 
thought.  Hut  there  are  our  types.  And  these 
should  be  our  guides.  Even  then  we  have  the 
re  sponsibility  of  using  our  own  imaginations  to 
a  small  degree,  adding  this,  taking  away  that. 

This  development  of  self,  of  individuality,  is 
a  dominating  aim  among  the  lovely  women  of 
Hollywood.  There  individuality  comes  at  a 
high  premium. 

Each  star  and  starlet  strives  to  be  herself  in 
appearance  as  well  as  personality,  to  eliminate 
always  the  copybook  idea  of  being  like  her 
neighbor*

AN  attractive  face 
and  good  figure  are

looks.  Our  skin  beauty

attain  both.  Then  there

AND  here  is  Harriet  Hag- 
man  in  the  hands  of 
Ernest  Westmore,  who  is 
working  a  little  art  with  eye 
shadow.  You'd  be  surprised 
at  the  actual  screen  effect  pro- 
duced by  shadow.  That 
paint  brush  has  many  beauty 
uses,  even  for  conventional 
make-up.    Keep  one  on  hand. 


STICK  to  your  type  but  remember  that  even 
your  type  is  very  variable.  A  soft  hairline 
may  be  becoming  to  you,  but  there  are  a  dozen 
and  one  ways  of  achieving  the  effect.  There 
are  your  color  limitations,  too,  both  in  clothes 
and  make-up.  But  change  them  about.  If  you 
wear  pastel  shades  for  evening,  change  to  a 
white  or  even  black.  If  you  use  a  pale  rose 
rouge  with  your  pastels,  use  a  more  intense 
shade  for  your  black  frocks. 

Don't  think  that  clothes  and  personal  loveli- 
ness are  a  cut  and  dried  subject.  Both  are  the 
most  elastic,  changeable  matters  in  the  wcrld. 

Change,  constant  change,  should  be  your 
personal  secret  that  will  make  you  forever  new 
and  exciting  to  those  about  you  and  to  your- 
self. 

YOUNG  Mitzi  Green,  I  understand,  is  tem- 
porarily a  blonde,  and  a  curled  blonde  at 
that.  The  change  is  for  her  role  as  Orplum 
Annie.  Mitzi  does  not  think  so  much  of  the 
transformation,  but  it  is  all  for  the  best  in  her 
forthcoming  picture.  So  when  you  see  your 
favorite  players  suddenly  gone  blonde  or  red- 
head or  brunette,  don't  think  it  is  a  little  whim 
of  their  own  personal  %-anity.  It  is  probably 
because  a  role  calls  for  them  like  that  or  be- 
cause they  may  photograph  better. 

IT  is  both  surprising  and  encouraging  to  know 
how  many  Hollywood  stars  care  for  their  own 
beauty.  Katharine  Hepburn,  pictured  else- 
where, who  manicures  her  own  nails;  Norma 
Shearer  who  curls  her  own  hair;  Fifi  Dorsay, 
whose  own  sister  colors  Fifi's  hair  that  shining 
black  to  please  the  audience,  when  it  is  natu- 
rally a  tawny  shade. 

So  if  your  income  has  stylishly  dwindled, 
don't  think  you  are  one  of  the  world's  unfor- 
tunates because  you  have  to  do  for  yourself.

Marlene  Dietrich  has  a  rhythm  all  I 
its  own  when  you  pronounce  it  right — 
Mar-lay '-na  Dee'-trick. 

Claudette   Colbert  is  easy   to   say

Lyda  Roberti  is  Lee-da  Ro-ber'-tee

different  when  her  Polish  friends  say  it. 

Una  Merkel  is  Eu-na  Mer-kel'.

Hollywood's  Make-Up  Genius  Tells 
How  to  Always

Look  Young 

MAKE-UP 


*  KAY  FRANCIS 


HOLLYWOOD— Color  is  the  life 
and  attraction  of  youthful  beauty,  and  this 
secret  of  color  attraction  is  the  magic 
principle  in  a  new  kind  of  make-up 
created  for  the  screen  stars,  and  you,  by 
Max  Factor,  Hollywood's  genius  of 
make-up. 

For  twenty  odd  years  Max  Factor  has 
created  make-up  for  Hollywood's  motion 
picture  world.  From  this  unique  expe- 
rience has  come  this  original  discovery 
...cosmetic  color  harmony.  A  make-up 
ensemble  for  street  wear. .  .powder, 
rouge,  lipstick  and  other  requisites  ...  in 
color  harmony  for  every  type  of  blonde, 
brunette,  brownette  and  redhead. 

You'll  be  amazed  at  the  difference  in 
youthful  beauty  gained.  Each  shade  in 
face  powder,  for  example,  is  created  to 
some  screen  star  type.  Not  a  flat  color, 
but  a  color  harmony  tone  composed  of 
scientifically  balanced  chromatic  colors. 
Thus,  off-color,  spotty  and  powdery  ef- 
fects are  overcome.  A  face  powder  so 
soft  and  silk-like  in  texture,  it  blends  in- 
visibly with  the  skin... yet  imparts  a 
lovely,  delicate,  natural  color  tone. 


in    Warner  Bros    "  The  Jewel  Robbery" 
Max  Factor's  Make-Up  used  exclusively. 

It  creates  that  satin-smooth  make-up 
you've  admired  on  the  screen.  Velvety, 
you  may  be  sure  it  never  "shines,"  and 
it  clings  for  hours,  too,  for  screen  stars 
will  not  trust  a  powder  that  fluffs  away. 

A  luxury,  created  originally  for  the 
stars  of  the  screen,  now  available  to  you 
at  the  nominal  price  of  one  dollar  a  box.

This  Is  Bob  Montgomery 


( ii utility  with  Bob  is  rial,  not  slung  about  him 
like  a  garment.  To  be  removed  at  times. 
There  is  an  unstudied  ease  about  him  that  he- 
speaks  a  gentleman  horn.    I  [e  can  spot  a  broad 

"a"  Jane  and  a  false  pose  at  once.    And  loathes 
both. 

GIVEN   to  justifiable  hoastfulness,  when  he 
hiM    arrived    in    Hollywood,  he   was  a  bit 
■  Lerstood. 

The  boasts  have  somehow  disappeared  from 
Bob  Montgomery,  lie  knows  now,  after  three 
years  in  Hollywood,  there  are  many  things  that 
Can't  be  done. 

He's  quieter.  And  thinks  the  best  definition 
of  Hollywood  he  ever  heard  is,  "Newark  with 
palm  trees." 

He's  the  despair  of  every  photographer  on 
the  lot.  They  could  lie  down  and  die  in  agony 
v.hen  they  see  him  coming.  Hut  they  have  to 
admit  they've  had  the  best  time  they've  had  in 
\cars. 

First  he  runs  to  the  victrola  and  on  goes 
"Manhattan  Blues."  Ta  ta,  ta  ta.  Te  turn, 
te    turn. 

The  photographer  places  him  so.  Sud- 
denly he's  into  a  tango. 

The  amazed  photographer  in  his  arms. 
Twirl.    Dip.    Glide. 

Finally  the  photographer  falls  prostrate,  wip- 
ing his  brow.  Feebly  motioning  to  shut  off 
the  phonograph. 

"Manhattan  Blues"  begins  all  over  again. 
The  photographer  calmly,  careful  to  keep  out 
of  Bob's  clutches,  poses  him  so.  Now  ready! 
Snap! 

And  up  goes  Bob's  thumb  to  his  nose  and 
such  a  print  as  that  turns  out  to  be  for  Louis 
IS.  Mayer   to  look  at.    Teh.    Teh.    Teh. 

He's  impulsive  and  generous  to  a  fault.  He'll 
be  seized  with  the  idea  of  buying  all  his  friends 
a  present  and  nothing  can  stop  him.  And  no 
one  is  forgotten. 

He's  lived  in  four  houses  since  he  arrived  in 
}  lolly  wood  and  has  never  owned  one.  He  rents 
the  comfortable  but  unpretentious  home  in 
which  he  now-  lives.  And  makes  no  attempt  at 
swankiness. 

He  and  Betty,  his  wife,  are  like  every  ether 
happy  and  fairly  contented  suburban  couple. 
Having  dinners  at  friends'  homes  or  going  to 
the  theaters. 

And  no  orgies  worth  mentioning. 

But  he  does  have  a  passion  for  telephones. 
And  has  a  gadget  in  his  house  that  switches  a 
call  from  room  to  room.  He  goes  about  tele- 
phoning from  room  to  room  and  will  call  up 
New  York  with  the  slightest  encouragement. 
Or  even  without. 

He  thinks  Madge  Evans  is  a  grand  and  an 
ideal  girl.  And  he  still  writes  to  the  person  who 
sent  him  his  first  fan  letter,  which  Bob  received 
by  mistake. 

It  was  meant  for  another  actor  and  Bob 
promptly  refused  to  give  it  up  and  wrote  the 
astonished  fan  for  another  one. 

•"pO  Reginald  Denny's  mountain  cabin  he'll 
*•  go  during  the  winter,  snowed  in  for  days. 
Or  off  deep  sea  fishing. 

He  likes  a  man's  sport.  With  a  man's  share 
of  hardships. 

He  has  a  certain  charm  that  works  well.  As 
a  mere  featured  player,  day  after  day  in  his 
rattling  Dodge  roadster,  he  smiled  his  way  past 
the  gateman.  Which  certainly  was  against  the 
rules.  And  once  in,  he'd  park  it  very  grandly 
before  Marion  Davies'  or  Joan  Crawford's 
front  door. 

Today,  he  drives  through  in  his  shining  new 
Cadillac.  With  the  same  smile  for  the  gate- 
man. 

One  day  he  drove  that  Cadillac  across  tin 
street    from    M-G-M    to    Charlie    Bickford's 

lOJf 


I  MM  I  1)  FROM   I'  '■'  I     • 

garage.  A  young  boy  anil  his  sister  sat  in  a 
rickety  old  Ford  with  a  Texas  license. 

" O-o-o-o-o-o,  Bob  Montgomery,"  he  heard 
them  say.  And  strolled  over.  They  told  him 
they'd  sat  there  since  early  morning,  hoping 
someone  would  come  out  of  the  studio  they 
could  see  before  starting  back  to  Texas  next 
day.  And  he  was  the  only  one  they'd  seen. 
He  loaded  them  both  in  his  car.  Through  the 
magic  portal  of  the  studio  gate  they  drove.  All 
over  the  lot  they  went.  Stopping  to  speak  to 
Joan  Crawford,  Jimmy  Durante  and  Marie 
Dressier.  Then  out  to  Beverly  Hills  where 
Bob  pointed  out  the  homes  of  the  various  stars. 
Making  them  up  when  he  didn't  know.  But 
who  cared?  For  two  youngsters  left  the  next 
day  for  Texas.  With  a  song  in  their  hearts  for 
Bob  Montgomery. 

He  will,  in  spite  of  everything,  pick  up  hitch- 
hikers. Coming  from  Denny's  mountain 
cabin,  needing  a  shave  and  wearing  an  old 
sweater,  he  picked  up  a  lad  about  fourteen  who 
immediately  placed  Bob  as  a  chauffeur. 

The  boy  had  tramped  all  the  way  across  the 
states  and  was  on  his  way  to  Glendale.  To  find 
a  long  lost  aunt.  Bob  drove  him  there  and 
then  spent  the  balance  of  the  day  going  from 
place  to  place,  inquiring,  "Excuse  me,  lady, 
but  do  you  know  a  Mrs.,"  and  so  on  and  so  on. 
The  boy  found  his  aunt.  But  as  to  the 
chauffeur  who  helped  him  he  doesn't  know  vet 
it  was  a  very  famous  movie  star.  One  Robert 
(alias  Harry)  Montgomery. 

T— FE'S  hard  to  place.  A  person  hard  to  define. 
■*■  -*-He  isn't  a  wise-cracking  nit-wit  or  a  man 
overburdened  with  seriousness.  Somewhere  be- 
tween is  the  real  Bob.  But  most  of  all,  he's  a 
tremendous  trouper. 

His  baby  lay  dying.  The  call  from  the 
hospital  came.  "Come,"  it  said.  The  last  re- 
maining scene  of  "Lovers  Courageous"  was 
ready  to  be  shot.  The  delay  meant  thousands 
of  dollars. 

"Let's  do  it."  Bob  said. 

Over  and  over  they  rehearsed.  And  without 
a  whimper  of  complaint,  but  a  soul  full  of 
suffering  creeping  out  of  his  eyes,  Bob  went 
into   the   scene. 

"Let's  travel,"  he  said  to  Madge  Evans  in 
the  picture.  "No,"  she  replied,  "let's  have  a 
baby." 

And  after  he'd  gone,  a  crew  of  hard-boiled 
workmen,  actors  and  the  director  sat  down  and 
openly  and  shamelessly  wept. 

For  a  man  like  Bob  Montgomery 

Cay  or  depressed.  Bob  rows  as  if  the  Indians, 
including  Sitting  Bull,  were  after  him. 

He  sings  Grand  Opera  in  the  shower;  any- 
how, he  thinks  it's  opera.  And  he  always  eats 
the  same  breakfast — year  in.  year  out — 
Christmas  or  just  another  Monday.  It  con- 
sists of  one  glass  of  orange  juice,  two  soft  boiled 
eggs,  one  glass  of  milk,  three  pieces  of  toast 
and  two  slices  of  bacon. 

He's  cither  a  picture  of  what  the  well- 
dressed  man  not  only  will,  but  does  wear,  or 
a  downtrodden  beachcomber.  His  clothes,  even 
in  the  downtrodden  state,  are  always  immac- 
ulate and  good.  It's  the  way  he  puts  them 
on. 

A  collar  is  something  he  won't  wear  unless 
he's  going  to  a  party  or  is  in  a  picture.  He  will 
dangle  a  scarf  about  his  throat  instead — 
always  an  expensive  and  line  one. 

He  wears  white  linen  evening  suits  with 
short  white  Eton  jackets  Why  men  should  go 
about  sweltering  in  more  clothes  than  an 
Eskimo  is  beyond  him.  so  he'll  wear  his  linen 
suit  and  let  who  will  be  thunder-struck. 

He's  never  [ate  to  a  dinner  party;  thinks  it 
beastly  rude;  and  will  invariably  arrive  on  time 
and  wait,  a  lone  soldier,  two  hours  and  thirty- 
seven  minutes,  for  the  others  to  arrive. 


Bob  loathes  large  parties  and  thinks  more 
than  twelve  at  one  gathering  is  simply  an  un- 
intelligent mass  of  people,  all  talking  and 
howling  at  once. 

I  h  lias  the  happy  faculty  of  being  able  to  do 
a  lot  of  things  well.  He  can  ride  a  surf-board 
like  a  Hawaiian,  or  whoever  it  is  rides  surf- 
boards; he  rides  horseback,  plays  a  fair  game  of 
tennis,  a  better  game  of  golf,  a  solid  game  of 
bridge,  and  a  line  game  of  polo. 

HTWO  years  ago  he  played  tennis  constantly, 
■*-  and  nothing  else.  One  year  ago  it  was  goln 
And  now  it's  polo — to  the  exclusion  of  every- 
thing else,  except  an  occasional  hand  of  bridge. 
If  there's  one  thing  that  bores  him  to  tea 
people  who  play  bridge  by  rules.  Bob  play] 
constantly  by  rules  and  never  suspects  it,  for 
he  absorbs  every  rule  he  hears. 

He  owns  three  polo  ponies  that  cost  him 
exactly  SI  10  a  month  to  keep,  for  he  belongs  to 
a  club  that  buys  feed  by  the  carload  at  whole- 
sale rates.  The  stalls  are  S5.00  per  month.  He 
didn't  pay  over  $200  for  any  of  his  ponies. 

His  polo  suits  are  the  most  expensive  thing 
about  the  game.    You  should  see  those  pa 

He  loves  to  wear  a  ring,  but  never 
claiming  it  brings  a  curse  on  him  or  something. 
Every  time  he  wears  a  ring  something  happens. 
He  wore  a  ring  during  the  making  of  his  first 
picture,  "So  This  Is  College,"  and  right  when 
his  biggest  scene  arrived,  someone  stole  his 
pants. 

The  director  waited  and  the  co-eds  waited, 
and  here  was  Bob,  pantsless.  So  he  threw  the 
ring  away. 

He  claims  he  knows  absolutely  nothing  about 
business.  He  knows  the  only  directions  stocks 
go  is  up  or  down  like  an  elevator,  but  why  they 
do  it,  he  can't  imagine. 

And  he's  one  of  the  few  who  never  lost  a 
cent,  crisis  or  no  crisis. 

He  lives  on  an  allowance  and  has  someone  to 
take  care  of  financial  affairs.  His  allowance 
usually  runs  out  by  Saturday  and  sends  him 
wildly  scurrying  about  trying  to  borrow  fifty 
cents  until  Monday. 

He  eats  cheese  and  crackers  between  every 
meal  and  far  into  the  night.  Once  he  was 
spotted  with  Garbo.  while  both  were  eating 
from  the  same  apple — Bob  taking  a  bite,  then 
Garbo. 

Garbo,  to  quote  him,  is  an  "amazing  critter" 
and  a  really  nice  Swedish  girl.  He  gave  his 
worst  performance  with  Garbo  in  "Inspira- 
tion." 

Not.  as  has  been  hinted,  that  he  was  afraid 
of  Garbo,  but  because  no  one  ever  told  him 
what  he  was  supposed  to  be. 

It  seems  no  one  could  ever  find  out.  Even 
with  diagrams.  So  he  wandered  around  in  a 
daze  not  knowing  whether  he  was  Garbo's  uncle 
or  what. 

GARBO  is  right  about  seclusion,  he  thinks. 
Believes  every  star  should  keep  himself  a 
mystery.  So  the  fans  can  get  the  thrill  of 
something  deep  and  glamorous.  As  they  do 
with  Garbo. 

But  how  to  go  about  being  thrilly  and  glam- 
orous has  him  stumped. 

He  is  curious  about  successful  people.  And 
likes  to  take  them  apart  to  find  out  what 
makes  them  go. 

But  for  friends,  he  sticks  to  the  old  ones  he 
had  before  stardom  and  fame.  He  likes  people, 
he  claims,  who  are  sincere,  have  nice  teeth, 
and  an  integrity  of  purpose. 

There  is  an  innate,  well-bred  something 
about  him  that  one  senses,  rather  than  - 

A  visitor  on  Bob  Montgomery's  set  receives 
a  chair,  a  cool  drink  of  water,  and  every  kind 
attention.

Cal  York's  Monthly  Broadcast 
From  Hollywood 


CONTINUED  FROM  PACE  99  ] 


PRODUCED,  directed  and  photographed  by 

an  extra  and  played  by  three  other  extra 
people,  a  little  featurette  titled  "Breakwater" 
will  be  included  in  the  Warner  Bros,  releases 
this  season.  The  entire  picture  is  without  dia- 
logue or  titles  and  was  filmed  at  a  cost  of  less 
than  five  hundred  dollars. 

Mike  Siebert  has  cherished  the  dream  of 
producing  on  his  own  ever  since  chance  made 
him  a  director  for  a  day.  An  extra  in  "Moby 
Dick,"  without  invitation,  he  sat  in  on  the 
preview.  Someone,  possibly  in  jest,  asked  his 
opinion. 

Barrymore's  encounter  with  the  whale  wasn't 
all  it  should  be.  The  sequence  hadn't  been 
properly  built-up.  There  should  be  more 
scenes  in  the  water.  This  was  needed  to  add 
punch.  That  to  heighten  drama.  So  Mike 
was  put  in  charge  of  the  crew  that  filmed 
the  added  scenes.  He  was  given  the  job  of 
directing  the  great  Barrymore — of  barely 
drowning  him,  according  to  Barrymore.  But 
Mike  got  the  scenes. 

Now  Mike  is  a  full-fledged  director.  But 
he  plans  to  continue  plugging  along  as  an  extra. 

fVVERHEARD  between  a  song  writer  and  a 
^casting  director  on  the  Paramount  lot: 
''Got  someone  to  play  George  Washington?"- 


"Yeah,  got  Alan  Mowbray." 

"Swell,  he'll  be  great  for  the  part." 

"  Yeah,  but  he  says  he  won't  do  that  song 
and  dance. " 

"He  won't?    Well,  the  so  and  so.  .  . 

"  Got  a  swell  fellow  to  play  Thomas  JfJfcrsoM, 
too.    Tall  fellow." 

"Fine.  We  can  let  Jefferson  do  the  son! 
maybe,  and  either  Roosevelt  or  Lincoln  can  gt 
into  the  dance.    How's  that?" 

"  Great  idea.    Yeah,  that's  what  we  can  do  J 

"Well,  see  you  later." 

"Yeah.    So  long. "

need  the  protection,  as  she  never  went  into  the

for  every  cent  she  spends — save  for  what  she 
does  with  the  seventy-five-doUar-a-week  salary 

she  is  allowed  for  her  work  as  guardian. 

Yes — to  put  it  in  plain  words,  Jackie 
Cooper  pays  his  own  mother  seventy-five 
dollars  a  week  salary  to  be  his  guardian  and 
administrator! 

What  Mrs.  Cooper  does  with  the  SI, 425 
weekly  balance  is  a  matter  that  the  courts 
must  pass  on,  first.  As  her  boy's  guardian,  she 
has  to  submit,  at  intervals,  a  budget  for  the 
court's  approval.  On  this  budget  must  be 
itemized  the  disposal  of  every  cent  of  Jackie's 
money — how  much  for  rent,  food,  make-up, 
clothing,  education,  transportation,  entertain- 
ment, and  all  the  thousand-and-one  expenses 
of  a  child  star. 

When  the  court  approves  the  budget,  Jack- 
ie's mother  must  stay  within  .its  limitations 
— and  must  prove  that  she  has  done  so  by  sub- 
mitting, at  intervals,  the  books  that  show 
where  the  money  has  been  spent  in  ac- 
cordance with  the  approved  budget. 

And  in  view  of  that  one  thousand-five  hun- 
dred-a-week  salary,  the  items  on  that  budget 
are  not  at  all  extravagant.  Just  one  example: 
S150  a  month,  for  rent.  Now  S150  a  month 
rent  is  probably  as  little  as  any  movie  star 
with  Jackie  Cooper's  income  ever  paid.  It 
pays  for  a  house  in  Beverly  Hills — and  SI 50  a 
month  for  a  Beverly  Hills  house  is  economy 
with  a  vengeance. 

The  greater  part  of  Jackie's  money  is  in- 
vested in  endowment  insurance  policies,  so 
scaled  that  when  he  reaches  his  twenties,  Jackie 
will  get  the  rewards  of  his  camera  labors  of 
today — some  in  outright  cash  payments,  some 
in    income-for-life    annuities — so    that    never 


again,  so  long  as  he  lives,  will  he  have  to  worry 
about  money 

If — and  what  a  big  word  that  if  is! — Jackie 
keeps  on  making  money  as  he  is  today,  and 
saving  it  as  his  mother  is  doing  for  him,  he'll 
be  a  millionaire  in  his  mid-twenties.  But  what 
odds?  And  there  is  one  other  angle  of  this 
huge-income  picture. 

It's  a  safe  bet  that  Jackie's  income-earning 
value  will  poof  out  within  a  couple  of  years. 
There's  no  case  on  record  where  a  child  star  of 
any  magnitude  lasted  more  than  a  few  years. 
Look  at  Jackie  Coogan — he  plays  a  role  now 
and  then,  but  compared  with  his  one-time 
fame,  he's  just  a  nonentity  now.  He  goes  to  a 
school  at  Santa  Clara,  California,  and  is  grow- 
ing up  into  a  nice-looking  but  hardly  out-of- 
the-ordinary  young  man.  Yes,  his  brother 
Bobby  is  the  star  of  the  family  today — but 
Bobby's  career  won't  be  any  longer  than 
Jackie's  was. 

And  that  brings  us  to  the  Coogans — a  dollar- 
crafty  family  who  also  knew  how  to  protect 
their  youngster's  earnings.  When  Jackie  flashed 
into  the  multi-dollar  class  with  his  performance 
in  "The  Kid,"  there  was  formed  the  Coogan 
Finance  Corporation,  under  the  able  financial 
managership  of  one  Arthur  L.  Bernstein. 
Bernstein,  with  the  not-to-be-escaped  okay  of 
the  courts,  was  empowered  to  take  and  invest 
the  earnings  of  the  Coogan  children.  Papa 
and  Mama  Coogan  kept  their  hands  off,  save 
for  the  income  they  were  legally  entitled  to  as 
members  of  the  Corporation — again,  with  the 
full  legal  approval  of  the  courts. 

And  so  it  is  that  while  Jackie  goes  to  a  fine 
school,  both  he  and  Bobby  (whom  you've 
seen  on  the  screen  thus  far  in  the  rags  and

tatters  of  make-believe  poverty)  are  really  mil- 
lionaires in  their  own  right. 

Let's  see  about  some  other? — 

There's  Dickie  Moore,  who  has  been  getting 
as  high  as  five  hundred  dollars  a  week,  but 
whose  contract  with  the  Roach  comedy  outfit 
— "Our  Gang,"  you  know — for  one  hundred 
fifty  dollars  a  week  over  a  long-term  has  been 
approved  by  the  courts.  Dickie's  mother 
planks  Dickie's  salary  check  into  a  good  old- 
fashioned  savings  account  each  week.  Big  in- 
come hasn't  gone  to  their  heads — they  still 
live  in  downtown  Los  Angeles,  in  the  ordinary 
quarters  where  they  lived  before  Dickie  be- 
came famous.  Virtually  the  only  change 
they've  made  in  their  mode  of  living  is  that 
Dickie  and  his  mother  now  ride  to  the  studio 
in  an  automobile,  instead  of  the  street  cars, 
as  they  used  to. 

"T  see  no  reason, "  says  Dickie's  mother,  "for 
■*■  making  a  splurge,  just  because  Dickie  hap- 
pens to  be  in  the  'big'  money.  There'll  come  a 
time  when  Dickie  will  grow  out  of  kid  roles 
— and  then  I'll  be  prepared,  with  the  money 
we're  putting  away  in  the  bank  now,  to 
see  him  through  the  awkward  period  that 
comes,  tragically  enough,  to  screen  kiddies." 

Mitzi  Green's  parents  are  co-trustees  with 
her  in  a  trust  fund  established  a  long  time  ago, 
when  she  first  began  to  scale  the  movie  heights. 
Mitzi  is  already  wealthy  in  her  own  name. 
The  only  monies  that  have  been  taken  out  of 
her  earnings  have  been  for  clothes,  pho- 
tographs, publicity,  and  other  items  purely 
part  of  her  professional  career.  Not  even  the 
family  home  is  paid  for  out  of  Mitzi's  money — 
it's  a  comfortable  place  on  Long  Island, 
bought  and  paid  for  by  Mitzi's  father  before 
the  girl  made  a  screen  hit. 

Little  Dorothy  Grey's  mother  was  left  an 
orphan  when  a  child.  She  learned  what 
poverty  meant. 

Now  that  Dorothy  is  making  a  good  movie 
income — well,  here's  her  mother's  explanation 
of  what  happens  to  the  money! 

"I  put  Dorothy  into  pictures  for  money,  not 
fame.  Now  we  have  a  roof  over  our  heads— 
and  a  lot  of  good  vacant  lots  that  will  insure 
the  future." 

Remember  Farina — that  l'il  cullud  tot? 
Well,  Farina's  day  in  pictures  is  already  past. 
But  Farina's  parents  knew  enough  to  invest 
the  youngster's  money  while  it  was  coming  in. 
Now  they  own  a  big  hotel  in  Los  Angeles' 
negro  belt,  and  Farina  won't  ever  have  to 
worry  over  the  future. 

"Spanky" — the  little  three-year-old  new- 
comer to  the  Roach  ranks,  now  earns  more 
money  than  his  father,  an  automobile  finance 
company  executive.  Business-trained,  that 
father  now  invests  all  of  Spanky's  earnings — 
with  the  approval  of  the  courts — in  gilt-edged 
paper.  "No  use  to  let  money  lie  idle,"  is 
Spanky's  father's  attitude. 

T\  7ELL,  there  you  are.  From  the  outside, 
W  at  quick  glance,  it  may  seem  like  a  swell 
idea  to  have  your  youngsters  drawing  down 
a  big  movie  pay-check  every  week.  But  it's 
Dot  so  sweet  as  it  seems.  Neither  for  mama 
nor  papa,  nor  for  the  kiddie.  And  that  brings 
to  mind  that  true  story  about  Jackie  Cooper 
down  at  the  beach  one  day.  He  was  play- 
ing  with  another  lad. 

"Didn't  I  see  you  at  the  studio  th'other 
day?"  Jackie  asked. 

"Yeah,"  said  the  other  boy,  "I  work  in 
pictures."  He  was,  it  turned  out,  one  of  the 
hundreds  of  extras,  who  get  five  dollars  a  day 
when  they  work. 

"How  much  d'ya  get?"  asked  Jackie,  as 
kids  will. 

"Me?  I  get  five  dollars  a  day,"  the  other 
lad  truthfully  replied. 

Jackie's  eyes  opened  wide.  "Gee,"  he 
finally  gasped,  "you  must  make  a  tiuwful  lot 
o'  money.    Me — I  only  get  fifty  cents  a  week." 

And  that's  true. 

Out  of  the  fifteen  hundred  dollars  he  earns, 
Jackie's  own  personal  spending  allotment  is 
a  four-bit  piece,  each  pay  day.

Oily  Skin  . . .  Dry  Skin  .  . .  Large  Pores  . . .  Black- 
heads .  .  .  are  these  distressing  skin  problems 
worrying  you? 

Among  the  612  women  of  all  ages  and  types  who 
participated  in  the  Half-face  Test  under  the 
supervision  of  15  of  the  country's  foremost  der- 
matologists were  many  women  with  these  skin 
problems. 

Each  day  these  women  cared  for  the  left  side  of 
their  faces  with  their  customary  creams,  soaps 
and  lotions.  On  the  other  side  each  applied  daily 
only  the  creamy  lather  of  Woodbury's  Facial 
Soap.  By  the  end  of  thirty  days  Woodbury's  had 
benefited  103  cases  of  blackheads,  83  cases  of 
coarse  pores,  115  cases  of  excessive  oiliness,  106 
cases  of  acne  and  81  cases  of  dry  skin.  Even 
"normal"  complexions  found  finer  texture,  a 
more  velvety  smoothness,  a  fresh  bloom  under 
the  gentle  stimulus  of  Woodbury's  Facial  Soap. 

The  reasons  for  this  are  deep  rooted  in  the  special 
formula  of  Woodbury's  which  was  created  by  a 
skin  specialist  and  contains  cosmetic  ingredients 
not  found  in  ordinary  toilet  soaps.  It  is  not  sold 
in  chip  or  flake  form  for  laundry  and  kitchen  use. 
It  is  much  too  fine  and  specialized  for  that. 
Woodbury's  is  a  facial  soap — providing  a  stimu- 
lating and  corrective  beauty  treatment. 

Begin  its  daily  use  tonight  and  prove  for  yourself

Lew  Wants  Another  Chance 


I  ONTIKUED  FROM  PA( 


broken,  the  sides  slaved  in  and  the  fenders 

hanging  by  wins.  It  ran  and  it  ran  well.  It 
gol  him  places  and  brought  him  hack. 

Had  Lew  U-en  the  only  thing  that  decrepit 
automobile  brought  hack,  this  story  would  he 
less  complicated. 

The  car's  hack  scat,  however,  took  on  the 
aspect  of  a  small  hoy's  pockets,  crammed  as 
it  constantly  was  with  larger  equivalents  of 
string,  marbles  and  tops. 

Lew  is  a  horn  collector.  Old  books,  ancient 
firearms,  telescopes — oh,  yes,  he's  studied  at 
the  Mount  Wilson  observatory  and  today  is 
recognized  as  a  well-advanced  amateur. 
Rocks — he's    interested    in    geology. 

Continuing  his  music  as  a  hobby  has  led 
Lew  into  original  compositions.  He  composes 
mostly  on  the  organ,  a  small,  portable  affair. 
Modern    interpretative    themes — not    jazz. 

His  artistic  urge  has  likewise  found  other 
experimental  expression.  He  sketches  a  little 
and  models  in  clay,  without  ever  having  taken 
lessons  in  art  or  anatomy.  Some  of  these 
small  figures  have  been  cast  into  book  ends 
and  similar  objects.  He  is  currently  engaged 
on  a  more  ambitious  figure,  that  of  a  slave- 
driver. 

This  piece  is  being  done  with  Lew  as  his 
own  model.  Whenever  he  is  in  doubt  about 
an  anatomical  line,  he  poses  himself  before 
a  large  mirror  to  determine  just  how  it 
should  be. 

"D  EFORE  his  marriage  to  Lola  Lane,  Lew's 
■'-'house  was  always  cluttered  with  his  "col- 
lections." Likely  as  not,  you  would  find 
modeling  clay  on  his  living-room  table  where 
it  would  remain  until  he  finished  a  figure. 
Lola,  however,  is  a  better  housekeeper.  She 
has  compelled  Lew  to  greater  tidiness.  All  of 
the  objects  of  his  collecting  hobbies  are  now 
segregated  in  one  place,  which  they  call  "the 
junk  room." 

Marriage  has  done  wonders  fcr  Lew  Ayres. 
In  Lola  he  has  found  an  understanding  given 
him  by  few  others  in  Hollywood.  Lola  also 
knows  the  artistic  urge  and  is  therefore  sym- 
pathetic. She  wants  to  write.  The  arrange- 
ment is  perfect.  She  seeks  her  desk  and  type- 
writer while  Lew  is  puttering  around  "the 
junk  room." 


At  the  same  time,  Lola  is  something  of  a 
balance  wheel  for  Lew.  The  very  fact  that 
he  has  a  wife  keeps  Lew  from  doing  many 
crazy,  impulsive  things.  It  is  seldom  that  his 
impulses  get  out  of  hand. 

Recently,  however,  it  took  Lola  a  whole 
morning  to  dissuade  him  from  hopping  a  fast 
freight   for  San    Diego. 

There  was  no  particular  reason  for  the  trip. 
which  made  it  twice  as  desirable.  Lew  has 
never  ridden  blind  baggage  and  he  wanted  the 
experience. 

YI7ISELY,    Lola    has    not    attempted    to 

w  change  Lew's  habits.     She  allows  him  1 1 

go  around  in  the  old  clothes  he  loves — a  thing 

so  few  young  wives  have  sense  enough  to  do. 

Xor  has  Lola  interfered  in  any  way  with  the 
friendship  that  has  existed  between  Lew  and 
his  pals  of  the  "All  Quiet"  days.  Billy  Bake- 
well,  Russell  Gleason  and  Ren  Alexander  a  e 
frequent  visitors  at  the  Ayres  home.  Togi 
they  form  as  delightfully  mad  a  quartet  as 
Hollywood  has  ever  seen.  Their  exuberance 
and  pranks  are  the  talk  of  the  town. 

Hollywood  understands  this  crowd  as  a 
gang,  just  as  it  has  failed  miserably  to  u 
stand  Lew  as  an  individual.  Into  his  desire  to 
exclude  himself  from  the  social  whirl  Holly- 
wood enjoys  has  been  read  a  false  meaning. 
Because  he  is  innately  shy  and  does  not  make 
new  friends  easily,  Hollywood  believed  that 
success  turned  his  head — enlarged  it.  All  <  f 
which  is  a  grave  injustice  to  the  real  Le  ■■■■ 
Ayres. 

But   now   it   will   be   different.     With    t!'e 
signing  of  his  new  contract  have  come 
responsibilities     and     new     ambition.       1.  w 
wants  to  make  good,  to  do  a  better  job  than 
that  well-nigh  perfect  one  in  "All  Quiet." 

"I  am  giving  up  all  my  hobbies  for  at  least 
a  year,"  he  says.  "I  want  to  devote  all  my 
time  and  energy  to  my  screen  work.  I  have 
even  put  a  lock  on  the  door  of  my  'junk  room.' 
Maybe  I'll  give  the  key  to  Lola  to  hide." 

Lew  is  putting  away  his  toys,  you  see.  He 
has  grown  up  to  the  stature  of  stardom. 

The  next  time  you  see  Lew  on  the  screen 
it  will  be  in  the  role  of  a  bull-fighter  in  a 
picture  called  "Men  Without  Fear."  A  good 
title  that,  tailored  to  fit  the  new  Lew  Ayres. 


Wliooie!    Here  Comes  Joe  E.

just  Joe  E.  walking  past  that  huge  sign  up  there 
that  said  JOE  E.  BROWN"  on  the  front  of  the 
theater  and  trying  to  see  if  it  were  visible 
from  all  angles,  to  anyone  whether  trotting, 
hopping  or  just  walking  past. 

Between  shows  he  tried  baseball.  The  thing 
he  loves  next  to  acting.  He  actually  belonged 
at  one  time  to  the  New  York  Giants.  But 
didn't  get  far  for,  you  see,  when  Joe  got  up 
to  bat  and  opened  his  mouth  to  grin,  the 
pitcher  refused  to  throw  the  ball. 

"What's  the  matter?"  the  umpire  asked. 

"Look  at  that,"  the  pitcher  said.  "I 
can't  throw  a  ball  at  that.  He'll  swallow  it. 
And  we're  short  on  balls." 

And  there  was  the  time  the  bases  were  full 
and  two  men  had  struck  out.  There  was  a 
moment  of  tense  silence  as  the  third  man  came 
to  bat. 

Xow.  The  pitcher  threw  the  ball.  The 
batter  swung.  He  hit  it  and  made  for  second 
base,  when  suddenly  Joe  let  out  that  "call  of  the 
wild"  yell  of  his  and  in  two  seconds  the  pitcher 
had  tramped  the  catcher  silly  trying  to  get 


out,  the  batter  was  still  running  two  blocks 
away,  the  umpire  lay  in  a  dead  swoon  and  the 
stadium  had  completely  emptied. 

So  Joe  kind  of  gave  up  baseball.  He  has 
his  own  ball  team  out  in  Hollywood  that  even 
belongs  to  a  league.  And  they  do  splendidly 
until  Joe  expands  the  "wide  open  spaces"  and 
lets  go  that  yell  in  the  wrong  places. 

He  claims  he  acquired  that  famous  yell  one 
summer  at  a  lakeside  camp.  When  the  rest 
of  the  boys  were  a  mile  or  so  off  shore  1  - 
and  Joe  wanted  to  call  them  in  for  breakfast, 
he  would  go  down  to  the  shore,  open  up  his 
mouth,  begin  a  sound  down  in  the  region  of 
the  larynx  and  finally  let  go  that  water 
buffalo  shout  that  not  only  brought  in  the 
fishermen  but  all  the  trading  boats  on  Lake 
Erie  as  well  And  Joe's  been  using  that  war 
whoop  ever  since. 

And  his  mouth,  strange  as  it  may  seem, 
isn't  too  noticeably  large  in  every  day  life. 
Unless  Joe  wants  it  to  be  and  opens  it  accord- 
ingly. Otherwise  it's  just  a  slightly  unusual 
opening  in  a  very  pleasant  countenance.

He  has  a  tremendous  following,  officially  rank- 
ing among  the  first  ten  in  box-office  pull.  And 
he's  really  considerate  and  thoughtful  of  his 
fans. 

His  is  one  of  the  few  contracts  that  defi- 
nitely state  every  fan  letter  must  be  taken 
care  of  with  no  expense  to  the  fan.  And  do 
they  write ! 

From  San  Francisco  comes  a  letter  from  a 
judge.  "Well,  Joe,"  he  writes,  "I  was  on  my 
way  to  a  doctor  last  night  when  I  passed  a 
movie  with  your  mug  out  front.  I  never  did 
care  for  doctors  so  I  decided  to  postpone  the 
ordeal  an  hour  or  two  and  see  my  friend  Joe 
again.  Why,  say,  you  shook  every  ill  and  pain 
out  of  me.  I  never  did  see  that  doctor,  you 
rascal,  you!" 

From  Bombay,  India:  "Dear  Sahib  Brown: 
I  never  fail  to  miss  one  of  your  pictures  when 
it  comes  here." 

And  Joe  is  still  scratching  his  head  over  that 
one. 

A  LSO,  there  was  the  time  Joe  was  having 
-**-luncn  at  a  fashionable  hotel  in  Washing- 
ton, D.  C.    About  him  sat  the  city's  best. 

Presently  a  beautiful  young  lady,  neatly 
dressed,  came  over  to  Joe's  table. 

"Mr.  Brown,"  she  said  a  little  confused. 
"I  have  a  favor  to  ask  of  you." 

"Why,  what  is  it?"  Joe  asked  in  surprise. 

"May  I  touch  you?"  she  blushingly  asked. 

"Why  certainly,"  Joe  grinned  sheepishly. 

She  laid  a  dainty  finger  on  his  sleeve. 

"Now  I  have  a  favor  to  ask  you,"  Joe  said. 

"Oh,  what?"  she  asked  breathlessly. 

"May  I  touch  you?" 

And  he  laid  a  finger  on  her  sleeve. 

And  then  as  though  it  were  the  most  natural 
thing  in  the  world,  they  bowed,  shook  hands 
and  departed. 

He's  a  home  body,  Joe  is.  In  love  with  his 
wife,  two  boys  and  baby  girl.  And  despite 
the  fact  he's  a  rather  serious  minded  and 
decidedly  unfunny  person  off  the  screen,  his 
two  boys,  fourteen  and  twelve,  think  he's  a 
card.  And  much  funnier  than  the  four  Marx 
Brothers.  Much.  Everything  he  says  is  a 
scream  to  the  boys. 

For  instance,  if  Mr.  Brown  remarks  to  Mrs. 
Brown  at  the  dinner  table  that  the  situation 
in  China  looks  bad,  the  boys  know  immediately 
Daddy  must  be  clowning  and  go  into  such 
hysterics  they  have  to  leave  the  table.  Isn't 
he  the  funny  one,  their  dad,  though? 

Then  there's  that  recent  high  excitement  out 
in  the  exclusive  suburb  of  Beverly  Hills. 

Strange,  ghostly  noises  were  issuing  nightly 
from  a  grand  mansion  on  one  of  the  very  quiet 
streets. 

It  went  on  for  a  week.  With  the  sounds 
growing  more  and  more  terrifying. 

Finally,  the  neighbors,  in  feverish  excite- 
ment, but  loathe  to  bring  in  vulgar  outsiders, 
were  unable  to  control  themselves  further,  and 
summoned  the  cops. 

Aforesaid  cops  were  awed  as  they  crowded 
past  several  butlers  and  footmen.  Up  the  taste- 
fully carpeted  stairs  their  big  feet  tore  to 
where  the  sounds  issued  from  a  front  room. 

As  one,  they  made  a  dash  for  the  door  only  to 
have  two  sedate  and  composed  French  maids 
open  the  door. 

In  the  center  of  the  room  stood  madam 
looking  at  them  in  astonishment.  They  stared 
back  at  her  in  equal  astonishment. 

"\\  7HAT,"  she  demanded,  in  icy,  cultured 
W  tones,  "is  the  meaning  of  this?" 
She  raised  a  gold  lorgnette    and  peered  at 
them  haughtily. 

"Why, — that  is,  lady,"  Officer  Reilly  stam- 
mered, "we  heard  a  terrible  noise  and  came  to 
investigate." 

"The  idea,"  the  dowager  sniffed.  "Can't  a 
lady  practice  yelling  like  Joe  E.  Brown  with- 
out the  entire  police  force  interrupting?" 

And  they  carefully  tiptoed  downstairs  and 
outside. 

While  upstairs  a  great  social  light  went  on 
with  her  practicing  of  yelling  like  Joe  E.  Brown.

l\  laxative  that  gets  its  results  through 
a  violent  purging  of  the  intestines  is 
worse  than  no  laxative  at  all.  For  that's 
too  big  a  price  to  pay  for  temporary  re- 
lief from  constipation.  Such  cathartics 
disturb  digestion.  They  upset  the  stom- 
ach. They  shock  the  nervous  system. 
They  are  not  good  for  you! 

Next  to  Nature — Ex-Lax 

The  best  laxative  is  the  one  that  comes 
closest  to  Nature's  own  way  of  acting. 
Ex-Lax  gently  stimulates  the  bowels  to 
action.  It  does  not  impair  the  normal 
junctions  of  the  intestines.  It  does  not 
shock  the. system.  It  doesn't  gripe.  It 
helps  Nature  to  help  herself! 

No  secret  about  Ex-Lax 

Ex-Lax  is  simply  that  scientific  laxative 
ingredient — phenolphthalein — of  the  right 
quality,  in  the  right  proportion,  in  the 
right  dose  —  combined  with  delicious 
chocolate  in  the  special  Ex-Lax  way. 

That's  why  Ex-Lax  is  so  gentle,  why 
it  is  not  habit-forming.   Ex-Lax  checks 
on  every  point  your  doctor  looks  for  in  ! 
a  laxative. 

Give  Ex-Lax  a  trial! 

There's  only  one  way  to  know  that

I  CONTINUED  FROM  PACE  4'' 


Admittedly,  it  was  a  Latin  sense  of  humor 
and  one  that  appreciated  pranks  more  readily 
than  subtleties.  Hut,  whereas  Ramon  always 
has  an  appreciation  of  poetry  and  things  poetic, 
he  had,  at  the  same  time,  a  love  of  fun. 

T\  7HEX  he  first  entered  pictures — twelve 
w  years  ago — PHOTOPLAY  asked  him  to  fill 
out  the  usual  biographical  formula  for  the  files 
and  when  he  came  to  the  question" -Married?" 
Ramon  wrote — "Xo,  not  that  I  remember."  It 
wasn't  a  very  funny  joke,  but  Ramon  was  very 
young  then  and  probably  thought  it  was.  So 
the  super-serious  young  man  sort  of  falls  apart, 
doesn't  he,  when  one  starts  to  analyze  him? 

People  who  know  Ramon — and  have  known 
him  for  years — know  him  to  be  a  good  fellow,  a 
good  Mexican  (to  whom  light  wines  and  danc- 
ing are  far  from  unknown)  and  fun  at  a  party. 

When  he  was  making  a  sea  picture  and  the 
company  was  on  location  at  Long  Beach, 
I  went  down  to  spend  a  few  days  to  watch  the 
players  work.  At  night  after  dinner,  Ramon 
gathered  a  group  of  us  together  in  his  room  to 
indulge  in  a  little  impromptu  party.  We 
laughed  ourselves  sick  that  night.  I  remember 
that  Ramon  showed  us  a  goofy  Mexican  card 
game,  but  didn't  show  it  to  us  very  well,  and 
we,  being  confused  by  the  whole  process,  could 
do  nothing  but  let  him  win — which  was  exactly 
Ramon's  idea. 

All  the  bunk  written  about  Ramon;  the 
recluse  Ramon;  the  actor  longing  for  the  priest- 
hood; Ramon  the  poet  with  head  in  the  clouds, 
amused  Ramon's  friends — the  friends  who  were 
privileged  to  know  him  as  he  was. 

And  then  a  terrific  change  came  about  in 
Hollywood,  itself. 

The  place  went  grand,  it  went  social,  it 
became  more  keenly  publicized. 

Ramon  underwent  a  change,  too.  His  old 
friends  scattered — Alice  Terry,  Rex  Ingram 
and  Kate  Key  in  France,  Renee  Adoree  ill,  his 
pals  in  the  publicity  department  gone  to  seek 


other  jobs.  Added  to  this,  Ramon's  brother 
died — a  brother  whom  he  loved  devotedly  and 
whom  he  was  sending  through  college.  Ramon 
did  more  or  less  shut  himself  off,  as  anyone 
would  do  at  a  time  like  that.  He  did,  also,  do 
some  thinking. 

The  death  of  a  loved  one  invariably  leaves 
a  mark  and  it  started  Ramon  to  dwelling  along 
more  mature  lines. 

A  new  crop  of  actors  came  to  California,  in- 
troducing new  ways  to  the  old  guard — of  which 
Ramon  was  one.  The  legend  of  Ramon  No- 
varro and  his  mysterious  life  (which  was  just 
about  as  mysterious  as  the  workings  of  a  row 
boat)  was  recounted  and  because  none  of  his 
old  friends  were  there  to  tell  them  any  different . 
the  new  Hollywood  believed  all  the  things  that 
have  been  printed  about  him. 

And  that  is  why  the  new  Hollywood  thought 
it  had  discovered  Ramon.  For  he  met  new 
friends  and  was  gay  with  them  as  he  had  been 
with  the  old.  The  grief  of  his  brother's  death 
took  its  rightful  place  in  his  scheme  of  things. 
He  began  going  out  again.  And  people 
pounced  on  that  and  said  Ramon  had  changed. 

Ramon  has  grown  mentally  in  eleven  years. 
His  youthful  ideals  have  been  fairly  well 
rubbed  off,  as  youthful  ideals  usually  are. 
Ramon  proved  himself  not  only  a  star,  but  a 
director  as  well.  But  he  has  never  been  an 
aesthete  and  never  a  recluse.  Of  course  he  has 
changed,  but  he  has  changed  far  less  than  the 
people  who  talk  about  him  would  have  you 
believe. 

/^\XCE  he  went  to  small,  informal  parties — 
^since  they  were  the  only  sort  Hollywood 
gave  at  the  time.  Xbw  he  goes  to  large,  formal, 
elaborate  affairs — because  that's  the  fad  of  the 
moment. 

And  if  anybody  ever  again  tells  you  that 
Ramon  was  once  a  deeply  religious  introvert, 
who  suddenly  blossomed  into  a  good  time 
Charlie — you'll  know  the  answer  to  that  one. 


Why  Chevalier  Sits  Alone 


CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  29 


And  Chevalier  smiled  one  of  his  rare  off-screen 
smiles. 

"Sometimes  I  forget.  But  it  never  forgets. 
I  get  a  flash  and  things  go  black  before  my 
eyes.  The  flash  seldom  lasts  long,  but  I  am 
upset  for  days." 

Chevalier's  reticence  in  discussing  his  injury 
is  paralleled  by  his  dislike  of  talking  about  the 
war.  even  in  generalities.  "I  was  in  the  service 
so  short  a  time,"  he  says.  Then  resorting  to 
his  favorite  method  of  evasion,  "There  is 
nothing  to  tell." 

Again  I  must  quarrel  with  you,  Monsieur. 
Any  man  who  fell  on  the  battlefield  fighting 
for  his  country,  who  was  captured  by  the 
enemy  to  be  interned  twenty-six  months  in 
a  prison  camp  only  to  escape  by  a  dangerous 
ruse,  who  was  awarded  the  Croix  tie  Guerre  for 
his  bravery — any  man  who  has  suffered  such 
experiences,  has  a  great  deal  to  tell. 

rT",RUE.  your  active  services  as  a  soldat  were 
*■  brief  in  point  of  time.  France  declared  war 
on  Germany  August  3,  L914.  You  were  among 
the  very  first  to  go.  Xinetcen  days  after  the 
declaration  of  war,  you  lay  in  a  hospital  be- 
hind the  German  lines,  cruelly  wounded. 

You  were  treated  by  enemy  doctors.  You  do 
not  complain  of  the  treatment  you  received 
though,  chances  are,  had  you  been  in  more 
interested  hands,  you  would  not  be  carrying 
shrapnel  in  your  chest  today.     Possibly  they 


did  the  best  they  could  for  you — the  best 
considering  the  fact  you  were  just  one  of  many 
hundred  wounded,  most  of  whom  were  country- 
men, not  alien  French. 

•"THE  surface  of  his  wound  healed  and  Cheva- 
*-  lier  was  sent  to  a  German  prison  camp.  Far 
from  strong,  the  rigid  discipline  and  unsani- 
tary conditions  of  the  camp  retarded  his  re- 
turn to  health.  These  were  days  of  mental 
torture  much  more  maddening  than  any 
physical  injury.  As  a  prisoner  of  war,  Chcva» 
lier  first  learned  to  sit  alone. 

His  companions  were  mostly  Russian  and 
English.  He  did  not  speak  their  language, 
and  conversation  had  to  be  carried  on  through 
interpreters.  Chevalier's  habit  of  sitting 
silently  in  a  crowd  was  born  under  such  cir- 
cumstances. 

Slowly  Chevalier  mended  as  month  followed 
dreary  month  and  the  second  monotonous  year 
neared  its  end.  Imprisoned  Red  Cross  work- 
ers were  to  be  exchanged  by  France  and  Ger- 
many. Chevalier  decided  to  take  a  desperate 
chance.  He  falsified  his  papers  to  pose  as  a 
member  of  the  Red  Cross  and  filed  an  applica- 
tion that  would  put  him  on  the  exchange  list. 

The  penalty  for  such  an  action  was  court 
martial  and  a  probable  death  sentence.  The 
least  he  could  expect,  if  discovered,  was  soli- 
tarv  confinement. 

There  were  dreadful  weeks  of  waiting  to  be

endured  while  his  application  passed  from 
hand  to  hand.  He  knew  he  must  face  an  exami- 
nation from  the  Germans  that  would  sorely 
tax  his  limited  knowledge  of  surgery  and  medi- 
cal science.  But  whatever  the  possible  cost, 
escape  he  must  or  go  mad. 

In  the  twenty-sixth  month  of  his  imprison- 
ment, Chevalier  was  called  before  the  board 
of  German  Red  Cross  examiners.  He  felt  an 
antagonism  as  his  personal  inquisitor  eyed  him. 

"You  are  a  Red  Cross  man,  oui?"  the  Ger- 
man asked. 

"Oui,"  answered  Chevalier. 

"We  shall  see,"  the  German  said,  opening 
his  list  of  questions.  But  something  distracted 
his  attention,  what,  Chevalier  does  not  know 
to  this  day.  He  sat  absent-mindedly  fingering 
the  paper.  At  last,  his  gaze  returned  to  the 
boy  who  stood  before  him.  "Why  haven't  you 
moved  on?"  he  asked,  impatiently.  "You  have 
passed.  Next  man."  It  was  all  Chevalier  could 
do  to  control  a  shout  of  joy. 

Given  three  months  leave  of  absence  upon 
his  return  to  France  with  the  Red  Cross  con- 
tingent, Chevalier  sought  the  finest  available 
specialists.  X-ray  photographs  revealed  the 
position  of  the  shrapnel  near  his  heart.  One 
by  one  the  doctors  gravely  shook  their  heads 
and  refused  to  chance  an  operation.  It  was, 
they  said,  sure  death  at  this  late  date. 

Chevalier  offered  himself  again  for  active 
duty.  The  enemy,  he  thought,  might  as  well 
finish  the  job  they  had  begun.  But  the 
government  thought  otherwise.  A  medal  was 
pinned  on  him  and  he  was  sent  back  to  civilian 
life  with  an  honorable  discharge  as  unfit  for 
further  military  service. 

Shortly  after  his  discharge,  Chevalier's 
nerves   broke.      The   reaction   from   his   long 


strain  in  a  prison  camp  finally  made  itself  felt. 
The  break  came  while  on  a  theater  stage.  His 
vitality  failed  him  and  he  was  unable  to  finish 
the  performance. 

Again  he  made  the  round  of  doctors.  All 
prescribed  rest  and  quiet  in  retirement  if  he 
wished  to  live.  For  over  a  year  he  rested. 
But  while  he  won  back  strength,  he  did  not 
win  back  an  interest  in  life.  The  theater  had 
become  too  much  an  integral  part  of  his  exist- 
ence for  him  to  be  happy  away  from  it.  Dis- 
regarding the  doctors'  orders,  he  resumed  his 
career. 

It  wasn't  easy  at  first.  Fighting  giddiness, 
quick  fatigue,  the  constriction  of  his  lungs, 
he  wras  not  the  Chevalier  who  had  once  been 
the  idol  of  French  music-halls.  But  he  threw 
himself  into  his  work  with  the  intensity  of  a 
man  who  knows  how  good  it  is  to  work  again. 
Consequently  his  work  improved. 

He  taught  himself  the  trick  of  turning  on  and 
off  the  charm  which  had  once  been  sponta- 
neous. If  his  candle  was  burning  at  both  ends, 
he  wanted  it  to  give  the  brightest  light  pos- 
sible. Before  long  he  regained  the  hearts  of 
all  France.  Then  came  America  and  even 
greater  triumphs  in  motion  pictures. 

Perhaps  his  tremendous  popularity  has  be- 
come sweet  to  him  with  the  sweetness  of  a 
fleeting,  transitory  thing.  Perhaps  he  now 
seeks  to  conserve  all  the  energy  that  he  does 
not  have  to  lavish  in  public  appearances.  Per- 
haps living  eighteen  years  of  a  life  constantly 
menaced  by  sudden  death  has  made  him 
resigned  to  his  fate. 

"Since  the  war,  I  have  been  living  on 
borrowed  time.  Some  day  the  loan  will  be 
called.    Then — pouff!" 

And  there  you  have  it.

Later,  she  went  to  Europe.  She  returned 
with  her  hair  made  redder  and  instead  of  the 
gentle  curls,  she  wore  a  smart,  shorter  bob. 
She  came  back  with  a  determination,  too — a 
determination  that  she  would  not  play  any 
more  "typical  Janet  Gaynor  roles."  She  had 
taken  on  the  outward  indication  of  sophisti- 
cation, to  boot. 

What  happened  when  this  news  was  broad- 
cast to  the  world?  Hundreds  of  letters  pro- 
testing against  both  bob  and  sophistication 
came  to  Janet.  Janet  must  not  cut  her  curls, 
the  letters  begged.  Their  idol  of  "7th  Heaven" 
must  not  grow  sophisticated! 

A  trade  publication  took  a  poll  of  theater 
owners  throughout  the  United  States  to  dis- 
cover which  actor  or  actress  had  the  greatest 
individual  drawing  power.  Marie  Dressier 
was  first,  Janet  was  second.  But  it  was  the 
Janet  of  "Daddy  Long  Legs"  who  got  the 
votes. 

But  Janet  could  not  give  up  so  quickly  a 
desire  which  she  had  held  for  so  many  years 
and  which  had  already  cost  her  so  much 
money.  I'm  referring  to  her  long  hold-out 
when  she  went  to  Hawaii  and  was  off  salary. 

"Why  can't  I  be  different?  Why  can't  I 
prove  that  there's  something  in  me  besides 
'sugar  and  spice  and  everything  nice'?"  she 
wailed. 

In  the  meantime,  she  had  refused  to  do 
"Rebecca  of  Sunnybrook  Farm"  that  had 
been  purchased  for  her.  "Rebecca"  was  just 
the  sort  of  thing  she  meant — the  sort  of  thing 
she  most  of  all  did  not  want  to  do!  So,  to 
keep  her  happy,  she  was  given  "The  First 
Year,"  a  story  originally  intended  for  Sally 
Eilers  and  Jimrnie  Dunn,  and  Marian  Xixon 
was  handed  "Rebecca." 

What  followed  made  Janet  think — and  think 
hard.  Although  "Rebecca"  has  not  been 
released  long  enough  for  us  to  know  exactly 
how  it  rates,  it  seems  a  sure-fire  hit.  But 
that  wasn't  so  important  to  Janet  as  the  re- 


views concerning  Marian's  work.  Some  have 
claimed  her  the  equal  of  Janet,  others  said 
Marian  was  Janet's  superior. 

Sophistication  or  no  sophistication,  art  or 
no  art — that  was  a  pretty  bitter  pill,  for  if 
Janet  had  played  "Rebecca."  as  was  originally 
intended,  there  would  not  have  been  any 
drawing  of  comparisons.     And  she  knew  it! 

Other  things  caused  Janet  to  do  some 
thinking,  of  which  she  is  thoroughly  capable, 
I  can  tell  you!  There  is  Joan  Bennett.  It  is 
no  secret  that  Joan's  ambition  is  to  play 
Gaynor-type  roles  and  that  she  resents  being 
made  a  carbon  copy  of  her  sister,  Connie. 

pTrHEN  there  is  Sally  Eilers.  Janet  had  in- 
*■  sisted  upon  doing  "The  First  Year."  Might 
not  Sally  retaliate  by  taking  one  of  Janet's 
stories?  Sally  and  Jimrnie  Dunn  were  well 
toward  the  top  in  that  popularity  poll. 

In  the  meantime,  Lilian  Harvey  arrived 
from  Europe.  And  Janet  knew  that  when 
"Congress  Dances,"  a  foreign-made  picture 
with  Lilian,  was  released  the  critics  had  said, 
"Miss  Harvey  has  what  Janet  Gaynor  has — 
and  more!" 

So  that  was  the  set-up.  Remembering  the 
storm  of  protest  that  her  announcement  to  go 
semi-sophisticated  had  caused,  she  realized 
that  the  public  wanted  her  just  one  way  and 
no  other;  that  "they"  had  her  set  in  their 
minds  as  a  sweet,  fragile,  flower-like  creature; 
that  she  could  never,  so  long  as  she  looked 
as  she  did,  hope  to  be  different  on  the  screen. 

If  she  satisfied  herself  in  her  choice  of  screen 
material,  there  were  four  other  girls  ready  and 
willing  to  take  her  place.     So  what? 

So  what!  She  has  given  up  the  dream  of 
becoming  a  great  dramatic  actress.  She  has 
acceded  to  "their"  demands.  It's  sweet  little 
Diane  from  now  on. 

The  people's  choice — you'd  call  that.  Janet 
has  decided  at  last.  She  remains  upon  the 
screen  as  she  has  always  been!

SUCH  frivolities  of  fashion  as  ruffs,  bows 
and  ruchings  arc  busily  occupying  the 
thoughts  of  smart  Hollywood  these  days. 
RulTs  of  COque  feathers  are  one  of  the  newest 
rages.  Jean  Harlow  has  one  with  a  small 
feather  turban  to  match.  The  ruff  fastens 
with  a  huge  bow  of  green  velvet.  And  Con- 
stance Bennett  wears  a  collar  of  pink  coque 
feathers  on  a  negligee.  Velvet  and  organdie 
neck  fancies,  not  to  mention  good  old-fashioned 
ostrich  feather  boas,  are  making  their  appear- 
ances, too.  The  girls  are  going  very  giddy, 
indeed! 

"D  ED  seems  to  get  the  biggest  applause  in 
-'-^-colors.  You  see  it  in  all  shades.  Marlene 
Dietrich  prefers  a  dark  red.  She  appeared  on 
the  lot  the  other  day  wearing  a  very  tailored 
lightweight  wool  frock  in  this  shade.  And  a 
small  military  cape,  fitted  about  the  shoulders, 
tied  in  a  scarf  high  at  the  neckline. 

Lupe  Velez,  wouldn't  you  know,  likes  her 
reds  flaming!  She  strolled  into  the  studio  com- 
missary for  lunch  wearing  a  coat  with  matching 
fabric  hat  in  the  brightest  shade  she  could  find. 

Plaids  are  part  of  the  color  gaiety  and  style 
giddiness.  Anita  Loos,  the  writer,  wears  a 
bright  plaid  coat  and  hat.  Charlotte  Susa,  one 
of  the  more  recent  German  importations,  wears 
plaid  pajamas. 

ALTHOUGH  little  hats  are  the  general 
choice  of  the  stars,  some  very  wide 
brimmed  ones,  similar  to  those  known  years 
ago  as  "The  Merry  Widow,"  are  seen  at  after- 
noon affairs.     Carole  Lombard  wears  one  in 


brown.  Jean  Harlow  has  one  in  hatters'  plush. 
A  wdl-known  American  hat  designer  says  that 
the  very  large  brimmed  hats  are  for  you  who 
wish  to  look  unusually  distinguished. 

Adrian,  who  is  famous  for  the  stunning 
clothes  he  designs  for  Joan  Crawford,  proph- 
esies  that  draped  skirts  will  be  much  in  the 
fashion  picture  soon.  In  fact,  he  is  doing  a 
gown  with  one  for  "Rasputin." 

T_ TOSIF.K  Y  tends  toward  brown  or  tan  I 
-*-  -*-as  seen  about  Hollywood.  The  other  i  .  e 
ning  at  a  premiere,  Bette  Davis  wore  a 
dark  shade  of  sun  tan  with  a  brown  lace  dr<  -~ 
Darker  hose  in  very  sheer  weights  are 
everywhere. 

Norma  Shearer  wears  a  dark  brown  shade 
for  all  her  daytime  costumes.  Lilyan  Tash- 
man  wears  a  brown  stocking  with  gray 
costumes — this  brown  and  gray  alliance  is 
smartly  seen  in  costumes  and  accessories. 

TOAN  CRAWFORD  brought  back  the  most 
•^striking  evening  wrap  from  Europe.  Joan, 
you  know,  promised  herself  not  to  shop  abroad. 
She  says  she  practically  kept  her  promise 
because  she  only  brought  three  things  back 
with  her!  This  wrap  is  a  long  black  velvet 
coat  that  hangs  loosely  from  the  shoulders  to 
the  hem  of  her  gown.  It  has  no  ornamentation 
of  any  kind.  The  neckline  closes  right  at  the 
throat  and  the  shoulders  are  padded  to  give  a 
squarish  look.  It  is  the  robe  a  stage  tragedienne 
might  wear — Joan  makes  it  look  doubly 
dramatic  with  her  beautiful,  sad  face  rising 
above  it.

greatest  stress  was  laid  on  a  political  examina- 
tion with  the  screen  test  a  mere  formality. 

She  had  to  stand  before  a  board  of  stern  ex- 
aminers who  bombarded  her  with  such  ques- 
tions as,  "What  is  your  understanding  of  the 
Marxian  dialectic?" — the  type  of  question 
which  in  any  other  country  a  political  candi- 
date might  be  expected  to  answer,  but  surely 
not  a  movie  aspirant. 

T\  7IIATFVER  slips  Joan  made  were  excused 
W  on  the  basis  that  she  had  been  "con- 
taminated" by  living  in  a  capitalist  country. 
She  survived  the  ordeal  and  was  given  parts 
in  three  pictures. 

Joan  lived  well  here,  but  not  entirely  on  the 
salary  she  got  from  acting.  She  had  a  private 
income  from  the  Linked  States.  The  average 
salary  of  a  leading  actor  or  actress  varies  be- 
tween  three  hundred  to  five  hundred  rubles  a 
month. 

Tin's  (hey  get  whether  or  not  they  are  work- 
ing on  a  picture.  Translated  into  American 
money  this  would  mean  from  one  hundred 
fifty  to  two  hundred  fifty  dollars  a  month, 
but  this  won't  buy  nearly  as  much  in  Russia 
as  in  America. 

An  actress  cannot  afford  many  pairs  of  silk 
stockings  at  this  rate  when  their  price  in 
Moscow  is  thirty  rubles  a  pair,  or  a  small 
matter    of    fifteen    dollars.      Wither    can    she 


boast  of  a  sumptuous  home  with  beautiful 
green  lawns  and  a  marble  swimming  pool. 
Instead,  she  has  one  room  to  herself,  or.  if 
she  if  lucky,  a  two-room  apartment.  If  the 
room  brags  of  a  bath,  it  doesn't  mean  much 
bi  cause  it  has  to  be  shared  with  the  occupants 
of  about  live  other  rooms. 

After  her  breakfast  of  black  bread  and  tea, 
there  is  no  limousine  waiting  at  the  door  to 
rush  her  off  to  the  "kino  factory,"  as  the 
studio  is  known  here. 

She  has  to  push  her  way  on  a  street  car  which 
is  always  as  crowded  as  a  New  Vork  subway 
during  the  rush  hour,  or  a  truck  calls  for  her, 
which  has  already  picked  up  electricians] 
carpenters  and  extras.  She  gets  home  the 
same  way. 

TOURING  the  noon  hour  at  the  "factory." 
■^'everyone  piles  into  one  restaurant  and  dur- 
ing the  lunch  a  leading  actress  may  rub  elbows 
with  an  extra  with  the  grime  of  a  foundry 
still  on  his  hands,  for  everyone  eats  in  the  same 
place — directors,  actors,  prop-men  and  extras. 
The  kino  actress  doesn't  know  what  fan 
mail  means.  The  main  reason  is  that  she 
isn't  glorified  in  the  picture;  she  isn't  the  main 
figure  in  the  plot — the  director  sees  to  that. 
In  fact.  Pudovkin  prefers  to  pick  his  characters 
from  the  street,  rather  than  to  use  trained 
actors.     He  considers  that  the  latter  will  be

too  artificial  and  won't  portray  real  life  as  well 
as  the  man  who  has  just  come  out  of  it. 

This  kind  of  existence  would  be  considered 
pretty  tough  in  Hollywood,  but  the  Russian 
is  used  to  it. 

Besides,  they  vary  the  monotony  of  it  with 
occasional  parties.  They  may  not  be  as  swank 
as  Hollywood  parties,  but  the  guests  seem  to 
have  a  lot  of  fun. 

The  general  procedure  is  the  same  as  for  any 
Russian  party. 

FIRST  they  pick  out  the  person  with  the  big- 
gest room  and  make  him  host. 
The  guests  arrive  bearing  whatever  food  they 
could  forage  or  with  their  arms  laden  with 
various  bottles,  most  of  them  filled  with  vodka. 
Then  they  gather  in  one  room  and  toss  off 
vodka  in  astounding  quantities,  taking  a  few 
bites  of  food  between  each  gulp  to  quench 
that  burning  sensation  that  always  goes  with 
the  Russian  national  drink. 


These  parties  often  last  until  dawn,  but 
they  don't  cause  many  divorces. 

RUSSIAN  actresses  may  not  desert  their 
husbands  very  often,  but  they  sometimes 
desert  their  country.  Baclanova  was  once  a 
well-known  Sovietkino  actress.  She  went  to 
America  on  a  stage  tour,  saw  Hollywood  and 
has  never  returned  to  the  gold-domed  churches 
and  horse-drawn  droshkis  of  her  native  Mos- 
cow. 

Just  recently  Anna  Sten,  one  of  the  kino's 
shining  lights,  has  hit  the  Hollywood  trail. 
Her  fellow  actors  criticise  her  for  being  "un- 
Soviet." 

They  consider  that  she  yielded  to  the 
lure  of  fame,  fortune  and  fine  clothes,  in- 
stead of  devoting  herself  to  "the  Cause."  They 
feel  she  ought  to  return. 

But  once  she  sees  her  name  blazoned  in 
electric  lights,  on  Broadway,  what  do  you  think 
her  choice  will  be? 


Ricardo  Is  a  Riddle

tenderness.  Due  to  a  series  of  circumstances 
over  which  he  had  no  control,  he  was  forced 
to  adopt  this  armor  or  he  would  have  been 
trampled.  What  seems  like  indifference  is 
merely  compensation." 

Director  La  Cava  did  not  go  into  these 
circumstances.  But  we  know  them.  You 
know  them. 

CORTEZ  retreated  to  an  apartment  on  the 
top  floor  of  a  tall  Hollywood  building  and 
barricaded  himself  from  Hollywood  society. 
He  saw  only  a  few  intimates. 

He  retreated  from  public  life  except  for  his 
work  on  the  sets.  When  important  Hollywood 
folks  invited  this  handsome  unattached  man 
to  their  parties,  he  refused  to  attend.  He 
became  a  social  recluse;  a  Hollywood  hermit. 

It  can't  be  done. 

While  Ricardo  was  retreating,  Joel  McCrea 
was  advancing.  He.  was  being  seen  with 
Gloria  Swanson,  Connie  Bennett.  He  was 
building  his  reputation  as  a  man  who  could 
interest  women. 

All  male  screen  sensations  must  prove  that 
they    can    interest    women. 

And  escorting  Hollywood's  prominent  fem- 
inine stars  is,  naturally,  the  course  of  least 
resistance. 

Joel's  a  nice  lad.  He  has  no  complexes. 
He  admits  he's  lazy — that  he  follows  the 
course  of  least  resistance. 

Ricardo  could  never,  in  his  heart,  follow  the 
course  of  least  resistance.  He'd  have  to 
worry  and .  feel  deeply  about  everything  he 
does.  He'd  even  have  to  suffer  a  little  about 
it. 

Ricardo  is  never  a  nonchalant  person. 

But  Hollywood  calls  for  a  certain  amount  of 
nonchalance.  When  parties  are  given,  they 
like  to  have  handsome,  intriguing,  unmarried 
men  present.  -  ■  • 

These  men — as  partners  for .  the  world's 
most  beautiful  women — make  for  excitable 
entertainment. 

.  And  these  parties  give  handsome  actors  a 
chance  to  meet  the  producers  and  executives 
on  an  equal  footing- — become  social  brothers. 
The  actor  impresses  himself  on  the  con- 
sciousness of  the  producers  so,  when  a  picture 
is. to  be  cast,  they  cannot  help  but  remember 
him.  .  •>  

Tt's  just  good  fellowship  which  is  a  help 
in  any  business.  •    ,-.-..    .  i-„. 

Ricardo  has  not  established  that  feeling. 

Being  seen  with  such  women  as  Gloria 
Swanson  or  Connie  Bennett  makes  an  equal 
impression  upon  writers  and,  eventually,  the 
public. 

If  the  women  of  Hollywood  become  interested 
in  a  man,  it  is  inevitable  that  the  women  of 


the  country  will  believe  that  the  man  is 
worthy  of  their  interest. 

A  social  hermit  has  no  such  opportunity. 

Ricardo  is  beginning  to  realize  it.  He's 
even  verging  on  the  cynical  in  thinking  about 
it. 

"If  you  spend  fifteen  years  in  any  other 
business  and  tend  to  your  work,  you  can  expect 
to  be  a  junior  partner  or  even  a  senior  one. 
If  an  artist  paints  a  great  picture,  he  may  not 
get  recognition  while  he  lives,  but  his  work 
lives  on  and  inspires  after  he  is  gone.  The 
same  of  writing. 

"But  an  actor — he  is  so  soon  forgotten. 
He  does  a  good  piece  of  work  in  one  picture, 
and  if  he  doesn't  get  a  chance  in  another  good 
part  for  six  months,  he  is  forgotten.  The  only 
thing  he  has  is  money  and,  although  you 
can't  live  without  money,  it's  pretty  tough  to 
try  to  live  just  for  it. 

"I  don't  seem  to  be  able  to  flatter  people. 
I  couldn't  go  to  the  Olympics  day  in  and  day 
out  just  to  be  seen  there  because  it's  good 
publicity.  I  went  to  the  events  I  really  wanted 
to  see.  They  seemed  to  be  the  ones  which  the 
big  crowds  overlooked. 

"I  can't  sit  around  and  content  myself  with 
life  just  because  I'm  making  more  money  than 
the  ordinary  man  of  my  age. 

"And  I  can't  go  off  the  lot  in  make-up  and 
rush  to  the  Brown  Derby  for  luncheon  just 
to  sign  my  name  to  a  lot  of  autograph  books. 
I  have  always  removed  my  make-up  before 
I  left  the  lot  and  I  suppose  I  always  will.  I 
have  taken  the  picture  business  as  I  would 
any  other  business." 

"DUT  pictures  aren't  like  any  other  business! 
■^Picture  making  is  a  business  dealing  in  per- 
sonalities rather  than  pickles.  You  can  sell 
pickles  and  forget  them.  You  can't  do  that 
with  a  personality.  The  public  buys  the 
personalities  which  are  thrust  constantly 
before  them — which  they  are  forced  to  re- 
member. 

But  Ricardo's  beginning  to  emerge. 

This  cynicism  is  the  first  sign.  He's  analyz- 
ing- , 

Why,  he  even  admitted  to  me  that  he's  in 
love  with  a  blonde  non-professional.  And  for 
reticent  Ricardo  to  admit  love  is  the  healthiest 
of  signs.  .      . 

Another  director  who  knows  him  well  made 
this  remark:  -      ..... 

"When  he  finds  himself,  you'll  see  a  new 
personality,  even  on  .  the .  screen.  .One  for 
which  producers  will  be  hunting  madly  for 
stories.    He'll  be  a  sensation." 

If  he  finally  decides  to  shed  that  armor  he's 
wearing — watch  out.  There'll  be  a  feminine 
riot. 


Its  beauty  care 
for  your  hands 

"We  always  urge  women  who  do  their  own 
work  to  use  Lux  for  dishes  and  all  soap 
and  water  tasks.  Its  pure  suds  actually 
benefit  the  hands — never  leave  them  harsh 
and  dry  as  ordinary  soaps  often  do." 

Gladys  Perry 

Charles  of  the  Ritz—B.  Altman  &  Co. 


It  washes  the 
dishes  so  quickly' 

"No  more  dishwashing  drudgery  for  me 
now  that  I'm  using  Lux.  It  dissolves  so 
much  faster  than  ordinary  bar  soaps  or 
chips,  and  has  such  beautiful  lasting  suds 
that  dishes  and  glasses  are  sparkling  with- 
out any  effort.  It  washes  so  quickly!"       . 

Mrs.  M.  Marvin  Wright 

Millions  of  women — and  beauty 
experts  everywhere — are  enthusiastic 
about  Lux  for  dishes.  It's  so  quick. 
And  it's  so  marvelous  for  the  hands. 
Ordinary  soaps  too  often  contain 
harmful  alkali  which  dries  the  skin, 
leaves  it  coarse  and  rough.  Lux  has  no 
harmful  alkali — that's  why  it  leaves  the 
hands  so  soft  and  fastidiously  white.

BREACH  OF  PROMISE— World  Wide 

IT  will  take  more  than  the  good  performances 
of  Mae  Clarke  and  Chester  Morris  to  lift 
this  story  from  the  ordinary.  A  small  town 
kitchen  slavey  learns  about  breach  of  promise 
from  her  city  girl  friend.  She  tries  it  out  on 
the  town's  shining  hope  for  state  senator. 
Becoming  remorseful  over  ruining  his  career, 
she  confesses  perjury  and  takes  her  punish- 
ment.    Not  good,  not  bad. 


THE  GIRL  FROM  CALGARY— 
First  Division-Monogram 

ANOTHER  little  girl  from  the  wide  open 
spaces  wins  an  Atlantic  City  (is  that  all 
I  they  do  in  that  town?)  beauty  contest,  gets 
a  coveted  spot  in  the  Follies,  falls  into  the 
naughty  hands  of  a  designing  millionaire,  but 
is  saved  by  her  honest  press-agent.  Fifi 
Dorsay  is  cute  and  plump  as  the  girl.  Paul 
Kelly,  making  a  comeback,  plays  opposite. 
Interesting,  despite  the  aged  plot. 

OUTLAW  JUSTICE— Majestic  Pictures 

THIS  Western  is  just  a  little  different.  Of 
course,  hero  Jack  Hoxie  saves  girl-friend 
Dorothy  Gulliver  from  danger,  but  the 
scenario  writer  let  him  do  it  in  a  unique  man- 
ner. Although  there's  plenty  of  gorgeous 
scenery,  the  action  is  not  sacrificed  to  it. 
There  is  lots  of  excitement. 


A  PARISIAN  ROMANCE— 
Allied  Pictures 

LEW  CODY,  Marion  Shilling,  Gilbert  Ro- 
land, Joyce  Compton,  Yola  D'Avril,  Helen 
Jerome  Eddy  and  Bryant  Washburn!  Such  a 
cast  gives  any  picture,  even  one  with  a  story 
as  dull  as  this,  some  interest.  Cody  is  a 
roue;  Roland  an  artist  and  Marion  Shilling 
the  girl  who  causes  the  complications.  You 
get  your  money's  worth  watching  those  com- 
petent troupers  try  to  steal  scenes  from  each 
other. 

ALIAS  MARY  SMITH— 
May/air  Pictures 

THIS  one  looks  as  if  somebody  took  ten 
minutes  off  on  a  busy  day  and  decided  to 
write  a  scenario.  Many  favorites  are  in  the 
cast,  including  John  Darrow.  Gwen  Lee, 
Raymond  Hatton,  Henry  B.  Walthall,  Alec 
B.  Francis,  Edmund  Breese,  Blanche  Mehaffey 
and  Myrtle  Stedman. 

KLONDIKE— Monogram 

OLD  mellerdrama  of  the  silent  days,  made 
into  a  talkie.  And  it  limps  from  sheer 
old  age.  Yillains  are  villains,  virtue  gets  re- 
warded, and  the  hero  is  pretty  good.  Lyle 
Talbot  does  as  well  as  he  can  with  this  picture, 
but  Thelma  Todd  is  unfortunately  cast  as 
the  sweet  young  thing.

OUT  OF  SINGAPORE— 
Goldsmith  Prod. 


BACK  in  the  old,  old  days — long  before 
talkies — you  probably  got  a  thrill  out  of 
pictures  like  this.  It's  about  a  villain  who 
shanghais  sailors,  sinks  ships,  attacks  innocent 
daughters  of  kind  sea-captains  and  commits 
unnecessary  murders.  Noah  Beery,  Dorothy 
Burgess  and  Miriam  Seegar  try  hard,  but 
can't  do  much  with  the  material  at  hand. 

THE  LAST  MAN— Columbia 

A  SHIP  floats  at  sea  like  a  derelict,  yet 
when  a  boat  overtakes  it,  all  hands  are 
found  dead  except  a  crazed  old  man,  a  girl  and 
a  tough  young  seaman.  Charles  Bickford,  as 
the  last  man,  recounts  a  lurid  tale  of  mutiny 
at  sea.  Dramatic  moments  and  good  acting, 
but  the  story  drags.  Constance  Cummings  is 
charming. 

STRANGE  JUSTICE— RKO-Radio 

TOO  bad.  Here's  excellent  directing  and 
actors  who  cannot  be  bettered.  Richard 
Bennett,  Norman  Foster,  Marian  Marsh  (who 
does  her  best  to  date),  Reginald  Denny  and 
Irving  Pichel.  Yet  the  story  is  over-dramatic 
and  never  once  rings  true.  It's  about  a 
Broadway  play  boy,  a  hat  check  girl  and  a 
chauffeur. 

THE  BIG  STAMPEDE— Warners 

CATTLE  rustlers,  deputy  sheriffs,  brave 
heroes  and  all  the  other  typical  Western 
characters  are  so  well  played  that  this  is  a 
better-than-average  movie  of  this  type.  John 
Wayne,  Noah  Beery  and  Luis  Alberni  are  in 
the  cast. 

EXPOSURE— Tower  Prod. 

A  GOOD  cast.  Lila  Lee,  Walter  Byron, 
Tully  Marshall,  Mary  Doran,  Bryant 
Washburn,  Pat  O'Malley.  But  a  weak  story. 
This  lags  way  behind  those  top-notch  column- 
ist stories  that  you  have  been  seeing.  The 
peep-hole  writer  builds  his  newspaper  circu- 
lation on  scandal  and  then  tosses  it  all  over 
to  save  the  family  of  his  deadliest  enemy  from 
disgrace. 

MAEDCHEN  IN  UNIFORM— 
Carl  Froelich  Prod. 

HTHIS  German  language  film  (with  English 
■*■  subtitles)  was  acclaimed  in  Europe.  And 
with  reason.  A  moving  and  sensitive  story 
about  a  fourteen-year-old  girl  who  enters  a 
school  for  daughters  of  officers,  and  the  effect 
of  the  rigid  discipline  and  repression  on  her 
emotional  life.  As  the  one  understanding 
and  loving  teacher,  Dorothea  Wieck  gives  a 
tender  and  beautiful  performance,  and  the 
direction  by  Leontine  Sagan  is  flawless. 

PHANTOM  EXPRESS— Majestic 

~K  A  YSTERY  thrillers  are  riding  the  rails  now! 
■*■  *  *-A  railroad  is  being  forced  to  sell  out  to  a 
syndicate  because  four  of  its  crack  trains  have 
been  mysteriously  wrecked  by  a  "Phantom" 
train  speeding  toward  them  in  the  dark.  Old 
time  melodrama,  but  exciting.  Buster  Collier, 
Sally  Blane  and  J.  Farrell  MacDonald  try  hard 
to  make  the  story  convincing.

FAT  GIRLS  Winners  of  Photoplay's 

Second  Treasure  Hunt 


NEVER  WIN  THE 

MEN  THEY  LOVE! 


Fat  women  must  take  "the  leavings" 
when  it  comes  to  choosing  sweet- 
hearts and  husbands.  After  all,  you 
can't  blame  any  man  for  prefering  a 
winsome,  slender  girl! 

Start  to-day  and  set  rid  of  ugly  fat  —  the  SAFE  way 
— the  HEALTHY  way  with  a  half  teaspoonful  of  Kius- 
chen  Salts  in  a  glass  of  hot  water  every  morning  before 
breakfast.  Kruschen  is  a  splendid  blend  of  6  SEPARATE 
minerals  which  help  every  gland  and  body  organ  to 
function  properly  and  throw  off  poisons  and  waste 
accumulations. 

Surplus  fat  gradually  leaves  until  weight  is  restored  to 
NORMAL.  And  what  glorious  good  health  you'll 
enjoy — more  energy  ,too.  Many  women  hasten  results 
by  going  lighter  on  potatoes,  pastries  and  fatty  meats. 

Mrs.  J.  Cipe  of  Willow  Hill,  Pa.  reduced  A3  lbs.  in 
3  months  with  Kruschen — she's  overjoyed !

nounced in  the  August  issue.  The  first, 
in  the  April  issue,  introduced  PHOTOPLAY 
readers  to  this  interesting  contest,  and 
brought  such  a  tremendous  response  from 
all  parts  of  the  United  States  and  from 
foreign  countries,  too,  that  the  judges  had 
quite  a  task  in  reading  and  sorting  all  the 
solutions,  and  selecting  the  winners. 

And  the  response  in  the  second  contest 
was  even  greater.     Within  a  few  days

after  the  August  issue  of  Photoplay  was 
placed  in  the  mails  and  put  on  sale  at

stream  right  up  to  the  deadline,  midnight 
September  5. 

Remembering  their  experience  in  the 
first  contest,  the  judges  were  ready  for

Short   Subjects 
of  the  Month 


We've  shown  you  photos  of  so  many  human  com- 
edians that  we  thought  it  about  time  a  couple  of  grand 
actors  like  these  two  got  a  break.  These  fellows  — 
you  recognize  your  old  friend  Pete  —  do  a  lot  to  make 
Hal    Roach's   "Our    Gang"   comedies    entertaining 


COUNTY  HOSPITAL 
Hal  Roach  Comedy 
"You  bring  me  hard  boiled  eggs  and  nuts!" 
accuses  Mr.  Hardy  as  his  broken  leg  swings  in 
a  cast  above  the  hospital  bed.  Mr.  Laurel 
looks  abashed  while  he  eats  his  sickbed  offering 
and  plucks  at  the  counterpane.  Another  goofy 
comedy  by  this  mad  team  with  a  hair-raising 
ride  as  climax. 

SEEING  THE  U.  S.  BY  ST  A  TES 
Picture  Classics 
This  is  the  first  of  a  series  of  short  subjects 
which  should  be  grand  entertainment  as  well 
as  educational.  Instead  of  taking  a  camera 
journey  to  foreign  shores,  you  are  introduced 
to  the  United  States.  This  one,  about  Georgia, 
shows  big  cities  as  well  as  small  towns.  Watch 
for  these  novelties — they're  good. 

THE  BIRD  STORE 

Silly  Symphony-Columbia 
Such  twitterings  and  tweetings  as  go  on  in 
this  gay  bird  store  of  Walt  Disney's!  There's 
a  strong  social  line  drawn  between  the  differ- 
ently priced  birds,  too.  But  all  unite  to  save 
one  small  straying  bird  from  the  claws  of  a 
marauding  cat.    Rollicking  tunes. 

BRING  'EM  BACK  HALF  SHOT 
RKO-Radio 
The  animated  cartoonist  has  turned  in  a 
very  funny  travesty  on  Frank  Buck's  famous 
"Bring  'Em  Back  Alive."  You'll  get  a  real 
chuckle  out  of  this  one,  which  opens  up  a  whole 
new  field  for  the  pen  and  ink  comedies. 

MICKETS  REVUE 

Walt  Disney-Columbia 
Mickey's  giving  a  small  town  musical  revue 
this  time — and  don't  miss  it!  Musical  instru- 
ments range  from  ash  cans  to  wash  tubs — and 
the  syncopation,  is  it  hot!  We  don't  have  to 
tell  you  that  it's  fun. 


THE  TRA  NS-A  TLA  NTIC 
MYSTERY 

Yitaphone 
Another  of  those  exceptionally  well  done  and 
complicated  short  mystery  dramas  of  S.  S.  Van 
Dine  in  which  two  murders  take  place  on  board 
a  ship  which  also  carries  a  gang  of  jewel 
thieves.  This  is  worth  fifteen  minutes  of  any- 
body's time. 

NIAGARA  FALLS 
RKO-Pathe 
June  McCloy's  nice,  huskily  sung  ditties 
save  this  from  being  just  another  comedy.  The 
good  old  plot  of  three  girls  trying  to  evade  the 
irate  landlady  while  they  find  work,  is  dusted 
off  again.  Gertrude  Short  and  Marion  Shilling 
complete  the  trio.    Only  mildly  amusing. 

WAR  BABIES 
Educational 
The  first  of  a  series  of  miniature  burlesques 
in  which  the  child  actors  take  the  adult 
troupers  for  a  comedy  ride.  This  one  is  a 
travesty  on  the  "Cock-eyed  World"  type  of 
picture  and  is  a  sprightly  little  piece.  Grow-n- 
ups  will  like  it  as  well  as  kids. 

TEE  FOR  TWO 

Vitaphone 
Unlike  so  many  of  the  musical  shorts,  this 
has  a  bit  of  comedy  plot  with  Franklin  Pang- 
born  indulging  in  his  usual  side-splitting  antics 
— this  time  on  a  golf  course.  The  singing  and 
dancing  is  good,  too.  Plenty  of  entertainment 
here. 

BERLIN  TODAY 

Vitaphone 
If  you  want  to  know  how  German  police 
dogs  are  trained,  here's  your  chance — but  don't 
expect  your  own  Rover  to  behave  so  well  as 
these  fellows.  This  is  an  entertaining  ten 
minutes  that  takes  you  through  the  German 
metropolis. 


I  Was  Ashamed 

of  My  Poor 

Hands 

.  .  So  Chapped  .  . 
Rough  and  Ugly 


Everything  Failed 
Until  I  Discovered  This 

Utterly  New 
Type  Lotion 

"T  WAS  embarrassed  to  death  when  anyone 

J.  glanced  at  my    miserable-looking   hands. 
But  how  proudly  I  show  them  now!" 

Your  hands  can  be  lovelier,  too,  if  you  use 
this  new  kind  of  lotion — so  different  from  ordi- 
nary  preparations.  Called  Chamberlain's  Lotion, 
it  contains  13  different,  imported  oils,  each  for 
a  specific  purpose  One  clears  and  whitens  red, 
discolored  hands — removes  even  fruit,  vege- 
table, nicotine  stains.  Another,  antiseptic, 
brings  quick,  soothing  relief  from  chap,  sore- 
ness, windburn  and  annoying  skin  irritations. 
Still  another  refines  coarse  pores,  revives  dried- 
out  skin  (the  forerunner  of  wrinkles,  lines),  and 
softens  skin  texture  so  wonderfully  even 
callouses  disappear.  The  most  abused  hands 
become  revitalized  and  naturally  lovelier — 
velvety-smooth  and  years  younger-looking. 

Tests  prove  Chamberlain's  Lotion  is  ab- 
sorbed in  37  seconds!  No  waiting  to  dry — no 
stickiness— no  bothersome  mas- 
sage of  gummy  lotions  that  must 
be  rubbed  in. 

Try  Chamberlain's  Lotion. 
Prove  in  7  days  you  can  gain 
appealingly  soft,  white  hands — 
recapture  youthful  skin  bloom 
— or  money  back.  Ideal  as  a 
powder  base.  Delightfully  fra- 
grant. Two  sizes  — at  all  drug 
and  department  stores.

Master's  Touch 
MAKES  it  a 
COCKTAIL 

HELP  yourself  to  a  long  drink 
of  original  College  Inn 
Tomato  Cocktail.  Taste  it — then 
you'll  know  why  it's  called  tomato 
cocktail — more  than  mere  tomato 
juice.  It's  carefully,  delicately 
seasoned  to  provide  a  flavor  un- 
matched, unequalled  anywhere. 
There's  no  more  reason  to  drink 
unseasoned  tomato  juice  than  to 
eat  unseasoned  salads  or  meats. 

Only  College  Inn  gives  you  mas- 
terful tomato  cocktail  blending — 
all  the  glory  of  whole  tomatoes 
plus  the  Master's  touch. 

Insist  upon  Original  College  Inn 
Tomato  Cocktail  and  you'll  enjoy 
a  better  tomato  drink.

But  because  I  was  fortunate  enough  to  shape 
my  life  so  that  I  could  use  one  of  the  talents, 
one  of  the  gifts,  which  had  come  to  me  from — 
I  don't  know  where,  but  from  some  great  power 
outside  myself. 

We  all  have  those  gifts.  They  are  that 
divine  heritage  of  which  we  must  be  conscious. 
Only  we  musn't  be  so  lazy  about  it.  We  must 
use  it,  dig  it  out,  think  it  out. 

T  BELIEVE  sincerely  and  completely  that 
-*■  your  body  is  the  instrument  of  your  mind, 
and  that  your  life  is  the  instrument  of  your 
soul.  Use  them — don't  let  them  use  you.  Get 
to  work.  Make  your  body  do  what  you  want 
it  to  do  and  your  life  be  what  you  want  it  to 
be.  The  divine  gift  is  there,  but  it's  no  more 
use  if  you  don't  use  it  than  a  bottle  of  per- 
fume you  got  for  Christmas  if  you  don't 
open  it. 

The  glorious  doors  of  the  past,  always  open 
to  us  through  books,  prove  that  at  least  half 
the  really  great  men  of  this  world  were  born  in 
poverty,  grew  up  without  education  or  train- 
ing. Charles  Dickens  was  an  abjectly  poor  boy. 
But  he  used  his  genius  to  make  life  easier  for 
other  children. 

Abraham  Lincoln  grew  up  in  dire  and  tragic 
circumstances,  but  he  used  his  gifts  and  he 
made  his  homeliness  beloved. 

To  me,  the  essential  thing  with  youth  is  to 
be  ready — but  never  to  force.  To  set  a  good 
example,  without  talking  too  much  about  it. 
To  prove  by  your  own  living  that  the  things 
you  tell  them  bring  happiness.  The  desire  of 
all  young  hearts  is  for  happiness — for  love — 
for  joy.  All  other  traits  are  educated,  are  the 
result  of  development.  If  a  child  sees  that 
those  about  him  are  not  happy,  that  they 
don't  bring  happiness  into  the  lives  of  others, 
then  he's  bound  to  think  that  he  doesn't  par- 
ticularly want  to  follow  their  theories.  That 
makes  sense,  doesn't  it? 

Leave  children  free  to  choose  for  themselves. 
God  made  us  the  gift  of  free  will — of  choice. 
Why  can't  we  pass  that  on  to  our  children? 
Let  them  choose  their  own  work,  their  own 
mates.  They'll  come  out  all  right.  They  have 
a  divine  instinct  which  will  guide  andhelp  them. 
And  often  pressure  put  upon  them  forces  them 
to  demonstrate  their  own  independence  by  do- 
ing something  that  they  don't  want  to  do  at  all. 

Make  them  love  you — and  through  that 
love  accept  such  help  as  you  can  give  them. 
And  show  them  early  that  self-discipline  is  a 
magnificent  help  in  getting  what  you  want 
from  life.  Self-control  is  essential  to  achieve- 
ment— and  they'll  soon  see  it. 

You  may  think  that  I  am  speaking  without 
the  experience  of  motherhood,  but  you  will  be 
wrong.  Physical  motherhood  isn't  the  only 
one  by  a  long  ways.  I  sometimes  wonder  if 
God  fails  to  send  children  to  some  women  so 
that  they  may  be  free  to  mother  the  mother- 
less. It  has  been  a  great  blessing  to  me— the 
opportunity  to  mother  those  who  needed  it 
and  didn't  have  it.  You'd  be  surprised  how 
many  grown-ups  still  need  mothering.  It  has 
been  my  great  compensation. 

COMPEXSATIOX  is  one  of  the  things  we 
learn  about  as  we  grow  older  and  about 
which  youth  knows  nothing.  The  eternal  and 
beautiful  law  of  compensation.  The  fullness  of 
life  that  gives  so  liberally  that  even  when  we 
lose  or  are  denied  things,  there  are  other  things 
to  take  their  place. 

But.  as  there  is  nothing  unforgivable  to 
youth,  there  is  much  that  is  unforgivable  to  us 
older  ones.  Experience  has  taught  us.  Life 
has  shown  us  the  way.  We  have  had  a  chance 
to  get  our  sense  of  values  and  to  know  what 
life  means.  It  is  an  obligation  upon  us  to  be 
gracious,  to  be  serene,  to  be  joyous.    It  is  an 


obligation  upon  us  to  use  the  results  of  all  that 
we  have  gone  through. 

As  I  drove  to  the  studio  the  other  morning, 
I  made  an  attempt  to  straighten  out  definitely 
in  my  mind  the  things  that  I  admire  and  the 
things  that  are  worth  while  in  people — for 
people  are  after  all  the  most  important  thing  in 
life  to  those  of  us  who  live  in  the  world. 

There  are  so  many  things  which  the  world 
thinks  important,  which  do  not  seem  so  to  me 
any  more. 

And  it  has  been  said  often  that  a  chain  is 
only  as  strong  as  its  weakest  link.  But  I  have 
made  up  my  mind  that  sometimes  it  is  as 
strong  as  its  strongest  link.  A  person  may 
measure  up  to  the  finest  thing  in  him  as  often 
as  he  falls  to  the  lowest  thing  in  him.  It  is  our 
business  always  to  see  and  to  expect  that  it  is 
the  strongest  link  which  will  hold  and  not  the 
weakest  link  which  will  break. 

The  attribute  of  human  nature  that  I  admire 
most  is  kindliness. 

("^H,  what  a  lot  of  things  rush  into  my  head 
^'under  that  one  word. 

Kindliness  and  what  it  means.  To  cheer 
others  on  their  way.  To  overlook  faults.  To 
put  aside  prejudices.  To  remember  always  to 
give  real  appreciation  and  real  praise  where 
and  when  it  is  due.  To  protect  others  frcm 
humiliation.  To  meet  all  without  jealousy  or 
envy  or  rancor.  To  think  and  expect  the  best 
of  everyone. 

Kindliness — which  will  make  beautiful  even 
needed  rebuke,  which  will  enable  you  to  stand 
for  principle  when  you  need  to  do  so  without 
hurting  anyone. 

The  kindliness  which  is  courtesy  and  which 
makes  the  world  such  a  pleasant  place  to 
live  in. 

Do  you  know  what  is  my  greatest  pleasure 
in  life?  To  know  that  I  am  loved  by  those 
with  whom  I  come  in  daily  contact.  To  walk 
around  my  studio  lots  and  to  be  met  with 
smiles.  To  see  faces  light  up  when  I  pass.  To 
feel  that  when  I  come  on  the  set  they  are  all 
glad  to  see  me.  To  be  given  each  day  the 
courtesy  and  affection  of  those  I  meet. 

I  may  say  all  that  without  vanity,  because 
I  tell  you  that  my  gratitude  for  it  is  deep  and 
humble.  It  is  a  gift  to  me  from  love.  And  my 
heart  is  filled  with  appreciation  for  it. 

There  is  nothing  from  my  long  experience 
which  I  can  pass  on  to  you  today  that  is  more 
valuable  than  to  tell  you  how  wonderful  it  is  to 
have  those  about  you  fond  of  you  and  loyal  to 
you  and  glad  to  be  with  you.  Nothing.  Xo 
investment  you  can  make,  no  success,  no 
worldly  place  nor  any  of  the  things  that  money 
can  buy  you  will  give  you  the  real  joy  of  living 
that  comes  from  being  loved. 

And  nothing  will  so  lift  the  world  above 
darkness  and  despair,  nothing  will  leaven  the 
lump  and  bring  gladness,  as  will  ordinary, 
everyday  kindliness,  to  be  shared  by  all.  If 
we  all  began  just  to  be  kind,  to  speak  kindly, 
to  think  kindly — why,  it  would  be  like  the 
coming  of  spring  to  a  garden.  What  that 
would  do  for  the  world! 

NEXT,  come  loyalty  and  courage.  For 
strangely  enough,  neither  is  worth  much 
without  the  other. 

Those  are  the  aggressive  characteristics  of 
life.  Courage  to  face  all  things  without  falter- 
ing and  to  know  that  you  can  get  up  on  your 
feet,  maybe  with  your  knees  scarred,  but  with 
your  ability  to  walk  intact.  Courage  not  to 
sell  out,  not  to  prostitute  yourself  nor  your 
talents. 

You  all  know  what  loyalty  is  and  how  im- 
portant it  is  to  a  fine  character.  You  cannot 
know  love  nor  friendship,  those  two  great  gifts, 
unless  you  yourself  possess  loyalty. 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  November,  1932 


And  tolerance.  Down  through  the  ages,  in- 
tolerance has  been  the  curse  of  mankind.  It 
has  wrecked  kingdoms,  cost  lives,  prevented 
progress.  It  destroys  peace  and  happiness 
everywhere  it  touches. 

Yet  it  goes  on.  We  say,  "  If  you  don't  think 
as  I  do,  you  must  be  wrong.  If  you  don't  be- 
lieve as  I  do,  I  will  punish  you  if  I  can.  All 
that  is  right  is  contained  in  and  included  in 
what  I  think— and  if  you  disagree  with  me 
I  will  use  force,  if  I  can,  to  make  you  conform 
to  my  beliefs." 

Tolerance  includes  understanding.  For  if 
you  understand  all  people,  you  will  be  tolerant 
of  them.  How  little  we  know  about  those  we 
criticize. 

How  little  we  understand  about  what  has 
made  a  man  or  woman  what  they  are,  about  the 
forces  that  have  beaten  upon  them,  about  the 
temptations  that  have  beset  them. 

If  we  understand,  if  we  can  get  into  the  other 
fellow's  shoes  mentally,  we  will  always  be 
tolerant. 

The  older  I  grow,  the  more  I  find  that  the 
thing  I  dislike  most,  and  of  which  it  is  most 
difficult  for  me  to  be  tolerant,  is  pretense. 

Pretense  is  silly  and  useless  and  tiresome. 

I  have  never  known  a  pretentious  person 
who  was  attractive. 

T^ONT  pretend.  Be  yourself — in  everything. 
-*-' And  if  you  don't  like  that  self,  improve  it. 
But  don't  pretend  to  be  what  you're  not,  to 
know  what  you  don't,  to  believe  what  you 
don't  understand.  Pretense  robs  us  of  the  op- 
portunity to  learn. 

Yes,  life  is  a  grand  adventure.  The  days  are 
full  of  new  things  to  learn,  of  books  to  read,  of 
friends  to  love,  of  a  chance  to  get  closer  to  God. 

I  have  been  sad.  I  have  been  wounded. 
.1  have  been  defeated. 

But  I  thank  God  with  all  my  heart  that  I 
have  never  been  bored.  I  have  always  wanted 
to  see  the  next  sunrise.  I  have  always  been 
glad  of  the  chance  to  live — of  that  great, 
supreme  gift  of  living,  of  being  part  of  the 
game,  of  being  in  the  forefront  of  the  battle 
even  when  I  was  losing  it.

Greetings,  little  Renee,  you've  been 
away  from  the  screen  much  too  long. 
Hollywood  welcomed  Renee  Adoree 
with  open  arms — and  large  bunches 
of  flowers — when  she  returned  from

Her  Nervous  Prostration 


DO  you  know  her  .  .  .  this  poor 
woman  who  wakes  up  as  tired  as 
she  went  to  bed? 

Her  head  is  still  aching  .  .  .  her  nerves 
are  ragged  .  .  .  she's  on  the  verge  of  tears 
as  she  faces  another  day  of  work. 

How  many  young  women  are  fast  ap- 
proaching a  nervous  breakdown  because 
they  let  suffering  due  to  female  weakness 
rob  them  of  their  strength  and  health. 

Nature  did  not  mean  women  to  suffer 


so  cruelly.  If  they  would  only  try  Lydia  E. 
Pinkham's  Vegetable  Compound!  It  has 
befriended  women  against  their  "pecu- 
liar" troubles  for  over  50  years. 

It  brings  soothing,  comforting  relief

ening tonic  action.

15  Years  Ago 


you  remember  Irene 
Castle?  Sure,  you  do,  but 
maybe  what  you  have  forgotten 
is  that  it  was  Irene  who  in- 
troduced bobbed  hair — in  those 
days  called  the  Castle  clip.  And 
fifteen  years  ago  she  was  such  an 
important  screen  star  that 
PHOTOPLAY  gave  her  a  story  that 
covered  three  pages.  Sow,  re- 
tired from  the  screen,  she  spends 
her  time  gathering  up  homeless 
dogs  and  cats  and  providing  for  Irene 

them  right  royally.  Castle 

My,  my,  how  times  change. 
Here's  a  page  of  pictures,  one  showing  the  home 
life  of  Mary  Pickford  and  Owen  Moore, 
and  another  of  Mae  Murray  and  her  director, 
Bob  Leonard,  who  was  soon  to  become  her 
husband.  But  here's  one  thing  that  doesn't 
change.  Frances  Marion,  the  scenario  writing 
dynamo,  was  known  then  as  "the  highest 
paid  woman  scenarist  in  pictures."  She  is  still 
that  and  still  turning  out  grand  film  stories. 


One  of  the  biggest  stars  of  the 
day  was  William  Farnum.   "The 
Spoilers"  had  set  him  on  top  and 
he  was  still  there.     But  during 
the  years  Bill  was  forgotten.    He 
has  just  been   re-discovered   by 
his  friend  Doug  Fairbanks,  and 
you'll  catch  an  interesting 
glimpse  of  him  in   Doug's  new 
picture,  "  Mr.  Robinson  Crusoe." 
Mae  Murray  was  the  girl  on 
the  cover,  and  those  who  graced 
the   gallery   were    Mary    Fuller, 
Mabel  Taliaferro,  Virginia  Pear- 
son and  Anna  Q.  Nilsson. 
In  the  "Shadow  Stage''  department  some  of 
the   pictures   reviewed    were    "Jack   and    the 
Beanstalk."  Norma  Talmadge  in  "The  Moth." 
Florence    LaBadie    in    "War    and    Women." 
Duslin  Farnum  in  "The  Spy"  and  Doug  Fair- 
banks in  "Down  to  Earth." 

Cal  York  item:  Marion  Davies,  musical 
comedy  star,  makes  her  motion  picture  debut 
in  "Runaway  Romany." 


10  Years  Ago 


HTEN  years  ago  we  asked  the 
*■  question,  "Who  Is  the  Most 
Popular  Girl  in  Hollywood,"  and 
then  answered — "Bebe  Daniels," 
going  on  to  point  out  that  not 
only  was  she  the  most  sought 
after  of  her  own  social  set.  but 
she  was  head  girl  with  every 
studio  worker,  as  well.  That 
was  ten  years  ago  and  yet  I  be- 
lieve that  if  a  popularity  vote 
were  taken  today,  Bebe's  name 
would  still  be  close  to  the  top. 
Her  Sunday  buffet  suppers  draw 
hundreds  of  filmdom's  notables. 
Bebe  was  beaued  around  by  a  score  or  more  of 
young  men,  and  now,  as  Mrs.  Ben  Lyon,  she 
is  one  of  Hollywood's  favorite  hostesses. 

We  ran  a  couple  of  pages  of  pictures  of  film 
couples  who  were  "keeping  steady  company." 
Of  the  five  couples  only  two  married  each 
other.  Colleen  Moore  and  John  McCormick, 
Helen  Ferguson  and  William  Russell,  did— but 
Betty  Compson  and  Walter  Morosco,  Eddie 
Sutherland  and  May  McAvoy,  Bebe  Daniels 
and  Harold  Lloyd,  didn't.     They  all  married 


somebody  else.    New  Hollywood 
romances  flourish   every  day. 
By  far   the   most   sensational 
star  was  Pola  Negri,  and  those 
that  say  Garbo  started  the  vogue 
for  glamour  are  wrong.    Pola  was 
one  of  the  first  foreign  stars.   She 
put  on  an  act  that  would  make 
Garbo  blush  for  shame.    She  had 
Hollywood  as  much  on  its  ear  ten 
years  ago  as  Garbo  has  today. 
Colleen  Moore  appeared  on  the 
Bebe  cover,  while  lovely  Barbara  La- 

Daniels  Marr,  Anna  Q.  Nilsson,  Gloria 

Swanson,  Jack  Holt,  Milton  Sills, 
Norma  Talmadge  and  Lila  Lee  were  in  the  gal- 
lery. 

The  six  best  pictures  were  "Timothy's 
Quest,"  "Love  Is  an  Awful  Thing,"  "Remem- 
brance." Marion  Davies  in  "When  Knighthood 
Was  in  Flower,"  Lew  Cody  in  "The  Valley  of 
Silent  Men,"  and  Leatrice  Joy  in  "Man- 
slaughter." 

Cal  York  items:  Mabel  Normand  returned 
from  Paris  with  a  lot  of  new  frocks.  .  .  .  Bill 
Hart  is  the  father  of  a  nine-pound  boy. 


5  Years  Ago 


LADY    DAINTY    CO.,  Main   St.,   Peru,  Ind. 


FIVE  years  ago  the  fad  was 
youth,  the  cry  of  the  producers 
was  for  youth — just  as  today 
glamour  is  the  word.  Charming 
young  faces  were  being  snapped 
up  by  all  the  studios,  and  among 
those  for  whom  we  predicted 
sensational  futures  were  Charlie 
Farrell,  Janet  Gaynor,  Buddy 
Rogers,  Dolores  Del  Rio,  Gary 
Cooper,  Thelma  Todd  and  Dick 
Arlen.  Those  were  pretty  good 
prophecies,  yes? 

The  most  vivid  personality  of 
five  years  ago  was  Maria  Corda, 
the  Hungarian  beauty  who  created  such  a  stir 
in  "Helen  of  Troy.''  She  had  her  little  day 
of  glory  and  then — pfft! — her  light  was  out. 

An  eminent  psychologist  asked  the  question, 
"Why  Can't  They  Stay  Married?  "  He  meant 
picture  stars,  of  course,  and  here's  how  he 
answered  that  query,  "After  the  glamour  and 
romance  of  the  honeymoon  fades  away  the 
actor,  with  his  innate  habit  of  pretending,  can't 
face  the  realities  of  life."    Those  words  are  as 


Doug 
Fairbanks,  Jr. 


true  today  as  they  were  then. 
Just  by  way  of  comment  we 
ran  a  little  item  which  read, 
"Doug  Fairbanks  Jr.  thinks  John 
Barrymore  a  great  actor  and  ex- 
presses his  admiration  by  letting 
his  hair  grow  long  over  his 
collar."  Remember  when  every- 
body wondered  why  Doug  didn't 
get  a  hair  cut?  Now  look  at  him 
— close  cropped  and  smart  as  a 
fashion-plate  in  his  English 
clothes.  Jetta  Goudal  was  the 
girl  on  the  cover.  Clara  Bow, 
Emil  Jannings,  Gloria  Swanson, 
Ronald  Colman.  Renee  Adoree  and  George 
Bancroft  were  in  the  gallery. 

The  six  best  pictures  were  Lillian  Gish  in 
"The  Wind,"  Garbo  and  Gilbert  in  "Love," 
Norma  Shearer  and  Ramon  Novarro  in  "The 
Student  Prince."  "Rose  of  the  Golden  West." 
"Two  Arabian  Knights"  and  "Mile-a-minute 
Love"  with  Reginald  Denny. 

Cal  York  item:  Gloria  Swanson  denies  that 
she  and  the  Marquis  are  to  be  divorced.

No  Chaplin  Honors  for  Garbo 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  31 


Garbo  a  young  woman  who  has  done  much  to 
)  direct  the  attention  of  the  world  to  Sweden; 
who  has  given  the  people  of  Sweden  a  good 
object  lesson  in  success. 

Remember,  too,  that  Garbo  was  trained  in 
the  Royal  Dramatic  School  of  Stockholm; 
played  in  the  Royal  Dramatic  Theater. 

Surely,  the  royal  family  admires  Garbo  as 
an  actress.  The  king,  for  example,  is  fond  of 
motion  pictures;  has  them  exhibited  during  the 
i  winter  at  the  Royal  palace. 

But,  for  all  that, 'there  are  a  number  of  fac- 
tors which  would  prevent  a  situation  such  as 
that  in  which  Chaplin  found  himself  in  Lon- 
don. For  one  thing,  court  life  in  Sweden  can- 
not be  termed  pretentious.  There  are  recep- 
tions, to  be  sure,  and  the  Crown  Prince,  the 
most  popular  man  in  Sweden,  entertains,  but 
everything  moves  more  quietly,  in  keeping  with 
the  general  tenor  of  the  country  itself. 

At  intervals  there  are  invitations  to  opera 
singers  .  .  .  invitations  which  might  be  con- 
strued as  "command"  appearances,  but  the 
word  "request"  would  be  much  more  appro- 
priate. There  isn't  a  great  deal  of  fuss  and 
hullabaloo.  Members  of  the  royal  family  lead 
an  active,  constructive  life.    And  that's  that. 

So  Garbo  had  no  need  to  worry  about  "com- 
mand "  appearances.  If  she  wanted  to  be  left 
alone  the  royal  family,  it  is  safe  to  say,  would 
have  been  the  last  to  interfere  with  her  wishes. 

T\  7HAT  does  the  royal  family  really  think  of 
VV  her?  Are  they  interested  or  amused  at  the 
publicity  given  Garbo  in  America?  Did  they 
consider  how  to  give  formal  recognition  in  some 
way  to  Garbo  as  a  great  actress,  or  as  a  famous 
citizen,  or  as  a  girl  who  has  achieved  something 
:  worthwhile? 

It's  something  of  a  puzzle,  a  secret;  and  the 
answer  is  locked  inside  the  beautiful  walls  of 
a  beautiful  castle. 

And  it's  safe  to  say  that  Garbo,  vacationing 


at  a  luxurious  summer  villa  in  the  Stockholm 
archipelago,  concerned  with  swimming,  sleep- 
ing and  the  love  of  a  free  life,  gave  the  matter 
no  thought.    Like  all  Swedes,  she  respects  and  , 
admires  the  royal  family. 

There  is  an  interesting  anecdote,  in  this  con- 
nection. It  concerns  Ivar  Kreuger,  the  match 
king.  Kreuger,  so  the  story  goes,  was  invited, 
along  with  other  business  leaders,  to  a  recep- 
tion  at  the  royal  castle.  He  didn't  attend. 
Perhaps  because  he  knew  that  he  would,  by  | 
precedence,  be  seated  quite  a  way  from  the 
head  table.    Perhaps  because  he  was  too  busy. 

Stockholm  chuckled. 

I  don't  think  Garbo  would  have  had  to  fear 
a  situation  like  that.  Her  genius  would  have 
been  respected  and  honored  accordingly. 

In  London,  in  his  pre-fame  days,  Chaplin 
wore  his  baggy  trousers,  his  flappy  shoes,  and 
got  nowhere.  And  so  in  the  beginning  in 
Stockholm,  Garbo  was  just  another  young  girl 
with  theatrical  ambitions.  A  few  persons  be- 
lieved in  her,  but  only  a  few. 

In  the  reviews  which  Swedish  newspapers 
gave,  in  1924,  to  "  The  Legend  of  Gosta  Berling' ' 
the  first  film  in  which  Garbo  had  anything  like 
a  major  role,  there  was  only  a  scant  mention 
of  her.    One  newspaper  commented: 

"  Ebba  Dohna  is  played  by  Mona  Martenson, 
who  is  pretty  and  lively;  Elizabeth  Dohna  by 
Greta  Garbo,  who  is  pretty  in  a  more  amusing 
sort  of  way. " 

"Amusing"!    But  only  slightly  so. 

So  Garbo  also  had  to  look  to  America. 

But  I'm  sure  that  Garbo  has  no  bitterness 
toward  the  Swedish  people  for  all  that.  Why 
should  she?  She  must  realize,  as  she  did  then, 
that  Swedish  simplicity  was  not  big  enough  to 
afford  her  full  play  for  her  talent  and  ambitions. 

What  does  Sweden  think  of  Garbo  now? 

For  one  thing,  her  life,  to  the  Swedish  people, 
is  an  amazing  fairy  tale;  a  bit  of  unreality;  that 
she  should  sweep  so  high  on  the  curve  of  sue-

An  old  still  from  a  film  that  made  motion  picture  history.  This  is  the 
way  Garbo  looked— and  acted— in  her  first  picture,  "The  Legend  of 
Gosta  Berling."  The  character  actress  with  her  had  a  larger  part, 
but  Garbo — then  unheard  of  in  this  country — only  is  remembered

cess  is  fascinating.  But  don't  forget  that  Garbo 
comes  back  to  Sweden  as  a  distinct  type,  as 
interesting  to  the  Swedes  as  to  the  people  of 
other  countries. 

So  Garbo  has  become,  in  a  way,  the  personi- 
fication of  success.  The  story  of  her  life  has  be- 
come one  of  the  living  sagas  of  Swedish  history. 

Of  course,  the  Swedes  appreciate  Garbo  as 
an  actress.  Her  following  in  Sweden  is  no  less 
sincere  than  in  the  United  States.  Interesting, 
too,  is  the  fact  that  she  is  especially  popular 
among  girls  and  women.  Here  again  Garbo's 
type  proves  itself  irresistible. 

f~*  ARBO'S  inherent  modesty  is  another  factor 
^^in  her  favor.  Kreuger,  the  match  king,  got 
attention  by  forgetting  to  be  modest.  Garbo, 
of  the  two ,  was  more  typically  Swedish  in  her 
attitude  toward  the  public. 

Sweden,  therefore,  as  a  whole,  is  proud  of 
Garbo. 

"  The  Swedes  love  her, "  says  a  man  who  was 
in  the  film  business  in  Sweden  when  Garbo  was 
first  struggling  to  catch  a  glimmering  of  suc- 
cess. 

"  She's  a  wonderful  girl, "  sighs  an  old  woman 
who  knew  Garbo  when  the  actress  lived  in 
"soder"  Stockholm. 

"She's  a  real  Swedish  girl,"  comments  the 
woman  who  comes  to  clean  my  apartment. 

And  if  you  want  a  real  indication  of  Sweden's 
attitude  toward  Garbo,  look  to  the  press. 

Two  weeks  after  Garbo  landed  in  Sweden 
her  whereabouts  were  still  a  mystery. 

"Why,"  I  said  to  another  Swedish  news- 
paperman, "haven't  you  fellows  located  Gar- 
'  bo?"  He  grinned.   He  shrugged  his  shoulders. 

"Oh,  we  sort  of  decided  to  leave  her  alone. 
If  she  wants  a  rest,  let  her  have  it. "  Imagine 
an  American  reporter  talking  that  way! 

Not  that  the  Swedish  papers  are  altogether 
kind  and  gentle  to  Garbo.  They  love,  too 
well,  their  irony  and  caricature.  And  the  Swed- 
ish newspaperman,  as  a  rule,  says  what  he 
thinks.  When  Garbo  returned,  several  news- 
papers commented,  a  bit  ironically,  on  the  fact 
;  that  Garbo  couldn't  keep  from  acting.  But 
they  made  up  for  it  by  such  statements  as  this: 

"The  'Sphinx'  smiles  and  the  interview  is 
over.  She  nods  her  head  in  farewell.  Her  smile 
is  a  tired  smile,  not  the  same  happy  smile  that 
she  had  four  years  ago,  but  it  has  the  same 
charm,  perhaps  it  is  even  warmer.  For.  in 
spite  of  all  her  technique,  Greta  Garbo  smiles 
with  all  her  heart,  with  a  real  and  warm  Swed- 
I  ish  girl  heart,  and  without  that  genuine  smile 
and  that  girlish  heart,  all  of  Garbo's  technique 
would  have  availed  her  nothing. " 

So  the  Swedish  press,  on  the  whole,  is  kind 
to  Garbo.  They  caricature  her.  But  so  do 
they  every  prominent  person,  even  the  king. 
One  newspaper  declared  that  Garbo's  career 
had  been  an  inspiration  to  the  country.  .An- 
other paper  immediately  suggested  that  it  was 
therefore  appropriate  that  Garbo  be  made  a 
member  of  the  Swedish  parliament 

"DUT  I  had  to  admit  amazement  when  I 
•^learned  that  one  Stockholm  newspaper  not 
only  knew  where  Garbo  was  hiding,  and  was 
'  making  no  effort  to  interview  her  or  photo- 
i  graph  her,  but  knew  also  that  she  had  been  in 
Stockholm  to  place  a  wreath  of  roses  on  the 
grave  of  Mauritz  Stiller,  her  first  director. 

"Are  you  printing  anything?"  I  asked. 

"No." 

'Why  not?" 

The  gentleman  of  the  press  only  shrugged 
his  shoulders,  and  the  attitude  seemed  to  be 
that  Garbo's  indulgence  in  a  bit  of  sentiment 
was  her  own  precious  affair. 

So  Garbo  remained  unmolested  on  her  vaca- 
tion in  the  homeland.  She  was  smiling  when 
she  came  down  that  long  gangplank.  She  un- 
derstood her  countrymen.  She  knew  that  here 
peace  and  quiet  were  before  her. 

"Heja,  Greta!" 

And  in  spite  of  her  avoidance  of  the  public, 
her  heart  must  have  warmed  to  that  Norseman 
shout.  For  was  she  not  homesick  to  hear 
once  more  the  speech  of  her  mother  tongue? 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  November,  1932 


Brief  Reviews  of  Current  Pictures 

[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  12  ] 


•     STATE'S  ATTORNEY  —  Radio  Pictures.  — 
Obviously  built  for  John  Barrymore — but  how 
he  plays  the  parti    Helen  Twelvetrees  is  good.  (.July) 

STOWAWAY— Universal.— Melodrama  and  talk 
on  a  coastal  freighter  that  wouldn't  matter,  except 
for  Fay  VVray's  beauty.     (May) 

STRANGE  CASE  OF  CLARA  DEANE,  THE— 

Paramount. — A  strong  picture,  but  so  similar  to  "The 
Sin  of  Madelon  Claudet"  that  it  detracts  from  its 
punch.  Cora  Sue  Collins  looms  up  as  one  of  the  few 
great  child  performers.  Frances  Dee  and  Dudley 
Digges  lend  strength  to  the  story.     (June) 

•  STRANGE  INTERLUDE— M-G-M.—  From 
a  technical  standpoint — the  most  daring  picture 
ever  produced.  Imagine  Eugene  O'Neill's  analytical 
play  in  movies!  The  utterance  of  unspoken  thoughts 
makes  the  film  both  novel  and  interesting.  Norma 
Shearer  and  Clark  Gable  astonishingly  good.    (Sept.) 

•  STRANGE  LOVE  OF  MOLLY  LOUVAIN, 
THE — First  National. — Suspense,  humor  and 
heart  interest  adroitly  shaken  together.  Intriguing 
plot.  Ann  Dvorak  and  Lee  Tracy  do  a  swell  job. 
(June) 

STRANGER  IN  TOWN  —  Warners.  —  When 
you've  seen  Chic  Sale  in  one  picture,  you've  seen 
him  in  all.  If  you  liked  the  others,  you'll  like  this. 
(Aug.) 

STRANGERS  OF  THE  EVENING— Tiffany 
Prod. — Rip-roaring  comedy  combined  with  lots  of 
mystery  and  shudders.     (July) 

STREET  OF  WOMEN  —  Warners.  —  Roland 
Young's  sprightly  acting  saves  this  story  from  gloom. 
Kay  Francis  is  splendid.    (July) 

•  SUCCESSFUL  CALAMITY,  A— Warners.— 
Not  the  greatest  George  Arliss  picture,  but  dis- 
tinctly worthwhile.  About  the  problems  of  a  modern 
family.    (July) 

•  SYMPHONY  OF  SIX  MILLION— Radio 
Pictures. — A  beautifully  told  story  of  love  and 
service  for  all  the  family  to  see.  Ricardo  Cortez  is  a 
doctor  in  the  tenement  district,  and  Irene  Dunne  a 
crippled  girl  who  devotes  her  time  to  blind  children. 
(June) 

TEMPEST— UFA.— Emil  Jannings  fine  in  a  Ger- 
man-made comedy-drama  with  English  titles  that 
help  but  do  not  adequately  explain  the  action.   (May) 

TENDERFOOT,  THE— First  National.— Joe  E. 
Brown  as  a  cowboy  from  Texas  hits  Broadway,  and 
the  laughs  begin.    Weak  story,  but  funny  gags.  (July) 

TEXAS  BAD  MAN,  THE— Universal.— Tom 
Mix  impersonates  a  desperado  to  trap  the  bandits. 
(A  ug.) 

THEFT  OF  THE  MONA  LISA,  THE— Tobis.— 
Love  story  of  an  Italian  lad.  German  drama  with 
few  English  titles,  making  the  picture  lack  interest 
for  those  who  do  not  understand  German.     (June) 

THIRTEEN  WOMEN  —  RKO-Radio.  —  Mental 
suggestion,  with  fantastic  results,  is  the  brand-new 
theme  of  this  gripping  picture.  Myrna  Loy  (who 
plays  a  Hindu  girl  magnificently),  Irene  Dunne  and 
Ricardo  Cortez.    (Oct.) 

THE  STOKER— First  Division-Allied.— Even  the 
American  Marines  get  into  this  melodramatic  jumble. 
Pretty  poor  stuff.     (Sept.) 

THEY  NEVER  COME  BACK— First  Division- 
Artclass. — A  dull  story  of  a  prize-fighter  and  a  night 
club  performer.  Regis  Toomey  and  Dorothy 
Sebastian.     (Aug.) 

•  THIS  IS  THE  NIGHT— Paramount.— This  is 
a  light  and  farcical  interlude  that  movie-goers 
long  for.  Lily  Damita  is  charming  as  is  Thelma 
Todd.  Roland  Young  and  Charles  Ruggles  are  mar- 
velous comedians.    (June) 

THUNDER  BELOW  —  Paramount.  —  Tallulah 
Bankhead  emerges  from  melodramatic  plot  as  an 
actress  of  distinction.  Paul  Lukas,  Ralph  Forbes  and 
Charles  Bickford.    (July) 

•  TIGER  SHARK— First  National.— An  excit- 
ing adventure  picture.  Edward  G.  Robinson  is 
great,  and  Zita  Johann  brings  a  new  type  of  shady 
dame  to  the  screen.    (Oct.) 

•  TOM  B ROWN  OF  CULVER  —  Universal.  — 
All  the  action  takes  place  at  Culver  Military 
Academy.  A  swell  picture  for  the  whole  family  to 
see.     (Sept.) 

TRAPEZE — Harmonie-Film. — A  story  of  circus 
life,  with  German  dialogue,  English  captions  and  ex- 
cellent acting  by  Anna  Sten.     (July) 

•  TRIAL  OF  VIVIENNE  WARE,  THE— Fox.— 
A  fine  balance  of  drama  and  humor.  Joan 
Bennett  plays  a  lovely  prisoner  accused  of  murder. 
Donald  Cook,  her  attorney,  will  cause  a  flutter  among 
feminine  movie-goers.  But  the  laughs  go  to  ZaSu 
Pitts  and  Skeets  Gallagher.     (June) 


TWO    AGAINST    THE    WORLD— Warners  — 

Weak  story,  but  Constance  Bennett  looks  pretty  and 
does  good  work  in  a  shallow  role.  Neil  Hamilton  and 
Allen  Vincent  are  the  boys.     (Oct.) 

TWO  FISTED  LAW— Columbia.— Tim  McCoy 
Western  in  which  another  villain  forecloses  the 
mortgage  on  the  old  ranch.    Heh-heh!     (Aug.) 

•  TWO  SECONDS— First  National.— If  you 
don't  like  your  drama  full  measure,  don't  see 
this.  The  story  of  what  passes  through  a  man's  mind 
in  the  last  two  seconds  he  is  conscious  before  electro- 
cution. Edward  Robinson's  work  is  memorable  and 
the  beauty  of  Vivienne  Osborne  impressive.     (June) 

UNASHAMED— M-G-M.— Lewis  Stone  tries  hard 
to  save  this  unbelievable  story,  but  doesn't  quite. 
Helen  Twelvetrees  and  Robert  Young.     (Sept.) 

UNHOLY  LOVE— First  Division-Allied.— Based 
on  Flaubert's  "Madame  Bovary."  Neither  very  im- 
portant nor  very  entertaining.     (Oct.) 

VANISHING  FRONTIER,  THE— Paramount. 
— You'll  like  Johnny  Mack  Brown  with  a  Spanish 
accent  as  the  hold-up  man  in  this  story  of  early 
California.     (Sept.) 

VANITY  FAIR— Allied  Pictures.  — They've 
dressed  Becky  Sharp  up  in  modern  clothes  and  made 
her  Myrna  Loy,  and  if  you  didn't  read  the  book 
you'll  enjoy  the  picture.     (May) 

WAR  CORRESPONDENT  — Columbia.— Jack 

Holt,  Ralph  Graves  and  Lila  Lee  in  a  stirring  story  of 
activities  on  the  Chinese  battle  front.    (Oct.) 

•  WASHINGTON  MASQUERADE,  THE  — 
M-G-M.— Washington— politics— Lionel  Barry- 
more  as  the  respected  attorney  who  goes  wrong,  and 
Karen  Morley  as  the  scheming  vamp.  A  grand 
picture.  (Sept.) 

WEEK-END  MARRIAGE— First  National- 
Wives,  it  seems  from  this,  shouldn't  work  and 
Loretta  Young  and  Norman  Foster  explain  it  all  in 
this  earnest  picture.      (Aug.) 

WEEK  ENDS  ONLY— Fox.— Not  new  in  plot, 
but  camouflaged  with  bright  tinsel.  Joan  Bennett 
does  well  as  a  rich  girl  made  poor  by  the  stock  market 
crash.     (Aug.) 

WESTWARD  PASSAGE  —  RKO-Pathe.  —  Ann 
Harding,  ZaSu  Pitts  and  Irving  Pichel.  The  story  is 
entertaining  enough  but  it  lacks  pep  and  punch. 
(Aug.) 

•  WET  PARADE— M-G-M.— Both  sides  of  the 
prohibition  problem  presented  in  two  hours  of 
exciting,  thrilling  drama  with  an  excellent  cast. 
Don't  miss  this.     (May) 

•  WHAT  PRICE  HOLLYWOOD  —  RKO- 
Pathe. — Fast  and  fascinating  entertainment 
and  all  very  true  to  Hollywood.  Constance  Bennett 
gives  her  finest  performance.  Lowell  Sherman  is 
great.     (Aug.) 

WHEN  A  FELLER  NEEDS  A  FRIEND— M-G- 

M. — The  fine  acting  of  Jackie  Cooper  and  Chic  Sale 
furnish  such  a  delicious  frosting,  you  forget  the  cake 
is  a  bit  soggy.    Full  of  humor  and  pathos.     (June) 

WHILE  PARIS  SLEEPS— Fox.— A  rip-snorting 
mellerdrammer  of  Parisian  life  through  a  Hollywood 
spyglass.     (A  ug.) 

WHISTLIN"  DAN— Tiffany  Prod.— A  Ken  May- 
nard  Western  with  a  plot  above  the  average.    (May) 

WHITE  ZOMBIE— United  Artists.— An  utterly 
fantastic  tale  about  the  half-dead,  known  as  zombies, 
who  rise  from  their  graves.  Madge  Bellamy  and 
Bela  Lugosi.  And  vou  don't  need  to  bother  seeing  it. 
(Sept.) 

WHY  SAPS  LEAVE  HOME— Best  International 
Pictures. — England  takes  a  jab  at  American  gangsters 
in  a  hilarious  travesty.     (May) 

•    WINNER  TAKE  ALL-Warners.— One  of  the 
fastest,  laugh-provoking  pictures  on  the  screen. 
Jimmy  Cagney  is  great.    Don't  miss  it.    (July) 

WOMAN  IN  ROOM  13,  THE— Fox.— Wives, 
sweethearts  and  careers.  Elissa  Landi  gives  a  strong 
performance  in  a  weak  story.     (July) 

WORLD  AND  THE  FLESH,  THE— Paramount. 
— Against  a  Russian  background  are  set  George  Ban- 
croft and  Miriam  Hopkins.    Mild.     (July) 

WYOMING  WHIRLWIND,  THE— Willis  Kent 
Prod. — A  Lane  Chandler  Western.    (July) 

•  YOUNG  AMERICA— Fox.— This  is  about 
those  youngsters  who  get  the  reputation  for 
being  the  "worst  kids  in  town."  Raymond  Borzage 
steals  the  show.  Doris  Kenyon  has  never  been  love- 
lier, and  Spencer  Tracy  and  Ralph  Bellamy  do  grand 
work.     (June) 

YOUNG  BRIDE— RKO-Pathe.— Eric  Linden  and 
Helen  Twelvetrees  are  better  than  the  story.    (May) 


Fay  H'ray,  RKO  Star

T_T()I.L\  \\  <  >(ff>  is  fast  becoming  one,  big, 
■*-  happy  nursery.  Barbara  Stanwyck  is  the 
latest  to  adept  a  baby.  For  a  long  time  she 
■  be  found  gazing  longingly  at  toys  in 
shop  windows. 

Lit ili-  Dickie  Moore  was  lucky  enough  to 
play  with  her  in  a  picture  and  she  showered 
him  with  all  sorts  of  gifts. 

She  has  been  nurturing  the  names  Michael 
and  Kathleen  for  years  and  her  adopted  boy 
is  called  Dion,  instead  of  Mike.  Xo  one  knows 
the  reason  and  she  won't  tell  even  her  dearest 
friends  where  she  found  the  child. 

There  is  a  trained  nurse  with  him  all  day 
and  that  is  the  only  cloud  in  Barbara's  happi- 
ness. 

She  is  trying  to  make  up  for  the  years  by 
playing  with  the  baby,  but  the  nurse  puts  a 
limit  on  this  with  a  time  watch. 

Husband  Frank  Fay  adores  the  child  almost 
as  much  as  Barbara  does. 

A  T  last,  the  movie  star;  win  the  social  recog- 
"*  ^-nition  they've  craved  for  lo,  these  many 
years. 

A  rather  hoity-toity  foreign  consul  in  Los 
Angeles  who  has  been  very  much  wined  and 
dined  by  the  elite  of  Beverly  Hills,  recently 
remarked  that  he  would  now  proceed  to  weed 
out  his  many  acquaintances  and  concentrate 


upon  the  motion  picture  folk,  as  they  are  really 
the  only  ones  in  California  worth  knowing. 

And  have  those  certain  social  leaders  who 
treated  the  movie  folk  like  book  agents  got 
red  faces! 

TF  you  had  gone  early  to  the  last  concert  in 
the  Hollywood  Bowl  this  season,  you  would 
have  seen  Hedda  Hopper  and  Verree  Teasdale 
(old  friends)  calmly  sitting  on  one  of  the  hard 
benches  eating  chicken  sandwiches  and  drink- 
ing coffee  from  a  thermos  bottle. 

They  wanted  good  seats  so  they  came  early, 
made  their  choice  and  brought  their  supper 
along! 

A     HOLLYWOOD  columnist  vouches  for 

*■  this  one. 

It  seems  Groucho  Marx  was  parked  double 
on  Hollywood  Boulevard  and  a  huge  truck 
tried  to  get  by. 

"Hey,  there,"  the  truck  driver  shouted, 
"get  that  thing  out  of  there. " 

Groucho's  little  son  popped  his  head  out  of 
the  window  and  yelled,  "Hey,  there,  yourself. 
That's  no  way  to  talk  to  an  actor. " 

Y\  7HEN  Director  Frank  Borzage  chose  Alice 

^^  Adair  for  a  part  in  Helen  Hayes'  and 

Gary  Cooper's  "A  Farewell  to  Arms,"  he  an- 


nounced that  it  was  because  of  her  expressive 
legs. 

He  was  swamped  by  inquiries.  What  did 
he  mean — expressive  legs? 

So  Frank  prepared  a  statement  showing  how 
feet  and  legs  express  emotion  and  why  they 
are  valuable  to  pictures  for  other  things  than 
attracting  the  male  attention.  Here  it  is,  dried 
down  to  a  few  sentences: 

Love:  the  girl  who  likes  to  rise  on  her  toes 
likes  to  be  kissed. 

Anger:  the  young  lady  who  keeps  the  ball  of 
one  foot  off  the  ground  is  subject  to  fits  of 
anger. 

Shyness:  the  girl  who  winds  one  foot  around 
the  calf  of  the  leg  is  a  shrinking  violet. 

Embarrassment:  she  who  presses  one  foot 
with  the  ball  of  the  other  reveals  embarrass- 
ment. 

Covetousness:  the  golddigger  invariably  puts 
the  toe  of  one  slipper  under  the  arch  of  the 
other. 

Confidence:  one  who  crosses  her  legs  uncon- 
sciously is  always  at  ease  and  believes  in  her- 
self. 

Defiance:  if  a  girl  takes  a  seat,  stretches  her 
legs  out  with  knees  nearly  straight — she  defies 
convention.    And  she's  a  dangerous  dame. 

Read  your  characteristics  by  your  legs,  girls. 
It's  Hollywood's  latest  method!

THE  RAID  ON  THE 
SABINE  WOMEN 

"Nature  in  the  Raw"  — as 
portrayed  by  Saul  Tepper  .  .  . 
inspired  by  the  story  of  the 
Roman  warriors'  ruthless 
capture  of  the  Sabine  village 
for  the  express  purpose  of 
carrying  off  its  u'omen 
(290  B.  C). 


— and  raw  tobaccos 
have  no  place  in  cigarettes 


They  are  not  present  in  Luckies 

,  .  .  the  mildest  cigarette 

you  ever  smoked 

E  buy  the  finest,  the  very 
finest  tobaccos  in  all  the 
world  — but  that  does  not  ex- 
plain why  folks  everywhere 
regard  Lucky  Strike  as  the 
mildest  cigarette.  The  fact  is,  we 
never  overlook  the  truth  that 
"Nature  in  the  Raw  is  Seldom 


Mild" — so  these  fine  tobaccos, 
after  proper  aging  and  mellow- 
ing, are  then  given  the  benefit 
of  that  Lucky  Strike  purify- 
ing process,  described  by  the 
words  — "It's  toasted".  That's 
why  folks  in  every  city,  town 
and  hamlet  say  that  Luckies  are 
such  mild  cigarettes.

OLD   DUTCH  CLEANSER  IS 


the  only  cleanser  you  need  in  your  home 


What  a  saving  that  is! . . .  one  cleanser  that 
eliminates  the  need  for  all  others,  that 
cleans  more  things,  cleans  quicker,  and 
costs  less  to  use  because  it  goes  further 

Old  Dutch  is  unequalled  for  bathroom,  sink  and 
refrigerator,  as  well  as  for  the  heavier  cleaning  tasks 
of  removing  smoke,  soot  and  stains  from  porcelain 
stoves,  brick  fireplaces,  and  accessories. 

There's  a  simple  scientific  reason  why  Old  Dutch 
costs  less  to  use.  It  is  because  its  flaky,  flat-shaped 
particles  cover  more  surface,  consequently  go  further 
and  do  more  cleaning. 

Old  Dutch  Cleanser  doesn't  scratch,  doesn't  clog 
drains,  keeps  hands  lovely  too,  because  it  contains  no 
caustic  or  acid.  Possessing  a  distinctive  detergent 
energy  Old  Dutch  Cleanser  quickly  removes  both 
visible  dirt  and  invisible  impurities,  bringing 
wholesome  healthful  cleanliness. 

Use  this  modern  cleanser  throughout  your 
home,  and  like  millions  of  other  women  you 
will  find  it  is  the  only  cleanser  you  need. 

The  largest  selling  cleanser  in  the  world 


Read  Mrs.  Petrey's  interesting 

experience  with  Old  Dutch 

"Being  a  graduate  nurse,  cleanliness  to  me 
does  not  mean  ordinary  cleaning  or  ordinary 
cleansers.  Therefore,  from  my  front  door  to  my 
back  door,  the  woodwork  is  kept  spotless,  light 
fixtures  gJeaming,  bathroom  bright,  mirrors  and 
windows  polished,  china  and  silver  free  from 
stains  with  nothing  but  Old  Dutch  Cleanser. 

"It  is  unsurpassed  for  cleaning  linoleum, 
painted  furniture,  tiled  or  brick  fireplaces, 
children's  toys  or  pearl  buttons  on  their 
clothes.  Also  for  removing  vegetable  stains 
from  aluminum  or  china. 

"For  these  reasons  my  supply  shelf  is  always 

stocked  with  Old  Dutch  Cleanser  "

When  the  audience  speaks  the  stars  and  producers  listen.  We  offer  three  prizes  for  the 
best  letters  of  the  month— $25,  $10  and  $5.  Literary  ability  doesn't  count.  But  candid 
opinions  and  constructive  suggestions  do.  We  must  reserve  the  right  to  cut  letters  to 
suit  space  limitations.    Address  The  Editor,  PHOTOPLAY,  221  W.  57th  St.,  New  York  City. 


"Rain"  brought  in  a  flood  of  comments.  Joan  Craw- 
ford was  compared  to  Jeanne  Eagels  and  Gloria 
Swanson,  and  opinion  was  divided  on  Walter  Huston 


The  love  scenes  in  "Smilin"  Through"  won  high 
praise.  "Quite  different  from  the  modern  'Well,  kid, 
shall  we  tell  it  to  a  judge?' "  comments  a  grandfather 


THE  $25  LETTER 

I'm  a  reporter  who  interviews  movie  celeb- 
rities at  Wichita  railway  stations,  airports,  ho- 
tels an<l  theaters.  Of  recent  months  I've  met 
Ann  Harding,  Lupe  Yelez,  Victor  McLaglen, 
Chic  Sale,  Harpo  Marx,  Will  Rogers,  Nancy 
Carroll,  Wallace  Beery,  Kvalyn  Knapp  and 
others. 

And  I've  never  seen  one  who  wasn't  swell. 
Actor  or  actress  may  be  tired,  hungry,  even 
sick,  but  there's  always  a  welcome  to  the  re- 
porter, cheerful  answers  to  impertinent  ques- 
tions about  work,  love  affairs  and  favorite 
breakfast  dishes,  an  animated  smile  for  the 
cameraman  and  a  hearty  ''  so  long  "  at  the  end. 

They  could  refuse  to  see  me  and  get  away 
with  it.  I've  been  snubbed  by  plenty  of  other 
big  shots — aviators,  politicians,  financiers,  min- 
isters, authors — who  went  right  on  being  big 
shots  afterward.  This  whole  town  of  120,000 
wouldn't  really  make  much  difference  one  way 
or  another  in  achieving  national  success  or  fail- 
ure. And  probably  they're  not  dying  to  meet 
me  personally. 

But  it  seems  part  of  the  acting  job  to  be  a 
good  guy. 

Manly  Wade  Wellman,  Wichita,  Kan. 

THE  $10  LETTER 

We  accept  the  flimsy  props  and  backdrops 
of  the  stage  without  question.  We  accept  the 
papier-mache  parapet  of  "Lysistrata";  and  the 
hempen  grass  and  two  skulls  of  "Hamlet''  are, 
to  us,  a  crowded  graveyard-  yet  we  howl  with 
derision  if  an  impressive  movie  desert  scene 
turns  out  to  have  been  filmed  in  the  Mojave 
instead  of  the  Gobi.  What  difference  does  it 
make?  Let  the  Mona  Lisa  be  really  painted 
on  wood  and  impossible  to  hide  in  a  flower  bas- 


ket! "  Arsene  Lupin"  was  still  a  great  picture. 
What  if  Arrows mitli's  laboratory  technique  was 
bad?  Who  cares?  What  if  Tarzan  used  a 
double,  and  many  scenes  were  superimposed— 
we  loved  it.  After  all,  "  the  play's  the  thing. " 
Cornelia  Porter,  Chicago,  111. 

THE  So  LETTER 

For  a  long  time  I  have  endured  the  misrep- 
resentation of  my  sex,  but  no  longer!  Now,  I 
won't  say  the  average  man  is  as  good  a  cook 
as  a  woman,  but  I  will  say  that  he  isn't  one- 


SYMPAT  HY  for  Jean  Harlow  and 
admiration  for  her  pluck;  pleas 
for  less  stern  reality  in  screen  stories 
and  enthusiasm  for  the  new  "ro- 
mantic cycle"  in  pictures;  these  are 
just  a  few  of  the  interesting  topics 
covered  in  the  mail  this  month. 

The  most  popular  boys  of  the  mo- 
ment  are  Bob  Montgomery  (he 
leads  them  all),  Lee  Tracy,  John 
Boles,  Lewis  Stone,  Clark  Gable  and 
Lew  Ayres. 

The  most  popular  girl  (and  no 
one  else  rivals  her  in  interest  this 
month)  is  Irene  Dunne. 

The  most  popular  pictures?  Well, 
"Rain"  is  the  most  discussed,  "Smil- 
in* Through"  the  most  loved,  "A 
Bill  of  Divorcement"  one  of  the 
most  praised,  "The  Phantom  Presi- 
dent" and  "Blessed  Event"  among 
the  most  enjoved. 

What  do  you  think  about  pictures 
and  film  personalities?  Whv  not 
tell  us,  and  perhaps  win  a  pri:e! 


half   as   clumsy    as    the    talkies   would   have 
him. 

Xo  man  grabs  a  hotfrying-pan  with  his  bare 
hand;  his  greater  scientific  knowledge  tells  him 
that  metal  is  an  excellent  conductor  of  heat. 
Furthermore,  he  doesn't  let  coffee  boil  over. 
Neither  does  his  Jav?  resemble  tar.  Remem- 
ber— you  movie  gag  men — that  many  a  poor 
male  must  make  his  own  coffee,  and  who  do 
you  suppose  makes  that  tasty  golden-brown 
liquid  on  camping  trips? 

Perhaps  the  laugh  that  women  get  from 
man's  supposed  lack  of  culinary  technique  is 
worth  it,  but  just  the  same,  I  do  know  men 
who  don't  burn  steaks  or  drop  dishes! 

Fred  E.  Ebel,  Milwaukee,  Wis. 

JEAN  HARLOW 

The  front  pages  recently  carried  news  of  the 
movie  colony  that  recalled  to  mind  scenes  in 
Constance  Bennett's  "What  Price  Hollywood." 
The  tragic  death  of  Paul  Bern  started  the 
presses  of  the  yellow  journals  and  the  tongues 
of  the  scandal-mongers. 

I  never  believe  anything  that  has  not  been 
proved  in  court;  it  is  the  only  way  to  keep  one's 
illusions  and  avoid  becoming  cynical.     Let's 
not  hurt  Jean  Harlow  by  listening  to  gossip. 
Mary  Helex  Williamson, 
Los  Angeles,  Calif. 

Let  us,  by  our  support,  do  our  part  to  keep 
Jean  Harlow  where  she,  by  her  courage  and 
sportsmanship,  belongs.  It  is  not  for  us  to 
condemn  her  for  her  part  in  the  circumstances 
over  which  she  probably  had  no  control. 
Rather,  by  our  loyalty,  show  her  she  has  our 
sympathy  and  admiration. 

Frances  G.  QODJN,  Los  Angeles,  Calif.

The  powerful,  dramatic  situations  in  which  Katharine  Hepburn  and 
John  Barrymore  found  themselves  in  "A  Bill  of  Divorcement"  appeal- 
ed to  the  serious-minded.     "Superbly  acted,  too,"  they  said 


[  CON'TIXl'L.)  FROM  PAGE  6  ] 


I  read  with  indignation  the  newspaper  col- 
umns which  intimated  the  death  of  Paul  Bern 
might  be  the  doom  of  the  career  of  Jean  Har- 
low. The  public  should  consider  open-mind- 
cdly  the  unfortunate  circumstances  in  which 
an  actress  may  become  involved.  Jean  has 
proved  herself  a  sincere,  intelligent  actress.  I 
admired  her  in  '"Red-Headed  Woman''  for 
the  genuine  interpretation  of  the  character  she 
portrayed.  It  was  a  relentlessly  sincere  bit  of 
acting. 

Roxil  W.  Mott,  Tuckerton,  X.  J. 

Just  when  it  seemed  Jean  Harlow  had  a 
break  at  last,  along  came  tragedy.  Her  per- 
formance in  *' Red-Headed  Woman"  was  ex- 
cellent, and  proved  Jean  can  really  act.  It  is 
up  to  us,  who  are  known  as  the  ''fickle  fans," 
to  say  whether  this  great  tragedy  that  has 
come  to  Jean  Harlow  is  made  even  greater  by 
plunging  a  promising  career  into  oblivion.  She 
is  the  same  Harlow,  and  tragedy  can  come  to 
us  all. 

Lois  Epperxy,  Detroit.  Mich. 

NORMA,  LESLIE  AND  FKEDKIC 

"Smilin'  Through"  is  a  picture  that  will 
never  he  forgotten.  What  a  beautifully  sweet 
love  story!  The  hard-hearted,  the  cynical,  the 
world-weary  brush  away  the  tears  and  try  des- 
perately hard  to  overcome  that  choking  feeling 
in  their  throats  when  they  witness  the  beauty 
and  sadness  of  the  scene  depicting  Moonyeen's 
death  on  her  wedding  day. 

And,  what  actor  could  have  played  Sir  John 
with  the  charm,  skill  and  finesse  of  Leslie 
Howard?  Fredric  March — how  good  looking 
and  what  a  thorough  actor!  The  whole  cast 
is  excellent,  the  story  touching  and  beautiful, 
and  Norma  Shearer  is  the  loveliest  actress  on 
the  screen. 

B.  Morax,  Tulsa,  Okla.

WHERE  IS  THY  STING? 

Now,  don't  misunderstand  me,  I  liked  "  Smil- 
in' Through  "  and  even  shed  a  few  furtive  tears 
over  it.  But  when  I  die,  I  want  to  be  shot 
through  the  heart,  for  according  to  the  picture, 
it's  a  mighty  peaceful  death.    When  that  bul- 


let hits  Norma  Shearer  it's  just  beautiful  how 
she  passes  out  without  even  a  tremor  crossing 
her  face  or  one  little  lock  of  hair  out  of  place. 
Robert  Ellsworth,  Brooklyn.  N.  Y. 

TIPS  TO  NEGLECTED  WIVES 

How  to  get  romance  though  married? 
Simple,  very  simple.  Go  to  the  movies.  I  am 
just  a  small  town  wife — there  are  millions  of 
us  who  are  married  to  men  who  like  a  news- 
paper and  pipe  after  dinner  and  all  you  ca 
out  of  them  is  an  occasional  grunt.  Off  I  flee 
to  the  picture  show  and,  after  living  through 
the  picture  with  the  heroine,  walk  out  on  air 
and  go  home  happy. 

Mrs.  I..  M.  R.,  Albany,  Texas 

DUNNE  HAS  DONE  IT! 

I'm  a  hard-boiled  lawyer  with  little  or  no 
sentiment — but — am  I  an  Irene  Dunne  fan  now, 
or  am  I  an  Irene  Dunne  fan?  Nothing  frail  in 
her  beauty,  nothing  coy  in  her  actions — just 
real  gorgeousness,  and  all  of  it  topped  with 
true  histrionic  ability.  If  there  ever  was  a  true 
lady,  an  honest  actress  and  a  soulful  artist 
that  aroused  admiration  in  both  sexes,  Miss 
Dunne  is  that  person.  Her  reward  should  be 
nothing  less  than  a  chance  to  take  part  in  only 
the  finest  of  pictures. 

Earl  Kay,  Richmond,  Ind. 

JOHN  BOWLS    EM  OVER 

Who  could  keep  silent  after  watching  Irene 
Dunne  and  JohnBoles  look  into  each  other'seyes 
and  make  love  as  it  has  not  been  done  on  the 
screen  before?  Irene  Dunne  is  what  we  have 
been  looking  for:  a  beautiful  woman,  charm- 
ing, fascinating  and  sweet.  John  Boles  was 
perfect,  a  very  handsome  man  with  all  the  little 
selfishnesses  which  make  us  love  the  species! 
"Back  Street" — what  a  picture! 

Miriam  F.  Murphy,  Thomaston,  Conn. 

This  letter  is  written  in  defiance  of  no  theory, 
no  wise  and  beautiful  social  law.     In  "Back 


"  'Blessed  Event'  made  a  hit  with  my  family  because  of  its  up-to-the- 
minute  story  and  the  grand  acting  of  Lee  Tracy  and  Ruth  Donnelly," 
a    newspaperman    writes.      Others    mentioned    its    timeliness,    also

Street"  two  people  lived  and  loved;  built  a 
thing  of  beauty,  sacrifice  and  faithfulness 
around  their  world  from  which  all  so-called 
conventionalism  was  barred.  The  world  might 
be  a  happier  and  a  better  place  if  virtue  were 
always  rewarded  and  sin  always  punished,  but 
this  is  not  so  and  perhaps  not  so  intended. 
Mary  G.  Tyler,  Sioux  City,  Iowa 

I  watched  through  a  blur  of  tears  the  man 
and  the  woman  in  the  "  Back  Street"  of  Fannie 
Hurst's  novel  step  from  its  pages  and  become 
real,  living  characters  in  life.  Life  so  simply, 
so  tenderly,  so  exquisitely  portrayed  that  it 
exalted  and  made  glorious  a  love  which  we,  in 
our  pitiable,  human  frailty,  judge  and  con- 
demn. I  feel  sometimes  that  our  twentieth 
century  minds  have  become  so  surfeited  and 
disillusioned  with  the  sordid  realities  of  exist- 
ence that,  even  when  we  are  brought  face  to 
face  with  its  glowing  reality,  we  can  scarce 
comprehend  all  the  wonder,  the  beauty,  the 
fulfillment  of  a  perfect  love. 

Laurel  O'Coxxor,  Battle  Creek,  Mich.

ize more  than  ever  how  important  expert  direc- 
tion is.  Close  cooperation  between  writer,  di- 
rector and  star  (I've  placed  them  in  order  of 
their  importance  in  my  opinion.  Now  I'm  wait- 
ing for  brickbats  to  fly  from  ardent  star  fans 
after  they  read  that)  will  soon  raise  the  level 
of  pictures  to  the  height  they  belong.

WHY,  MRS.  STOUFFER! 

Some  folks  think  old  women  should  sit  at 
home  and  knit  and  read  the  Bible.  I'm  sev- 
enty-two past,  but  I  cannot  be  my  age.  I  love 
the  movies  and  I  adore  George  Arliss.  Would 
that  he  would  appear  in  many  more  pictures. 
Often  old  men  are  unattractive,  he  is  lovable. 

Mrs.  James  B.  Stouffer,  Richmond,  Ky. 


"I'm  glad  George  M.  Cohan  made  'The  Phantom  President'  before 
he  got  mad  at  Hollywood,"  says  a  reader.  "A  grand  picture — and 
wasn't  Claudette  Colbert  lovely?"     All  right — we'll  answer.     She  was! 


SADIE  THOMPSON 

I  didn't  see  either  the  stage  play  "Rain," 
or  the  silent  film,  and  so  don't  know  how  Joan 
Crawford's  Sadie  Thompson  compares  with 
Jeanne  Eagels'  or  Gloria  Swanson's.  I  think 
Joan's  performance  is  splendid  and  tremen- 


Some  folks  raved  about  Marlene  Dietrich  in  "Blonde  Venus,"  some 
about  Herbert  Marshall,  but  it  was  little  Dickie  Moore  who  apparently 
stole  the  show.    "We  hope  he  remains  unspoiled,"  comments  a  mother 


dously  touching.  It's  by  far  the  best  work 
she's  done.  I'll  never  forget  the  scene  in  which 
Sadie  is  won  over  to  religion  by  Rcjormer  Dav- 
idso?i. 

And  that  magnificent  moment  when  Sadie 
says  compassionately,  "I  feel  sorry  for  every- 
body in  the  world!" 

Thomas  Ryax,  New  York,  N.  Y. 

WE  TOLD  YOU  SO 

We  were  planning  to  see  Walter  Huston  in 
"American  Madness,"  but  as  the  night  was 
chilly  we  changed  our  minds.  Before  finally 
deciding  not  to  go,  however,  I  looked  over  the 
review  in  Photoplay.  The  criticism  was  so 
enthusiastic  that  we  were  impressed  and  de- 
cided to  go  and  see  if  the  picture  was  as  good  as 
the  review  said. 

What  a  picture !     We  all  said  we  would  not 
have   missed   it  for   anything  in    the    world. 
Huston's  was  a  superb  performance! 
Mrs.  G.  S.  Smith,  Great  Barrington,  Mass. 

NO  DANGER  IN  LESLIE'S  EYES? 

Leslie  Howard  seems  to  me  a  most  polished 
actor,  but  I  am  convinced  that  he  will  never 
experience  the  popularity  of  Clark  Gable.  His 
appeal  is  purely  intellectual. 

He  is  suave,  but  not  debonair;  he  is  a  cultured 
sophisticate,  but  not  intriguing.  He  is  charm- 
ing, but  not  glamorous  or  thrillingly  dangerous. 

He  does  not  possess  that  elusive  quality 
known  as  "sex  menace." 

Mary  Schubert,  Tacoma,  Wash. 

BOUQUET  FOR  JOHN  GILBERT 

You  can  all  have  your  Clark  Gables  and 
James  Cagneys,  but  I'll  take  John  Gilbert! 
His  performance  in  "  Downstairs"  as  the  quick- 
witted, charming,  fascinating,  handsome 
(words  fail  me)  chauffeur  was  a  knock-down. 
He  tried  a  comeback  and  he  clicked.

What  the  Audience  Thinks 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PACE  '■> 


Scenes  like  this  one  of  Bob  Montgomery  from  "Lovers  Courageous" 
seem  to  please.  Folks  like  Bob's  wise-cracking  dialogue  and  that  odd 
little  smirk.     "We  want  heroes  with  a  sense  of  humor,"  says  one  girl 


SHE  SCOLDS  JOHN 

Oh,  John  Gilbert,  why  did  you  ever  con- 
descend to  play  such  a  role  as  you  did  in 
"  Downstairs"?  And  why  do  you  want  to 
write  your  own  plays  if  you  can't  do  any  better 
than  this  one?  Butstillyouremainmyidol.niy 
dream  of  all  a  thrillingly  handsome  actor 
should  be. 

Mary  H.  Kerns,  Huntington,  W.  Ya. 

TELL  IT  TO  M-G-M 

Robert  Montgomery  is  my  favorite  star. 
Trouble  is,  I  don't  see  him  often  enough.  I 
have  the  grandest  photograph  of  Mr.  Mont- 
gomery and  I  keep  it  right  before  me  in  my 
office.  Gee,  wouldn't  I  like  to  have  him  for  my 
"  boss"!  I  look  at  his  picture  and  smile  to  my- 
self for  thinking  of  anything  so  ridiculous. 

Anyway,  if  my  boss  had  one-tenth  of  Bob's 
delightful  sense  of  humor,  wouldn't  it  be  just 
hunky-dory?  Everytime  he  gets  nasty  (which 
is  often)  1  simply  control  my  tongue  by  looking 
at  that  picture  and  I  say  to  myself,  "Oh,  if  it 
were  only  Robert  Montgomery  instead  of  this 
old  fellow ! "  To  make  a  long  story  short — why 
don't  they  give  Mr.  Montgomery  a  role  as 
"Somebody's  Boss."

GOLDEN  LAUGHTER 

Movie  crazy?  Indeed  more  people  would  be 
if  more  productions  like  "Movie  Crazy"  were 
released. 

When  a  limited  (and  I  really  mean  limited) 
amount  of  money  must  go  far  in  the  entertain- 
ment part  of  the  budget,  how  line  it  is  to  be 
able  to  see  a  show  that  leaves  you  weak — no, 
not  from  worries,  but  from  laughter!

GRAND  TROUPERS,  ALL 

I  saw  a  picture  last  night  that  I  enjoyed — 
"The  Vanishing  Frontier'' — full  of  old  favor- 
ites, capable  and  satisfying.  There  was  John 
Mack  Brown,  very  handsome,  with  a  Spanish 
accent  that  excelled  even  Warner  Baxter's 
"Arizona"  roles.  There  was  Wallace  Mac- 
Donald;  ZaSu  Pitts,  funnier  than  ever,  and 
those  beloved  players,  Raymond  Hatton  and  J. 
Farrell  MacDonald.  With  pictures,  as  with 
everything  else,  take  away  the  glamour  and  the 
sparkle  of  big  names  and  sometimes  there  is 
little  left.  Take  that  handful  of  players  and 
without  any  glitter  they  gave  us  a  good  picture.

AMERICANIZING  WITH  MOVIES 

I  was  presented  with  quite  a  problem  when 
my  husband's  sister  from  Russia  came  lure 
with  her  family  to  make  their  home.  The 
language,  customs  and  American  clothes  were 
all  so  strange  to  therri.  At  first  I  was  horrified 
at  having  a  family  of  "greenhorns"  saddled  on 
me.  Through  the  mediumof  the  movies,  I  found 
a  wonderful  way  of  quickly  Americanizing 
them.  My  Russian  in-laws  are  now  on  the 
road  to  becoming  real  Americans — thanks  to 
the  movies — a  magic  word,  embodying  an  all- 
round  education. 

Mrs.  Joe  Miller,  Charlotte,  N.  C. 

MORE  THAN  THRICE  BLESSED 

And  what  a  blessed  event  "Blessed  Event" 
turned  out  to  be  for  a  public  surfeited  with  a 
cycle  of  columnist  stories  that  were  borim:  in 
their  similarity.  It  is  real  entertainment — 
clever  dialogue,  splendid-cast,  all  directed  with 
a  master  hand. 

J i:\.v\ette  B.  Stein,  Ottumwa,  Iowa 


Orchids  to  Mrs.  Tracy's  little  boy,  Lee,  for 
his  work  in  "Blessed  Event."  And  want 
Ruth  Donnelly  great?  I  don't  know  whin  I 
enjoyed  a  picture  as  much  as  this,  and  cer- 
tainly recommend  it  to  diversion  seekers.  Add 
treats:  Getting  a  glimpse  of  our  Mary  Brian) 
again,  solemn-faced  Ned  Sparks,  and  that  oh  so 
handsome  newcomer,  Dick  Powell.  Say,  what 
more  do  you  want  for  your  money?

KEEPING  UP  WITH  THE  WORLD 

A  few  years  ago  I  realized  my  husband  had 
succeeded  in  his  profession;  our  children  had 
college  educations  and  were  holding  good  posi- 
tions— and  all  were  advancing  in  other  ways. 
I  had  fallen  sadly  behind  and  now  it  was  up  to 
me  to  catch  up. 

I  found  no  better  medium  for  obtaining  all- 
round,  broad-minded,  up-to-the-minute  in- 
formation than  at  the  movies.  Some  pictures 
are  poor,  some  silly — but  so  are  some  people, 
some  books.  Such  is  life! 
Mrs.  Grace  A.  Ciiapix,  Kansas  City,  Mo. 

THE  LAD'S  TECHNIQUE  IS  GOOD 

Of  all  the  pictures  I  have  seen  recently,  "One 
Way  Passage"  impressed  me  as  being  different 
in  every  way.  The  story  is  an  entirely  new  one. 
The  acting  is  superb  from  the  main  roles  to  the 
least  important  one.  Direction,  photography. 
settings  and  scenery  are  all  perfect.  Pill 
Powell's  love-making  was  the  cleanest  and 
sweetest  I  have  seen  on  the  screen  for  ages. 
Eleaxore  G.  Marciiaxd,  Salem,  Mass. 

MORE  ABOUT  MOVIE  MORALS 

For  eighteen  years  I've  been  a  movie  fan — 
and  no  piker  at  it  either — but  it's  beginning  to 
look  as  if  the  movies  and  I  are  coming  to  the 
parting  of  the  ways,  and  coming  fast. 

In  days  past,  when  anyone  would  remark  to 
me,  "The  movies  are  sexy,"  I  always  retorted, 
"  I  don't  go  to  see  that  kind."  But  that  answer 
doesn't  go  any  more.  That's  about  the  only 
kind  there  is  now.  I'm  getting  fed  up  on  roues 
for  heroes  and  demi-mondes  for  heroines. 

I'm  no  saint  myself,  but  I'd  be  considerably 
upset  if  I  thought  my  morals  were  one-tenth 
as  bad  as  those  of  the  characters  I  see  on  the 
screen.

FROM  EAST  OF  SUEZ 

I  live  in  Sourabaya,  one  of  the  bigger  towns 
in  the  Dutch  East  Indies.  When  I  was  still 
living  in  Holland  I  always  loved  the  movies, 
and  I  wondered  what  I  was  going  to  see  of  them 
on  the  other  side  of  the  world.  Imagine  my 
astonishment  when  I  looked  upon  the  big,  cool 
theaters  here.  And  the  best  of  films!  I  now 
know  that  pictures  are  the  most  important 
recreation,  for  it  very  seldom  occurs  that  good 
stage  actors  pay  a  visit  to  these  tropical 
regions. 

On  my  first  visits  to  the  movies  it  struck  me 
how  the  natives  enjoyed  the  pictures.  They 
are  a  fine  audience.  If  they  appreciate  a  film 
they  show  their  appreciation  by  clapping  their 
hands  and  cheering  the  cast.  They  do  not 
understand  a  syllable  of  the  spoken  word,  for 
they  speak  only  their  own  Javanese  or  Malay 
language. 

Most  of  the  scenes  are  laid  in  a  world  which 
is  absolutely  unknown  to  them,  but  in  spite 
of  all  this  they  enjoy  the  movies  like  nothing 
else.

Red,  rough  hands 

Made  smooth  ami  lovew 

...in  3  days 

rainful  chapping  instantly  relieved 


Stunning  at  a  distance.  But  when  they  saw  her  hands 
— what  a  shock!  So  red,  so  rough  and  cracked 
they  made  her  look  like  a  scrubwoman  dressed  up ! 

How  could  she  be  so  careless!  Just  a  few  min- 
utes would  have  saved  her.  A  few  minutes  spent 
in  smoothing  on  a  dainty,  gossamer-fine,  hand 
cream  that  quickly  softens  ugly,  red  roughness  to 
smooth,  porcelain-white  loveliness.  Wonderful  for 
chapping — instantly  draws  out  smarting,  stinging 
soreness.  Thousands  of  housewives,  business 
women,  sportswomen — active,  outdoor-loving 
youngsters,  too — keep  hands  soft  and  smooth  with 
Hinds  Honey  and  Almond  Cream. 

When  you  do  housework,  your  hands  are  in  and 
out  of  water  continually — often  hot  water  contain- 
ing harsh,  alkali  cleaners.  This  constant  wetting, 
especially  in  winter,  dries  out  the  natural  beauty 
oils  in  the  skin.  Hinds  puts  back  these  precious  oils— 
quickly  restores  youthful  softness  and  smoothness. 

Try  Hinds — note  its  chiffon  texture 

Smooth  on  a  few  drops  of  this  delicate  cream.  And 
smarting  stops,  dryness  goes  —  roughness  softens. 
For  three  days  continue  to  use  Hinds  regularly,  espe- 
cially at  night.  On  the  third  day  hands  should  be 
soft,  white,  satin-smooth — not  a  hint  of  housework. 
Hinds  is  a.  joy  to  use.  A  chiffon-weight  cream — 
not  a  weak,  thinned-out  lotion  or  a  thick,  gummy 
jelly.  Beware  of  these  imitations  which  may  contain 
excessive  drying  substances  that  also  dry  the  hands! 
Hinds  soothes  and  heals,  leaves  an  invisible  "sec- 
ond skin"  that  acts  as  a  constant  protection.

GOLDEN  MOUNTAINS— Amkino.— A  tedious

explain  what  little  action  there  is.      (June)

love  story  taken  from  an  island  of  Bali  legend.  All 
native  cast.    (Sept.) 

GUILTY  AS  HELL— Paramount.— Mystery  with

sparkling  friendly-enemies  team  of  Edmund  Lowe 
and  Victor  McLaglen.     (Oct.) 

•     HAT  CHECK  GIRL— Fox.— You'll  like  this.

HELL'S  HIGHWAY— RKO-Radio.—  Richard  Dix

HOLLYWOOD  SPEAKS— Columbia.— Not  in 
the  running  with  all  the  good,  true-to-life  pictures

fairly  gay  film  that  tries  to  be  smarter  than  it  is.

sheer  old  age.      (Nov.)

the  last  chapter.      (A  ug.) 

LENA  RIVERS— Tiffany  Prod.— There  are  tradi- 
tions in  old  Kentucky,  suh !  But  this  race  horse  story

•  LETTY  LYNTON— M-G-M.— A  gripping  tale 
with  Joan  Crawford  at  her  best,  as  Leily.  Nils 
Asther  is  a  fascinating  villain  and  Robert  Montgom- 
ery gives  a  skilful  performance.  The  direction,  plus 
a  strong  cast,  make  this  picture  well  worth  seeing. 
(June) 

•  LIFE  BEGINS — First  National. — Unusual 
story,  laid  in  a  maternity  ward  where  life 
begins  and  sometimes  ends  cruelly.  Relieved  by

Eric  Linden,  Aline  MacMahon  and  Loretta  Young 
head  a  fine  cast.    (Oct.) 

LOVE  BOUND — Peerless  Prod. — A  slow,  ponder-

brides,  grooms  and  stolen  pearls.     (Sept.) 

LOVE  IS  A  RACKET— First  National.— Doug 
Fairbanks.  Jr.,  as  a  chatter  columnist.  Good  work  by 
Doug,  Frances  Dee  and  Ann  Dvorak,  but  the  story  is 
weak.     (July) 


•  LOVE  ME  TONIGHT— Paramount— All 
through  this  riot  of  entertainment  and  catchy 
music  you  have  zat  naughty  Chevalier,  to  say  nothing

plot  whether  or  not  you  know  German.     (July) 

MADAME  RACKETEER— Paramount.— Alison 
Skipworth  as  a  crook  who  poses  as  a  countess,  gives

Prod. — German  language  film  with  English  sub- 
title?, about  a  Prussian  school  for  girls  and  the  effect

lives.     Expertly  directed  and  acted.     (Nov.) 

•  MAKE  ME  A  STAR— Paramount.— Magni- 
ficent blending  of  laughs,  tears  and  Hollywood 
studio  secrets.  Stuart  Erwin  and  Joan  Blondell  are

and  Karen  Morley  seem  wasted  in  an  implausible 
story.     (July) 

MAN  CALLED  BACK,  THE  —  Tiffany.  —  That 
old  plot  about  the  doctor  who  fumbled  an  important 
operation  is  all  dressed  up  with  a  murder  trial  at  the 
end.      (Sept.) 

MAN  FROM  HELL'S  EDGES— World  Wide.— 
Gun  play,  flying  fists  and  fast  horsemanship  in  this 
Bob  Steele  Western.     (A  ug.)

beauty"  Westerns.     (July)

•     MERRILY  WE  GO  TO  HELL— Paramount.

drunkard,  and  you'll  like  Sylvia  Sidney.     (Aug.)

IT'S  POSITIVELY  *^k    UNCANNY /" 

'    v       fi 


An  electric  bridge 

1 9,  L)  1 6  *^a*  s^uffles  and  deals 


It  astonishes.  It  mystifies.  It  flabber- 
gasts. Tournament-  scarred  veterans 
pale,  strongmen  faint,  when  first  they 
behold 'what  modern  science  has  brought 
to  bridge — Hammond's  new  Electric 
Bridge  Table,  which  shuffles  and  deals 
cards  without  benefit  of  human  hands. 

It  eliminates  the  manual  shuffle.  Elim- 
inates the  manual  deal.  Never  exposes 
a  card.  Never  spills  one  on  the  floor. 
Always  comes  out  even.  And  forever 
shushes  that  scathing  rebuke,  "  Can  we 
get  you  a  basket?" 

It  sounds  magical — but  it's  electrical. 

You  still  bid,  you  still  play,  you  still  keep 
score.  The  Hammond  Electric  Bridge 


of  the  pocket  in  front  of  him  the  hand 
that  has  already  been  shuffled  and  dealt 
while  you've  been  playing  the  other 
deck — and  keeps  right  on  going! 


Slip  in  the  deck.  That  starts  the  automatic, 
scientific  shuffling  and  dealing.  While  you 
play  one  hand,  the  next  is  being  made  ready 


Table  does  the  rest!  After  the  hand, 
slip  the  deck  into  the  shuffle-box  on  the 
side  of  the  table.   Each  player  picks  out 


Made  and  guaranteed  by  The 
Hammond  Clock  Company  of 
Chicago,  who  also  make  Amer- 
ica's finest  Bichronous  and  Syn- 
chronous electric  clocks — for  exam- 
ple, the  popular  Glenmora  Model 
at  $27.50— tax  paid 


Here's  your  new  hand !  The  Hammond  Elec- 
tric Bridge  Table  deals  it  into  a  pocket  in  the 
side  of  the  table— one  in  front  of  each  player 


— and  while  you're  playing  that  one,  the 
deck  you've  just  inserted  in  the  shuffler 
is  miraculously  being  shuffled  and  dealt 
and  will  be  ready! 

This  is  something  very,  very  new — and 
a  boon  to  serious-minded  bridge  players 
to  whom  shuffling  and  dealing  is  a  pain 
in  the  hand. 

And  on  the  other  hand,  the  Hammond 
Electric  Bridge  Table  is  good-looking 
as  well  as  useful.  The  table  itself,  reg- 
ulation size,  is  finished  in  walnut.  The 
legs  are  sturdy  enough  to  resist  even  the 
weight  of  fat  Mr.  Whoosis  whose  host- 
ess-panicking trick  is  to  lean  his  whole 
self  on  a  table  and  ponder  his  cards.  It's 


handsomely  finished  and  the  padded  top 
is  a  pleasure  to  play  on. 

The  top  lifts  off — awed  onlookers  can 
watch  the     works"  at  work. 

It  plays  no  favorites,  working  just  as  well 
for  the  disciples  of  the  Approach- Forc- 
ing system  or  the  One-Two-Three,  as 
it  does  for  the  converts  of  the  One- 
over-One. 

Be  the  first  in  your  Bridge  Club,  Four- 
some, or  neighborhood  to  spring  a  new 
Hammond  Electric  Bridge  Table.  It's 
yours  for  the  modest  sum  of  $25.  A 
more  de  luxe  model  sells  for  $40.  Hand 
yourself  a  thrill.  See  a  demonstration 
at  any  high-class  store  where  the  newest 
in  such  things  are  sold.

Lilyan  Tashman  in  person!  This  charming  actress,  who 
won  applause  in  "The  Wiser  Sex"  (Paramount)  and 
"Those  We  Love"  (World  Wide),  adds  to  her  other 
distinctions  the  reputation  of  being  one  of  the  best- 
dressed  stars  in  the  twinkling  Hollywood  firmament.

A    FAN    LETTER 


The  folloiving  letter  is  typical  of  thousands  received  each 
week  by  such  stars  as  Lilyan  Tashman.  We  believe  her 
answer  will  be  interesting  to  thousands  of  women  everywhere. 

HERE  IS  THE  LETTER 

JJear  Jniss  X^asiiman: 

You  were  just  marvelous  in  "Those  We  Love," and  it  is  easy  to  see 
why  you  are  considered  one  of  the  smartest  dressed  women  on  the 
screen.  As  I  am  a  stenographer  making  only  $l  8.50  a  week,  of  course 
I  cannot  afford  expensive  clothes.  But  I  do  like  to  dress  as  nicely  as  I 
can.  Would  it  be  too  much  trouble  for  you  to  advise  me  a  few  little 
ways,  that  don't  cost  too  much,  how  I  can  make  myself  smarter?  I  am  a 
blonde,  too,  and  am  five  feet,  four  inches  tall,  weighing  108  pounds. 

I  look  forward  to  all  your  pictures— never  miss  one! 

Sincerely,  E.  R.  S. 

HERE   IS  THE  ANSWER 
Jtti]  Dear: 

I'm  very  glad  that  you  enjoyed  my  picture  so  much  that  you 
felt  like  writing  me  about  it — and  about  clothes! 

It  does  not  take  much  money  these  days  to  be  a  "well-dressed 
girl."  Just  choose  the  colors  and  styles  that  become  you  best. 

Another  thing,  be  very  careful  of  your  accessories/ 

Handbags,  shoes,  hats,  jewelry,  and  stockings— with  a  lot  of 
emphasis  on  stockings— are  tremendously  important.  They  can  make  an 
inexpensive  dress  look  like  a  million — or  ruin  even  the  most  expensive. 

Wear  good  stockings — anyone  can  afford  them  these  days. 
Be  sure  they  fit  snugly  and  keep  them  straight  on  the  leg.   And  half  the 
battle  of  dressing  neatly  and  attractively  is  won.   New  shades  I  like, 
and  which  you  should  be  able  to  wear,  are    Taupe-Mist,'    'Interlude 
and  "Rhumtone."  p.i        a*~    i 

WE  AGREE  WITH   MISS  TASHMAN 


". . .  stockings  are  tremendously  im- 
portant.  . .  "  Any  fashion  expert  will 
tell  you  just  how  important  they  are. 
And  if  you  wear  Realsilk  stockings, 
you  can  be  sure  that  they're  the  latest 
in  style  because  Realsilk  permanently 
maintains  for  fashion  authenticity  a 
famous  Fashion  Committee. 
". . .  wear  good  stockings . . . "  Surely, 
there's  no  reason  for  any  woman  to 
deny  herself  the  pleasure  and  confi- 
dence of  fine  hosiery  with  Realsilk 
offering  such  beautiful  qualities  at 
such  remarkably  low,  1932  prices. 
"...  sure  they  fit  snugly. . .  "  With 
Realsilk  you  can  be  sure,  because  this 
famous  brand  of  hosiery  is  always 


made  of  fresher  silk.  Fresher  silk  means 
more  elasticity,  greater  durability  and 
longer  wear — as  well  as  better  ap- 
pearance. (Realsilk  because  it  sells 
direct  from  the  mills  to  you,  can  and 
does  give  yon  fresher  silk.) 
''. . .  keep  them  straight  on  the  I  eg. .." 
And  because  Realsilk  has  a  feature  of 
construction  found  i  n  no  other  stock- 
ings, it's  easy  to  keep  them  straight 
on  the  leg.  We've  found  a  new  way 
to  close  up  the  useless  hole  inside  the 
hem,  thus  enabling  you  to  fasten 
garters  right  on  the  seam.  That 
keeps  them  straight — and  it's  just  one 
of  seven  extra  and  exclusive  features 
in  Realsilk. 


Realsilk  sells  only  through  representatives  who  call  at  home  or  office.  If  you 
are  not  being  called  upon  regularly,  just  telephone  your  local  Realsilk 
Branch  (located  in  200  leading  cities)  and  ask  that  a  representative  be  sent 
out.  The  phone  number  is  listed  under  "Realsilk".  Realsilk  Hosiery  Mills, 
Inc.,  Indianapolis,  Indiana.  World's  Largest  Manufacturers  of  Silk  Hosiery. 


WE  just  had  to  print  this  stunning  and  unusual  photograph  of  Con' 
stance  Bennett,  but  what  is  there  to  tell  about  her  that  you  don't 
know?  Weary  of  personal  publicity,  she  is  fighting  hard  for  a  "private 
life."  The  retakes  on  "Rockabye"  finished  and  her  European  trip 
postponed,  she  goes  into  her  next  production  after  a  brief  vacation

HERE'S  one  of  the  busiest  of  the  younger  Hollywood  actresses. 
Loretta  Young  dashes  from  picture  to  picture,  so  it's  nice  to  get  a 
portrait  like  this  to  prove  that  she  does  have  time  occasionally  to  sit 
down  and  reflect  about  it  all.  You'll  see  her  next  in  "Employees'  En- 
trance," the  film  in  which  Alice  White  makes  her  screen  comeback

ANOTHER  thoughtful  young  screen  star.  Bret  Harte's  "Salomy 
Jane,"  made  into  the  Fox  picture,  "Wild  Girl,"  gives  Joan  Bennett 
her  latest  role.  Mother  of  an  almost-five-year-old  daughter,  Adrienne, 
by  a  former  marriage;  now  wife  of  Gene  Markey,  the  writer,  this 
youngest  Bennett  manages  to  have  an  important  career  of  her  own

Tin  fighting  this  Nonsense 
about  Sweets 


SAYS 


SYLVIA 


Hollywood's  [union*  slenderizing  authority 


\\  h\    LIFE  SAVERS  help  you 
grow  thin  .  .  .  and  stay  thin! 


Not  long  ago  I  got  fighting  mad.  A  woman 
came  t<>  me  to  take  off  some  of  the  "lard" 
she  was  toting  around.  I  get  $100  a  half 
hour  for  that.  And  I've  got  so  many  pic- 
Mire,  stage  and  social  celebrities  to  take 
■are  of,  I'm  pretty  pressed  for  time. 

She  started  to  take  up  a  lot  of  it  arguing 
with  me  .  .  .  imagine  that! . . .  when  I  told 
her  she  had  to  eat  enough  sugar  to  reduce. 
Another  victim  of  that  old  nonsense  that 
you  have  to  starve  yourself  on  sugar  when 
you  are  reducing.   Did  I  burn  up! 

1  told  you  I  get  $100  a  half  hour.  Well, 
I'm  going  to  tell  you  what  I  do  to  earn  it. 
(live  you  the  main  points  in  my  advice: 

FI RST :  Exercise  sanely,  preferably  a  two 
or  three  mile  walk  a  day  in  the  open  air.

-tar.  featured  in  "\  Chanel  at   Heaven" 


SECOND:  Cut  out  heavy,  fat  foods, 
gravies,  rich  sauces  and  liquor,  absolutely! 

THIRD:  (And  this  is  vital!)  Eat  enough 
sugar!  No,  that's  not  a  misprint.  I  mean 
it  exactly  .  .  .  don't  starve  yourself  on 
sweets.  That's  the  old  idea.  Forget  it. 

Don't  starve  yourself  on  sugar.  It's  the 
one  food  element  that  burns  up  the  body 
fats.  The  fire  of  burning  sugar  in  your 
system  "melts  away"  the  excess  pounds. 
Fat  is  like  fuel;  sugar  like  flame. 

The  right  sweet  at  the  right  time  is  as  im- 
portant as  exercise,  or  anything  else  I've 
told  you  to  do.  Life  Savers  are  a  purpose- 
ful candy  for  my  slenderizing  program. 
I  give  them  because  they  provide  the 
quickly  assimilated  sugar  energy  you 
need,  without  any  fat-forming  extra  bulk. 

They  are  hard,  so  you  let  them  dissolve 
on  your  tongue.  Each  Life  Saver  lasts  8 
to  10  minutes.  So  I'm  not  just  giving  you 
a  temporary  taste  pleasure  but  a  lasting 
gratification  of  your  craving  for  sugar.

Close-Ups  and  Long-Shots 


AND  what  now  do  you  suppose  is  the  only 
barrier  between  us  and  the  innocence  that 
mantled  Adam  and  Eve  in  the  Garden  of 
Eden?  Those  pernicious  motion  pictures!  What, 
again?    Yes,  sure 'nough  ! 

Well,  invention  is  running  kind  of  low  these  days, 
and  new  ideas  are  scarce.  Maybe  it's  the  depression, 
but  motion  pictures — my  word! — why,  they  used  to 
pick  on  them  when  I  was  little  more  than  a  child! 
Who  said  the  world  moves? 


YET  it  must  be  true;  it's  all  here  in  black  and 
white.  A  woman's  magazine,  conducting  an  "in- 
vestigation," has  made  these  startling  "discoveries": 

Sixty-two  per  cent  among  4,58  high  school  boys  and 
girls  admitted  that  they  imitated  the  dress  and  man- 
nerisms of  screen  stars. 

Thirty-three  per  cent  of  the  same  grovip  said  that 
love  techniques  shown  on  the  screen  had  inspired  them 
to  emulation  (not  always  successful). 

Sixty-six  per  cent  remembered  that  they  had  dwelt 
in  a  world  of  fantasy;  prolonged  hours  of  day-dream- 
ing had  come  to  them  as  a  result  of  the  movies. 

Twenty-two  per  cent  had  become  dissatisfied  with 
home  and  its  limitations  because  of  the  splendors 
shown  on  the  silver  screen. 


RECALL  the  pre-movie  days,  when  boys  learned 
filthy  language  and  filthier  thinking  in  the  cheap 
pool  room  and  the  low  burlesque  theater. 

You  won't  find  youth  congregating  in  any  such  spots 
of  moral  pestilence  today.  They  have  found  in 
motion  pictures  a  form  of  entertainment  that  raises 
their  imagination  and  their  thoughts  to  higher  levels, 
and  discovers  for  them  a  more  natural  and  better  out- 
let for  their  emotions.  Would  it  be  possible  for  the 
detractors  of  motion  pictures  even  to  imagine,  much 
less  to  create,  as  educating,  as  broadening  a  form  of 
entertainment? 

These  "investigators"  think  they  are  criticizing 
motion  pictures.  Whereas,  they  are  really  criticizing 
life  itself. 


TWO  big  moments  of  the  month: 
Jimmy  Cagney  and  Alice  White  return  (sepa- 
rately) to  the  lot.  Jimmy,  audacious  insurrecto,  is  one 
of  the  few  in  pictures  who  have  walked  out  and  walked 
right  back  again. 

It  usually  fares  hard  with  these  rebels.  Jimmy's 
triumphant  return  proves  that  he  is  recognized  as  star 
material  of  the  first  water.  The  producers,  having 
weighed  discipline  against  box-office,  succumbed  to 
the  latter. 


AND  what's  the  answer  to  all  that?  Just  this: 
That  youth  has  always  been,  and  always  will 
be,  imitative;  that  we  can  see  no  harm,  but  positive 
good,  in  being  influenced  by  the  better  dress,  the 
better  grooming,  the  better  manners  that  are  por- 
trayed on  the  screen. 

That  if  there  were  no  screen  love-making  to  observe, 
that  youth,  nevertheless,  would  discover  its  own — 
perhaps  a  less  romantic,  less  idealistic  sort. 

That  youth  always  does  live  in  a  world  of  fantasy 
and  that  the  basis  of  that  fantasy  is  to  be  found  in 
every  poem,  every  novel,  or  in  its  own  natural  im- 
pulses. 

That  youth's  dissatisfaction  with  existing  condi- 
tions has  always  been  both  a  problem  and  a  blessing — 
that  this  dissatisfaction  may  be  born  in  observing  a 
more  prosperous  neighbor,  a  better  dressed  girl  at 
school,  in  glimpsing  through  the  windows  of  the  limited 
express  the  luxury  within. 


ALICE  WHITE'S  case  is  quite  different.  One  of 
those  saucy  little  minxes  that  delight  in  tearing 
off  the  tawdry  robes  of  dignity,  she  refused  to  bow 
down  before  tinsel  gods.  That's  treason  in  the  king- 
dom of  Hollywood,  where  few  monarchs,  male  or 
feminine,  ever  feel  quite  secure  on  their  thrones.  The 
cry  went  up  "Banish  Alice!"  And  banished  she  was. 

But  her  loyal  subjects  throughout  the  land  clamored 
for  her  return.  And  so  once  more  Alice  treads  the 
studios.  Or  to  put  it  in  plain  low-down,  Alice  filled 
the  theaters  on  her  vaudeville  tour,  and  the  producers 
asked  her  to  come  home. 

Just  a  case  of  dollars  versus  dignity,  and  dollars 
won. 


PERSONALITIES  still  crowd  them  in.    And  stars 
continue  in  the  ascendant.      It   would  be  rather 
difficult    to   imagine    Garbo's   losing   her 


popularity 

25 


through  appearing  in  even  a  series  of  poor  pictures. 

When  Shakespeare  wrote,  "The  play's  tin*  thing," 
he  hadn't  in  mind  1!):5\>  motion  pictures. 

Other  generations  wenl  to  the  theater  to  see  Booth 
as  Othello;  Mansfield  as  Cyrano  and  Bernhardt  as 
Camille. 

Hut  we  go  to  see  Garbo  as  Garbo. 

Interpretations  don't  mean  so  much  to  us.  Even 
George  Arliss'  characterizations  do  not  impress  like 
the  man  himself.  And  whether  he  plays  a  Hindu 
rajah,  a^  in  "The  Green  Goddess,"  or  Disraeli,  Arliss  is 
pretty  much  himself — the  same  gestures,  the  same  sly 
look  of  the  eye  when  he  delivers  a  telling  line,  the  same 
facial  expressions  for  similar  emotional  import. 

A  great  technician,  it  is  true,  but,  withal,  George 
Arliss.     And  George  Arliss  is  what  we  want. 


AUDIENCES  were  not  prepared  for  some  of 
Clark  Gable's  recent  roles.  They  didn't  come  to 
"Strange  Interlude"  for  a  characterization  of  Ned 
Darrell. 

They  wanted  to  see  Gable,  the  man.  They  didn't, 
and,  therefore,  were  disappointed. 

Jean  Hersholt,  Paul  Muni,  Gregory  Ratoff  give 
grand  and  unusual  interpretations.  The  public  likes 
them,  but  their  popularity  is  not  extraordinary. 

Even  Marie  Dressier,  great  actress  that  she  is, 
largely  plays  herself. 

Joan  Crawford's  allure  and  dash;  Janet  Gaynor's 
semi-childish  wistfulness — that's  what  makes  them 
perennial  favorites. 


SOMETIMES  an  unknown  star  is  thrust  up  for  our 
approval,  but  unless  he  or  she  has  a  distinctive 
personality,  one  that  can  be  trade-marked,  the  new- 
comer— heaven  help  him  or  her — will  vanish  with  the 
velocity  of  a  retreating  comet. 

You  can't  consistently  imagine  Robert  Mont- 
gomery as  a  beggar,  or  Will  Rogers  as  a  Beau 
Brummell.  If  you  can,  you  are  living  in  a  world  of 
unreality. 

A  personality  once  typed  must  stay  put.  It  is  the 
edict  of  the  public  and  from  that  there  is  no  appeal. 
Xot  the  show,  but  the  stars  must  go  on. 


THE  way  the  youngsters  in  Hollywood  are  picking 
1 1 1 >  the  torch  dropped  by  their  fathers  is  enough  to 
bring  a  lump  in  any  throat.  There's  Rin-Tin-Tin,  Jr., 
who  is  striving  in  his  dogged  way  to  fill  the  niche  left 
vacant  by  his  famous  sire. 

And  now  that  Tom  Mix  is  retiring  his  faithful  horse 
Tony,  Tony  Jr.  is  to  follow  in  his  dad's  hoof-prints. 
Will  good  old  Tony's  generous  pension  of  oats  com- 
pensate him  for  wistful  memories  of  many  a  thrilling 
dash  after  cattle  thieves  and  oilier  dastardly  villains? 

The  four-footed  stars  must  yield  to  the  passage  of 
time  even  as  human  screen  idols  must  give  way  to  the 
greater  glamour  of  a  younger  generation. 

26  - 


NOT  one  of  the  winners  of  PHOTOPLAY'S  Gold 
Medal  since  1920 — when  that  award  was  first 
made  -could,  by  any  twisting  of  the  meaning  of  the 
word,  be  called  a  sex  picture. 

You  may  snuggle  up  to  your  boy  friend  in  the  semi- 
gloom  of  the  movie  theater  when  witnessing  a  love 
scene.     But  that's  something  else.     That \s  romance. 


SUCH  a  picture  as  "Grand  Hotel"  depends  for  its 
success  but  little  upon  the  lure  of  the  flesh.  Its 
galaxy  of  gallant  troupers  do  the  trick.  The  half- 
dozen  stars  of  the  first  magnitude,  not  to  mention 
several  minor  ones,  would  almost  inevitably  make  any 
film  an  outstanding  success. 

Certainly  the  mercenary  relationship  between 
Preys-ing  (Wallace  Beery)  and  Flaemtnchen  (Joan 
(  rawford)  would  never  lift  this  story  to  the  heights  of 
popularity  it  has  attained.  But  the  love  affair 
between  the  Baron  (John  Barrymore)  and  Gruainskaya 
(Greta  Garbo)  is  an  interest  of  another  sort.  It  repre- 
sents the  greatest  interest  of  any  normal  human  being 
— romance.  The  public  takes  to  sex  in  a  big  way  only 
when  it  is  purified  by  idealism. 


THERE  was  a  racing  story  waiting  to  be  made 
when  Wally  Reid  died.  And  that  picture  was 
never  made.  But  now,  after  these  years,  they  have 
found  someone  who  can  do  it.  His  name  is  William 
Wallace  Reid.  Wally's  son,  now  a  young  man  in  his 
teens. 

And  to  add  to  the  drama  of  this  situation,  the 
director  is  Jerome  Storm,  who  was  a  big  director  when 
Wally  was  at  the  height  of  his  career.  Storm  dropped 
to  the  status  of  an  extra  and  then  a  doorman  on  one  of 
the  studio  sound  stages.  Xow  another  chance  conies 
for  him. 

Real  life  drama,  isn't  it? 


BUSY  Hollywood  has  solved  another  problem. 
They  will  let  their  children  uphold  the  social 
obligations  of  the  family.  While  the  mothers  and 
fathers  make  the  money,  the  little  sons  and  daughters 
can  spend  it. 

There's  an  absolute  epidemic  of  youngsters'  parties. 

Helen  Hayes  complains  because  neither  she  nor 
hubby  Charlie  Mac-Arthur  can  have  the  big  limousine. 
Their  child  always  has  it — and  the  chauffeur,  too. 

Incidentally,  these  young  folks  are  setting  the 
fashions.  Each  one  must  outdo  the  other.  Mania 
Hayes,  for  example,  keeps  her  youngster  gowned  in 
the  mode  of  the  gay  nineties.  Lace  mits  (real  lace,  of 
course!),  smocked  gowns  and  bonnets.     Yes.  bonnets! 

But  here's  the  most  interesting  part  of  the  story. 
Who  would  have  believed  it?  In  the  old  Hollywood, 
they  hid  their  children  for  fear  someone  would  learn 
they  had  them.  Today,  they  promote  them  to  social 
ambassadors  for  the  family.

Why  Clark  Gable  Says 


i 


There's  a  glowering 
look  in  Clark  Gable's 
eye  as  though  within 
his  heart  he  dissents 
from  the  easy-going 
self  the  studios   see 


HAVE  been  in  the  show  business  for  twelve  years. 
They  have  known  me  in  Hollywood  but  two.  Yet,  as 
picture  making  goes,  two  years  is  a  measurably  long  time. 
Nevertheless,  my  advice  has  never  been  asked  about  a 
part  in  a  picture.  I  have  never  been  consulted  as  to  what  I 
would  like  to  play."  And  smilingly  Clark  Gable  added,  "I 
am  paid  not  to  think." 

This  is  a  bit  reminiscent  of  a  squabble  Ina  Claire  had  with 
Sam  Goldwyn.  Ina  had  proffered  suggestions  while  working 
on  "The  Greeks  Had  a  Word  For  Them."  As  a  producer  herself 
of  plays,  she  felt  that  she  knew  something  about  the  show 
business.  Her  ideas  came  to  Goldwyn's  attention.  He  sent  for 
her  and  said,  "To  let  actors  think  is  too  expensive." 

I  reminded  Clark  of  this  Goldwyn-Claire  controversy,  and 
he  smiled.  "That's  right,"  he  said,  "I  am  not  even  thinking 
about  my  screen  future." 

And  yet  Clark  is  not  one  of  those  lads  who  make  a  success 
in  a  few  pictures  and  then  believe  they  know  more  about  the 
business  than  those  who  have  been  producing  pictures  for 
years;  who  try  to  tell  the  studios  what  to  do  and  how  to  do  it. 

Xo,  Clark  has  never  done  that.  When  he  chose  to  express 
himself,  he  has  done  it  in  a  more  practical  way.  Money. 
When  his  name  became  famous,  he  did  ask  for  a  raise,  but  he 
went  about  the  matter  quietly  and  with  dignity. 

He  knew  that  screen  fame  is  usually  short-lived.  It  could  last 
only  so  long  as  he  might  have  the  proper  parts,  and  he  knew 
he  might  not  be  given  them.  He  was,  therefore,  determined 
to  secure  as  big  a  stake  for  his  future  as  possible.  He  demanded 
more  money  than  the  starting  salary  on  which  he  had  been 
signed.  He  demanded  it  just  after  he  had  begun  work  on 
"Polly  of  the  Circus."  The  psychological  moment!  They 
couldn't  finish  the  picture  without  him. 

28 


By  Ruth 
B  i  e  r  y 


To  demand  more  money  was  but  to  demand  protection  for 
the  future — a  protection  to  which  every  man  who  works  is 
entitled. 

When  I  asked  him  why  he  doesn't  volunteer  suggestions  for 
plays  which  he  would  like  to  do,  he  answered,  "I  just  work 
here.    I  try  to  work  well  and  hard." 

"But  if  you  have  good  ideas,  Clark — " 

He  interrupted.  "I  haven't  any  more  to  lose  than  they 
have.  After  all,  they  have  an  investment  in  me.  They've 
spent  money  on  me.  It's  my  business  to  work;  not  to  think. 
I  do  my  work  without  talking." 

Yet  Clark  knows  what  "Polly  of  the  Circus"  and  "Strange 
Interlude"  have  done  for  him.  He  knows  he  was  close  to  the 
summit  when  "Possessed"  was  released.  And  he  knows  that 
those  first  two — to  which  he  was  photographically  unfitted — 
gave  him  a  push  backwards  from  which  it  may  take  time  and 
exceptionally  well-suited  pictures  to  recover. 

HE  also  understands,  as  few  do,  the  secret  of  picture  success. 
He  knows  that  he  might  have  done  "Polly  of  the  Circus" 
and  "Strange  Interlude"  on  the  stage  and  gotten  away  with 
them.  His  twelve  years  of  study  and  experience  have  made  him 
a  versatile  actor — on  the  stage.    But  the  stage  is  not  the  screen. 

To  know  Clark  Gable  in  person  is  to  know  a  swarthy- 
complexioned,  quiet  person  who  says  what  he  has  to  say  in 
terse  sentences  and  an  "I-am-always-myself"  manner.  A 
frequent  twinkle  in  the  eyes;  a  rapid  flash  of  dimples  indicates 
a  well-controlled  sense  of  humor.  A  likable  chap  who  recalls 
dozens  somewhat-like-him  whom  you  have  known  on  the 
college  campus. 

There  is  no  more  suggestion  of  the  gangster  or  "I-always- 
get-my-woman"  type  than  there  was  about  those  others. 


fl  Am  Paid  Not  to  Think 


•>•) 


But  Clark  Gable  on  the  screen! 
Ah!  The  camera  plays  queer  tricks 
with  us. 

It  plays  queer  tricks  with  so 
many.  It  types  its  subjects, 
whether  they  wish  to  be  typed  or 
not.  It  classified  Janet  Gaynor 
so  she  can  never  be  anything  but 
wistful  and  adolescently  appeal- 
ing— no  matter  how  tempted  she 
is,  personally,  to  seek  sophistica- 
tion.      It     has     typed     Marlene 

Dietrich  and  Greta  Garbo.  They  are  sirens  and  must  remain 
such  if  they  are  to  continue  successful.  The  camera  has  so 
dictated. 

You  may  be  as  versatile  as  a  Duse  or  a  Laurence  Barrett 
on  the  stage,  but  in  pictures  you  are  only  as  versatile  as 
the  camera  allows  you  to  be.  You  may  be  absolutely  colorless 
as  a  person,  but  when  you  flash  on  that  screen,  you  may 
radiate  an  individuality  so  powerful  that  you  bless  the  camera. 

Clark  Gable  fully  appreciates  what  the  camera  does  to  him. 
It  metamorphoses  him  from  a  sensible,  independent  young 
man,  who  is  not  so  different  from  hundreds  of  others,  into  the 
modern  feminine  version  of  a  cave  man.  In  "Night  Nurse" 
he  played  a  despicable  character,  one  whom  he  would  hate  in 
real  life.  But  the  camera  made  him  desirable  to  women,  even 
though  despicable. 

In  "Possessed,"  his  favorite  picture,  it  made  him  a  well- 
dressed,  cultured  fellow,  but  one  who  still  slapped  down  his 
women. 

In  "A  Free  Soul" — hardboiled,  "I-take-what-I-want-when- 
I-want-it," 

EACH  of  these  pictures  told  a  story  which  bent  to  the  will  of 
the   camera,   and    allowed  him  parts  for   which   he   was 
camera-fitted. 

But  "Laughing  Sinners,"  "Polly  of  the  Circus"  and  "Strange 
Interlude"!  A  salvation  army  boy  in  the  first.  Clark  re- 
placed Johnny  Mack  Brown  in  that  picture.  They  put  the 
screen  personality  of  Clark  Gable  into  a  part  intended  for  the 
screen  personality  of  Johnny. 

Somebody  besides  Clark  wasn't  thinking. 


He  takes  the  roles  they 
hand  him  without  so  much 
as  a  shrug  of  the  shoulder, 
but  what  effect  have  these 
parts  on  his  screen  career? 


"Strange  Interlude."  I  blamed 
the  make-up  of  Clark  as  an  old 
man  for  much  of  the  censure 
awarded  that  production.  Clark 
doesn't.  He  tells  me  that  they 
took  eighteen  tests  for  that  make- 
up. Tests  average  a  cost  of  two 
hundred    dollars   apiece. 

Metro  expended  thirty-six  hun- 
dred dollars  in  an  earnest  effort 
to  make  Clark  look  a  believable 
old    man.     It   couldn't   be    done 
because  the  camera  wouldn't  allow  it. 

Clark  plays  old  men  convincingly  upon  the  stage.  The 
demon  camera  simply  stuck  its  tongue  in  its  cheek  and  said, 
"  I've  showed  you  what  Clark  Gable  can  do  on  the  screen.  Go 
ahead  and  ruin  him  if  you  wish.  I  won't  budge  an  inch.  He's 
not  to  play  old  men  any  more  than  ministers." 

PERHAPS  there  are  ministers  such  as  Clark  played  with  Mar- 
ion Davies  in  "  Polly  of  the  Circus.  "  But  they  are  exceptions 
and  the  public  does  not  accept  exceptions  in  its  screen  enter- 
tainment. All  the  way  through  that  picture,  I  felt  like  rushing 
to  the  screen,  grabbing  the  clerical  collar,  which  was  throttling 
Clark's  neck,  and  screaming,  "Be  yourself!  Go  and  get  her!" 
Judging  from  the  letters  received,  many  other  women  had  the 
same  inclination. 

Clark  knows  the  reason  he  had  to  play  in  these  pictures  even 
though  he  won't  tell  you  or  me  about  it.  He  only  smiles,  as 
you  imagine  the  sphinx  would  smile,  when  you  say:  "They 
had  to  pass  you  around  among  the  big  feminine  stars  so  each 
one  would  have  you,  didn't  they,  Clark?" 

Leading  men  are  the  most  difficult  problem  for  women  stars. 
Somehow,  they  are  scarcer  in  Hollywood  than  honest  politi- 
cians in  Washington.  A  good  leading  man,  like  Robert  Mont- 
gomery, is  discovered,  plays  a  few  roles  and  is  then  made  a 
star.  It  is  only  natural  that  feminine  stars  pounce  upon  a  new 
man  like  Clark,  especially  when  he  is  already  well-started  to- 
ward becoming  a  sensation. 

Joan  Crawford  and  Connie  Bennett  had  him  first  as  their 
leads.  Then  Norma  Shearer  in  "A  Free  Soul."  Then  Joan 
insisted  that  he  be  given  to  her  for  [  please  turn  to  page  118  ]

A  few  more  such  roles  as  he  played  in  "Polly  of  the  Circus"  and  "Strange  Interlude"  may  retire  Clark 
permanently  to  the  quiet  reflections  of  his  own  fireside.  But  in  "Red  Dust,"  with  Jean  Harlow,  he  is  once 
more  the  same  masterful  personality  that  won  him  feminine  admiration  and  screen  glory  in  "Possessed"

THE  lights  flare  up.  The  picture  is  over.  And  little

with  a  sigh.  "Oh,  to  be  one  of  those  glamorous 
movie  stars.  Gorgeous  creatures  without  a  defect 
in  a  car  load.  They  all  must  have  been  born  perfect," 
she  grumbles. 

But  don't  kid  your  little  red-headed,  freckle-faced  self, 
dear.  Little  Connie  Lovely  up  there  on  that  screen  to- 
night has  had  heartaches  and  obstacles  to  overcome  that 
would  make  your  troubles  look  like  a  buttercup  in  a  circus 
fatman's  button  hole. 

Born  perfect,  indeed!     No  troubles!     No  obstacles  to 
overcome!    Mamie,  my  child,  don't  believe  it.    Let's  run 
down  the  list  of  some  of  those  stars  who 
are  very  pleasing  to  the  eye. 

Take  Constance  Cummings,  now.  She 
was  brought  to  Hollywood  from  a  rather 
mild  but  promising  spot  on  the  New  York 
stage.  Sam  Goldwyn  had  seen  her  and 
believed  she  had  promise,  so  she  was  en- 
gaged to  play  opposite  Ronald  Colman. 
But  Connie  was  uneasy.  Something, 
somewhere,  was  wrong.  She  was  con- 
scious, for  one  thing,  of  the  thick  but 
lovely  accents  all  about  her,  while  she 
twanged  away  with  a  good  old  Middle 
West  twang.  Her  clothes  seemed  to  bring 
out  rather  than  conceal  all  her  bad  points. 
Her  broad  shoulders,  in  particular,  were 
her  despair. 


BUT  she  worked  like  a  dog.  And  was 
thrilled  to  the  core  with  her  big  chance. 

Then  one  night  rehearsal  was  called  for 
eight.  The  actors  sat  waiting.  Nine 
o'clock  came  and  then  ten.  At  eleven 
o'clock  the  director  arrived. 

"No  rehearsal,  "  he  snapped.  The  next 
morning,  they  told  her.  They  had  been 
looking  at  rushes  the  night  before  and.  no 
use,  Connie  wouldn't  do  at  all.  She  was 
out. 

'Member,  Mamie,  the  time  you 


"Tough"  roles  were  ruining 
her  acting.  Now  Wynne 
Gibson  is  conquering  that

yet  Dorothy  Wilson  was  terribly  awkward.

dreamed  and  dreamed  of  the  day  when 
you'd  move  up  from  the  tinware  counter 
to  the  ladies'  step-ins  department?  And 
then  you  got  it?  Oh,  dear  God,  how 
happy  you  were?  The  ladies'  step-ins,  at 
last!  And  all  the  girls  turned  bilious  with 
envy?  And  then  that  very  afternoon  the 
blonde  friend  of  the  floorwalker,  who  knew 
all  about  step-ins  from  A  to  Z,  was  given 
your  place  and  you  went  back  to  the  tin- 
ware? How  crushed  and  wretched  you 
were.  Mamie? 

Well,  that's  how  Connie  Cummings  felt. 
Only  Connie  didn't  have  any  tinware  to 
go  back  to.  And  while  only  the  few  in 
the  Bon  Ton  Emporium  knew  about  your 
disappointment,  all  Hollywood  knew 
about  Connie's  failure. 

She  felt  like  crawling  out  of  the  place 
on  her  hands  and  knees.

The  Hurdles 


Eight  plucky  girls 
who  refused  to  let 
themselves  be  dis- 
qualified in  fortune's 
grueling    contest 


By  Sara   Hamilton 


They  took 
first  film, 
dimming 


But  she  didn't.  No,  she  didn't.  She 
stayed.  And  decided  she'd  be  good  enough 
for  Hollywood.  And  movies.  You  see,  Con- 
nie felt  they  were  right  about  her.  Abso- 
lutely. 

So  she  did  things.  She  practiced  putting 
on  make-up.  She  gathered  poise  just  as  you  gather  berries  in 
Uncle  Casper's  field.  It  was  hard  work  but  she  stuck  to  it. 
Also  she  learned  not  to  look  like  a  wooden  Indian  with  the 
quinsy  when  the  hero  breaks  down  and  reveals  his  burning 
passion.  She  knows  now  how  a  lady  with  a  burning  passion 
person  on  her  hands  really  looks. 

BY  sneaking  into  projection  rooms  and  watching  herself  she 
also  made  the  discovery  that  she  had  to  exaggerate  her  scenes 
in  order  to  make  them  look  more  natural  on  the  screen.  She 
has  that  kind  of  face.  Moreover,  she  learned  to  let  herself  go 
in  certain  scenes.  We  watched  her  in  a  scene  with  George  Raft 
in  "Night  After  Night"  and  realized,  with  a  start,  that  Connie 
Cummings  could  no  more  have  played  that  scene  a  year  ago 
than  Aunt  Hattie.    Even  when  Auntie's  kittenish. 

So  out  of  a  plain  piece  of  material,  pre-shrunk,  Connie  Cum- 
mings alone  fashioned  this  splendid  and  sought-after  young 


And  silk-finished,  appealing  Dor- 
othy Jordan  once  was  lacking  in 
style  or  allure.    Yes,  it's  a  fact! 


actress.  Under  long  term  contract  to 
Columbia.  Playing  in  three  pictures 
at  once.  And  then  just  a  year  or  so 
later,  Connie  returned  to  the  scene  of 
her  first  failure.  United  Artists  had 
brought  her  back  to  play  with  Harold 
Lloyd  in  "  Movie  Crazy.  "  Borrowed 
now  by  Paramount.     Sought  after. 

So  you  see,  Mamie,  there's  one  young 
movie  actress  that  had  obstacles  to 
overcome.  And  plenty  of  them,  too. 
Let's  look  at  others. 

THE  world  literally  gasps  at  the  dry 
ice  beauty  of  Jean  Harlow.     That 
lovely,  seductive  figure.    Wouldn't  you 
trade   two    Coney   Island   dates   with 
Jimmy  for  a  '"figger"  like  that,  Ma- 
mie?   Just  wouldn't  anybody,  though? 
But  Jean  Harlow  didn't  always  have 
that  figure,  Mamie.    Not  always     I'm 
going  to  tell  you  something  that's  never 
been  told  before.     Jean  Harlow  was 
once  a  wretched  little  cripple.  Couldn't 
walk.     Spinal  meningitis,  Mamie.     It 
broke  her  beautiful  little  body.     And  her  heart,  almost.     For 
even  as  a  child  she  knew  the  value  of  beauty. 

But  Jean  determined  to  do  something.  To  fight.  She  exer- 
cised when  it  was  agony  to  move.  Kept  at  it  and  at  it.  Never 
growing  discouraged.  Never  giving  up.  Doing  everything  they 
asked  her  to  do.    And  she  did  it.  didn't  she? 

Maureen  O'Sullivan  had  never  known  want,  the  need  to 
economize  or  save.  Maureen  was  in  pretty  happy  circum- 
stances over  in  Dublin,  Ireland,  when  a  movie  director  offered 
her  a  job  in  Hollywood.  And  Maureen  took  it  just  for  a  lark. 
And  a  change.  So  that's  the  way  she  came  to  Hollywood — 
and  movies.  And  was  in  the  velvet.  Her  very  first  picture 
with  John  McCormack,  great  Irish  tenor,  was  a  big  success  and 
rated  an  opening  at  Grauman's  Chinese  Theater,  with  lights 
and  glamour  everywhere.  Life  was  an  ermine-lined  cinch  to 
Maureen. 

And  then  she  went  on  with  Fox  [  please  turn  to  page  96  ]

A  happy  Hollywood 
couple  who  have  no 
professional  rows  or 
jealousies.  "Busi- 
ness is  business, 
and  marriage  is 
marriage,"  say  Kay 
Francis  and  Ken- 
neth MacKenna 


By 
Kay 

Roberts 


I  RAX  into  Kenneth  MacKenna  the  other  day  and  com- 
menced talking  about  his  wife's  picture. 
He  naively  asked,  '-What  picture?1'' 
"Mercy,   man!     What   do   you   mean?    What   picture! 
Your  wife 

"1  mean— I  did  read  the  name,  but  I've  forgotten  it." 

•You  read  the  name  of  Kay  Francis  MacKenna's  picture — 
Then  that  means — So  you  and  Kay  are — that  is,  I  mean  you 
and  she— Gee,  that's  too  bad!     Glad  to  have  seen  you — " 

I  edged  away.  I  just  had  time  to  reach  the  telegraph  office 
to  make  the  last  moment  news 
for  the  Photoplay  which  was 
going  to  press.  What  a  story! 
Kay  Francis  and  Kenneth 
MacKenna  separated! 

"Hey, wait  a  moment.  Don't 
be  in  such  a  hurry.  I  hadn't 
meant  to  let  the  cat  out  of  the 
bag,  but  since  I've  started  I'd 
better  finish.  You  might  even 
get  the  idea  that  Kay  and  I 
aren't  happy.  The  reason  I 
don't  know  about  Kay's  pic- 
ture is  because  we  never  dis- 
cuss each  other's  work.  She 
never  says  what  she's  doing  or 
tells  what  happened  during  the 
day.  Neither  do  I.  I'd  be  the 
last  person  to  know  about  Kay, 
professionally."  He  stressed 
the  last   word  slightly. 


LUCKY  it  wasn't  the  fly 
season.  My  mouth  was  too 
wide  open.  I'd  thought  I 
had  a  scoop  when  it  sounded 
like  separation.  But  separa- 
tions, after  all,  are  common 
while  if  this  fantastic-sounding 
yarn  was  gospel,  it  was  the 
only  one  of  the  kind  in  the  city! 
My  reporter's  cynical  nose 
sniffed  suspicion.  It  just 
couldn't  be!    But  if  it  were! 

I  recalled  all  the  couples  I 
knew  in  Hollywood;  all  the 
parties  I  had  attended.  I  had 
never  been  to  the  most  inti- 
mate or  to  the  most  heteroge- 
neous "crush"  where  the  con- 


versation had  not  been  pictures — pictures — pictures.  Pictures 
had  always,  as  a  matter  of  course,  been  dished  with  the  soup 
and  the  dessert — even  into  the  early  morning. 

One  common  subject!  It  becomes  thread-worn.  It  is 
patched.  Again,  it  is  thread-worn.  You  can  patch  only  so 
long.  The  entire  fabric  decays  at  last.  I  have  feared  that 
Hollywood  couples  have  believed  marriage  to  be  frazzled  when 
in  reality  there  was  merely  one  thread  of  conversation  between 
them.  I  have  thought  that  they  mistook  the  one  thread  for 
the    entire    fabric!     Evidently    that    is    the    way    Kay   and 

Kenneth  figured — although 
they  made  no  agreement  to 
eliminate  this  weak  thread 
before  they  married.  But 
they  did  make  two  compacts 
akin  to  the  subject. 


The  home  in  Beverly  Hills  where  Kay  and  Kenneth 
live,  love,  squabble  and  "make  up,"  just  like  the 
folks    back    in    Minneapolis    or    Pleasant    Valley 


THEY  do  not  believe  in 
pre-nuptial  promises  as  a 
rule. 

They  are  too  easily  broken. 

The  two  they  made  were: 
1.  Neither  was  to  ask  the  other 
to  attend  a  Hollywood  opening 
no  matter  what  the  picture  or 
who  the  star.  2.  Neither  was 
to  make  a  social  engagement 
without  first  consulting  the 
other. 

That's  what  they  told  me 
when  I  called  on  them  to  learn 
more  about  the  secret  of  their 
happiness. 

The  first  unconsciously  ex- 
posed their  mutual  attitude 
toward  Hollywood  as  a  mar- 
riage bond.  "Openings  are 
ballyhoo;  definite  exploitation 
stunts  for  picture  people  to  be 
seen.  We  believe  in  other 
forms  of  advertisement;  Kav 
had  hers—" 

Kay  interrupted  Kenneth. 
"When  we  go  out  together  we 
do  so  to  have  fun.  I  don't  like 
to  be  grabbed  or  yanked 
around  by  crowds  or  packed 
into  a  lobby  like  the  proverbial 
sardine  so   that   I   can't  even

proved    otherwise

ALICE  WHITE  is  back — back  in  the  movies. 
And  you,  her  loyal  supporters,  who  have  demanded 
to  see  her  again  on  the  screen,  are  alone  responsible 
for  her  return.  That  just  shows  you  what  loyalty, 
backed  by  loud,  clinking  clamor  will  do.  For,  little  Alice 
oozed  right  out  of  the  picture  before  you  were  ready  for  her  to 
vanish.  One  day,  there  she  was.  Monkey-shining  around  on 
the  screen.     The  next  day,  she  wasn't. 

Presently  her  fans  began  peering  behind  Mickey  Mouse 
comedies  and  Fox  news-reels  and  wanting  to  know  where  Alice 
White  was. 

''Oh,  lookee,"  the  producers  would  say,  "here's  a  cute  little 
number.  Now  you  should  forget  Alice  and  like  Mamie.  See 
how  cute  is  Mamie." 

"I  don't  want  Mamie.  I  want  Alice,"  you  obstinately  per- 
sisted.   But  the  producers  weren't  convinced. 

Then  Alice  decided  to  make  a  personal  appearance  tour.  And 
Hollywood  snickered  and  said,  "Well,  another  has-been  takes 
to  the  road.  Now  we'll  see  how  loyal  all  these  Alice  White 
enthusiasts  are.     Now  we'll  see." 

They  looked.     They  saw.     They  gasped! 

For  little  Alice  wowed  them  right  out  of  their  seats.  She 
put  on  an  act  that  required  talent  and  ability,  she  worked 
like  a  little  spaniel,  and  she  clicked.  As  a  matter  of  fact, 
the  sound  of  the  clicking  could  be  heard  clear  to  Hollywood. 

In  Washington,  D.  C,  they  opened  on  a  Saturday.  It  was 
raining  hard.  But  just  the  same,  at  eleven  o'clock  in  the 
morning,  one  thousand  people  stood  in  line  with  the  rain  in 


their  necks,  to  see  Alice  White.  In  Baltimore,  next  to  Jean 
Harlow,  Alice  White  drew  larger  audiences  than  any  other 
motion  picture  star  who  ever  played  that  city.  Boy,  she 
wowed  them! 

Thousands  of  letters  poured  into  the  theaters  where  she 
played,  each  week.  And  each  week  she  gave  a  radio  broad- 
cast, answering  the  questions,  or  as  many  of  them  as  she  could, 
that  had  come  in. 

"And  they  always  wanted  to  know,"  Alice  said,  "when 
Clara  Bow  was  coming  back  and  whether  Jean  Harlow's  hair 
was  natural." 

But  what  she  didn't  tell  was  that  over  three-fourths  of  the 
letters  asked  the  same  old  question,  "Alice,  when  are  you  going 
back  to  the  movies?" 

SHE  made  friends  wherever  she  went.  For  instance,  in  Balti- 
more, there  was  Mickey  Riley.  Just  nine,  Mickey  was,  with 
red  hair  and  a  face  full  of  freckles.  He  owned  a  strange  and 
mangy  animal  that,  upon  close  examination,  turned  out  to  be  a 
dog,  and  Alice  found  them  both  in  the  alley  back  of  the 
theater,  Mickey  puffing  away  at  a  cigarette.  They  became 
friends  to  the  extent  that  Mickey  even  made  passes  at  his 
neck  and  ears  with  a  few  drops  of  water. 

They  had  long  talks  in  her  dressing-room  between  acts  and 
the  result  was  Mickey  gave  up  the  cigarettes.  He  went  with 
her  to  the  station,  he  and  his  dog,  when  she  left.  And  stood 
there  on  the  platform,  a  forlorn  little  figure  from  the  wrong 
side  of  the  tracks,  wiping  his  nose  [please  turn  to  page  108]

THAT  battle  between  Clara  Bow  and 
Thelma  Todd  in  "Call  Her  Savage." 
Well,  it  wasn't  publicity,  boys  and  girls. 
It  was  the  goods. 

The  low-down  is,  that  fight  scene  was 
Thelma's  only  possible  chance  to  steal  a 
scene  from  the  red-head.  If  she  made  it  a 
real  fight — 

A  grab  for  Clara's  hair.  A  fistful  of  red 
tresses. 

Clara  screeched  and  got  a  handful  of  blonde 
in  return.  Each  woman  getting  madder  and 
madder. 

According  to  the  script,  Monroe  Owsley 
was  supposed  to  separate  them.  But  Monroe 
was  paralyzed  by  the  intensity  of  the  storm, 
weaving  before  and  around  him.  Or  perhaps 
he  was  afraid  that  his  hair  might  go  the  way 
of  all  hair. 

Thelma  ended  it.  She  raised  one  knee  and 
landed  it  convincingly  in  Clara's  mid-region. 
Clara  slumped  to  the  ground.    Out. 

It  was  a  long  count  before  stunned 
director  and  helpers  could  jump  to  carry  her 
to  her  "corner." 

"T"VD  you  get  it?"  the  director  screamed 
■^"at  the  cameraman. 

The  latter  gulped  and  nodded.  He  had  been 
too  stunned,  himself,  to  turn  off  the  camera 
motors. 

In  "Call  Her  Savage"  you'll  sec  the  most 
real  feminine  fight  ever  screened,  for  they 
assert  they  are  going  to  leave  in  every  inch  of 
it. 

In  the  old  days,  only  fate  could  have  saved 
Thelma  Todd.  But  this  time  Clara  said,  "For- 
get it.    Let's  finish  the  picture." 

But  Thelma  won't  steal  any  more  scenes 
from  her.  Clara's  poise  hasn't  made  her 
"easy."

How  many  new 
Clara  Bows  are 
there,  anyway?  She 
looks  different  in 
every  one  of  her 
latest  photographs. 
Clara  is  here  chic 
and  self-assured, 
revealing  still 
another  interesting 
personality  in  a 
scene  from  "Call 
Her     Savage" 


A  T  least  Clara's  had  plenty  of  excitement 
in  her  return  to  pictures! 
First,  a  battle  with  a  snake  on  location. 
Then,  the  battle  with  Thelma  Todd. 
And  just  before  we  go  to  print,  the  scene 
with  the  Great  Dane.    The  two  were  supposed 
to  romp  and  play  together.     But  the  Dane 


wouldn't  romp  and  play.  Clara  tweaked  his 
ear  to  encourage  him.  And  the  Dane  snapped, 
grabbed  her  arm  and  broke  the  skin  in  eleven 
places. 

"RROM  London  comes  the  report  that  Gloria

Across  the  waters  in  dear  old  England,  Gloria  Swanson  and  hei 
husband,  Michael  Farmer,  are  working  together  in  the  picture, 
"Perfect  Understanding."    It's  one  of  those  British  society  dramas 


The  Monthly  Broadcast 

of 

Hollywood 
Goings-On/ 


was  the  best  screen  story  ever  written — she'd 
rather  make  it  than  any  she  ever  heard  of. 
She  sold  it  to  Radio  Pictures  with  the  under- 
standing she  was  to  make  it.  She  left — it  was 
handed  to  Connie. 

You  know  about  the  rivalry  between  Connie 
and  Gloria.  It's  not  a  far  stretch  of  imagina- 
tion to  picture  how  tickled  Connie  was  to  get 
a  chance  to  make  Gloria's  pet  story.  That  is — 
at  first.  After  the  picture  was  previewed 
recently  it  was  decided  to  remake  it. 

George  Fitzmaurice,  who  directed  the  first 
effort,  withdrew  and  George  Cukor,  who  made 
Connie's  biggest  hit,  "What  Price  Hollywood," 
did  the  new  one.  Phillips  Holmes,  leading 
man,  had  a  picture  to  do  at  Fox  so  he  wasn't 
available  for  the  second  siege.  Joel  McCrea 
replaced  him. 

There's  little  doubt  that  director  Fitzmaurice 
and  actor  Phil  were  glad  of  an  excuse  to  escape  it. 

HTHAT  little  girl  Paulette  Goddard  is  cer- 

tainly  keeping  the  rumors  buzzing  around

long  way  since  "The 
Birth  of  a  Nation" 


Charlie  Chaplin  and  the  others  that  say  she 
has  not,  and  isn't  going  to,  but  that  Craney 
Gartz,  wealthy  resident  of  Pasadena,  will  be 
the  lucky  fellow. 

To  add  to  the  confusion,  some  of  her  friends 
claim  she  has  confided  to  them  that  it  is 
Charlie,  while  others  equally  intimate,  insist 


But  what  have  we  here?  Can  that  be  Gloria  Swanson?  Yes,  you 
are  right,  it  is.  What  a  change!  A  honeymoon  photo  with  her 
first  husband,  Wallace  Beery.     Farmer  is  her  fourth,  you  know! 


'tis  the  other  way  about.  At  any  rate,  when 
Chaplin  started  her  on  her  airplane  journey 
Eastward,  he  gave  her  a  kiss  that  was  heard 
'round  the  world. 

Since  Paulette  returned,  she  and  Charlie 
have  been  together  more  frequently  than 
ever.  She  spends  much  of  the  time  with  an 
intimate  little  group  at  his  home  or  attending 
the  theater  and  various  sports  affairs  with  him. 

So  whichever  way  things  stand,  you  can't 
complain  we  haven't  prepared  you. 

Vt7HEN  "Red  Dust,"  Jean  Harlow's  first 
film  since  the  tragic  death  of  her  hus- 
band, Paul  Bern,  was  recently  previewed,  just 
before  it  was  flashed  upon  the  screen,  Jean 
stole  quietly  in  wearing  huge  dark  glasses 
and  with  the  collar  of  her  coat  turned  up 
about  her  chin.  It  was  her  first  public 
appearance  since  the  tragedy  and  she  was 
frankly  nervous  and  fearful  of  the  public's 
reaction  to  her  picture.  She  sat  in  a  dark 
corner  in  the  back  row,  stiff  and  straight  on 
the  edge  of  her  chair. 

And  then  the  story  began  and  from  the  first, 
that  audience  was  with  her.  Applauding  her 
first  scene  and  showing  its  interest  and  sym- 
pathy through  every  reel. 

Jean  relaxed  and  sat  back  with  a  relieved 
sigh.  It  was  something  she  had  dreaded  for 
weeks.  And  now  another  ordeal  in  this 
young  woman's  life  had  been  successfully 
passed. 

U  ETRO-GOLD WYN-M  AYER  has  another 
story  ready  for  her,  and  Jean  is  glad  of  it. 
She  wants  to  work,  for  that  is  the  only  way 
she  can  forget. 

That  sixty-thousand-dollar  home,  which 
Paul  Bern  built  and  gave  to  her  upon  their 
wedding  eve,  is  unoccupied  and  may  be  sold.

isn't  it  a  pity?

•*•  ting  on  all  twelve  these  days.  A 
visitor  remarked  to  a  studio  official: 
"Pardon  me,  but  you're  a  supervisor, 
aren't  you?"  Whereupon  Ethel  com- 
mented, "Don't  they  smile  when 
they  call  them  that?" 

TANET  GAYNOR  has  gone  Garbo— even 
J  though  the  public  won't  let  her  play  roles  of 
sophistication. 

And  now — the  company  stops  at  five 
o'clock  sharp.  No. matter  what's  going  on, 
little  Miss  Gaynor  w-alks  away  on  the  dot. 

Okay,  Janet — you're  making  more  at  the 
box-office  than  Garbo. 

JANET  is  so  big,  dramatically  speaking, 
that  they  had  a  tough  time  getting  a  leading 
man  for  her  in  "Tess  of  the  Storm  Country." 
The  boy's  part  isn't  very  big.  Not  much 
chance  for  individual  honors. 

Lew  Ayres  was  first  choice.  He  demurred 
and  Universal  did  not  lend  him.  Alexander 
Kirkland  was  second.  He  also  demurred. 
He  was  under  contract  to  Fox  and  told  to 
take  his  twelve  week  lay-off  at  once  as  chas- 
tisement. Actors  arc  supposed  to  take  what 
they  are  given,  you  know. 

Then  Joel  McCrea.  But  he  didn't  like  the 
idea  of  being  second  fiddle,  either. 

Charlie  I'arrell  up  and  volunteered.  He'd 
like  to  play  with  Janet  in  anything.  He 
didn't  care  how  big  or  small  the  part  was. 
And  since  the  public  was  begging  for  Charlie 
and  Janet  to  play  together,  anyway —

"LJOLLYWOOD  doesn't  expect  Greta  Garbo

Manager  Harry  Edington  is  ill  in  the  hospital, 
but  we  understand  he  plans  to  leave  for 
Sweden  soon  after  he  recovers,  to  fetch  his 
famous  protege. 

They're  keeping  the  Garbo  dressing-room 
dusted  each  day  at  Metro,  ready  for  an  any- 
moment  surprise  appearance  of  this  always- 
surprising  woman.  And  her  name  appears 
each  month  on  Metro's  star  list. 

And  every  new  story  is  looked  over  as  a 
"Garbo  possibility." 


Just  a  kind  old  lady  who  trusts 
everybody.  Now  stand  by  for  a

Jessel  insists  he  has  the  screen  rights  to  the 
piece  and  Jolson  says  he  hasn't. 

The  feud  between  Jessel  and  Jolson,  if  it 
could  be  called  a  feud,  dates  from,  "The  Jazz 
Singer." 

That  was  Jessel's  outstanding  stage  hit, 
but  when  Warners  planned  to  make  it  into  a 
picture,  he  demanded  so  much  money  that 
Jolson  was  put  in  the  role  as  a  sort  of  second 
choice.

him  if  he  would  have  his  photograph 
taken  with  one  of  two  remaining

"Certainly!"    Jack  was  gracious. 

The  manager  dragged  the  weary

Arms"  were  supposed  to  be  over,  but  the 
picture  hadn't  been  previewed  yet  and  there 
might  be  changes  needed.  Well,  the  ladies

Kid  From  Spain"  set  when  the

And  the  overhead  was  mounting. 

Sam  Goldwyn  walked  down  to  the 
set  to  talk  it  over  with  Eddie  Cantor 
and  Director  Leo  McCarey. 

"It's  terrible,"  Sam  groaned.  "This 
thing  is  costing  too  much.  Some- 
thing will  have  to  be  done.  Pm  wor-

"You  do  look  a  bit  drawn,"  Eddie

in  mud.  Even  the  interior  shots  were  largely

Virginia's  hair  was  stringy.  Her  nails  were 
uncut. 

She  went  to  Director  Bill  Cowan  with  tears 
in  her  eyes. 

"Can't  I  have  a  shampoo  and  a  facial  and 
manicure  just  for  the  week-end?" 

"Absolutely  not.  You  might  not  get  the

And  Lyda  did  it  before  Garbo  ever  thought 
of  it,  we're  told. 

But  Billie  Dove  doesn't  go  solo  if  Phillips

"LJOLLYWOOD'S  best  story  of  the  month: 
Joan  Bennett  arrived  late  at  Winfield 
R.  Sheehan's  birthday  party  for  Janet  Gaynor. 
In  the  last-moment  rush,  Joan  had  forgotten 
her  glasses. 

Near-sighted,  you  know. 

Gene  Markey  led  her  by  the  hand  around 
the  buffet  supper  tables.  Joan  started  ahead 
with  her  plate.  She  ran  into  an  extra  chair, 
and  sat  down. 

The  roomful  of  already-eating  people- 
gasped.    Some  audibly. 

Joan  had  taken  a  seat  next  to  her  ex-fianec, 
John  Considine,  Jr.  Then  she  couldn't  very 
well  leave. 

And  if  Joan  had  planned  it,  she  couldn't 
very  well  have  devised  a  better  stunt  to  take 
the    limelight    from    Janet. 

All  eyes  were  focused  upon  Joan's  table

HOLLYWOOD'S 

New  Champion  Best  Dresser 

Mi 


Y  one  ambition  is  clothes!" 

Of  course,  you'd  anticipate  that  a  woman  made 
that  statement.  Libyan  Tashman,  Connie  Bennett, 
'Marlene  Dietrich. 

but  no!  Not  one  would  admit  it.  They'd  claim  that  such 
an  admission  would  make  them  look  frivolous  to  their  "  public." 
And  maybe  they'd  be  right. 

Remember  trie  furor  Constance  Bennett  caused  about  that 
story  printed  entitled  "I  Spend  8250,000  a  Year  On  Clothes"? 
She  branded  it  as  ridiculous,  as,  of  course,  it  was. 

"  My  one  ambition  is  clothes." 

No!    No  woman     at  least  no  woman  in  Hollywood — would 
have  ventured  such  a  frank  declaration.     It  took  one  of  our 
most  virile  and  popular  actors  to  be  so  daringly  frank.    George 
Raft  is  the  culprit,  and  he  confesses 
his  weakness  without  any  shame. 

You  saw  him  in  '"Scarface."  You 
know,  even  if  you  have  seen  him  but 
once,  his  dominant  masculinity.  You 
know  that  inflexible  power  which 
lurks  behind  his  suave  exterior.  You 
know  the  impression  he  instinctively 
inspires:  "I  could  draw  a  gun  as  cas- 
ually as  I  would  swallow  a  glass  of 
water." 

But  what  you  could  not  guess  was 
that  clothes,  mere  clothes,  have  been 
the  inspiration  of  his  life;  the  inspira- 
tion of  his  career. 

His  passion  for  clothes  makes  him 
buy  a  new  suit  every  week. 

He  never  wears  a  suit 
without  having  it  freshly 
pressed. 

His  shoes  are  shined 
each  time  he  removes 
them. 

His  ties  are  pressed  after 
each  tying. 

Every  suit,  every  shirt 
is  tailored  to  his  individual 
taste. 

He  never  leaves  his 
room  without  a  collar  and 
tie.  He  would  no  more 
rush  to  a  fire  (and  he  is 
mad  about  rushing  to 
fires!)  without  his  collar 
and  tie  than  he  would 
without  his  trousers. 

If  clothes,  in  this  in- 
stance, don't  make  the 
man,  they  surely  do  make 
the  man  happy! 


Eva  line 
Lie  be r 


George's  passion  for  clothes  carried  him  from  the  New  York 
Tenderloin  district,  to  the  boxing  ring,  to  the  cabaret  floor,  to 
the  vaudeville  stage,  and — to  pictures. 

Ambition,  some  one  outstanding  ambition — most  of  us 
have  it. 

The  desire  for  fame.  I  should  guess  that  this  was  the  mo- 
tivating power  behind  Norma  Shearer  and  Karen  Morley. 

The  longing  to  help  others.  Marion  Davies  was  originally 
forced  into  work  only  through  a  desire  to  be  able  to  buy  an 
automobile  for  her  mother  so  she  could  travel  as  did  other 
mothers. 

A  hunger  for  applause — craving  to  have  the  crowd  recognize 
you.  Lupe  Yelez  and,  undoubtedly,  Tallulah  Bankhead,  come 
under  this  heading. 

And  clothes  were  the  spark  that  kindled  the 
flame  of  success  for  George  Raft. 

Perhaps  he  inherited  this  from  his  mother. 
She  was  so  meticulously  neat.  An  Italian, 
George's  grandfather  objected  to  hisson's  union 
with  her.  '"I  will  throw  you  out  if — "  Not 
entirely  a  new  threat  from  an  indignant  and 
unreasonable  father. 

AND  George's  grandfather  meant  it — as  is 
the  habit  of  German  men  who  make  defi- 
nite statements.  He  was  something  of  a  person- 
ality himself — a  power  in  the  entertainment 
world.  He  initiated  a  new  method  of  fun  in  the 
same  district  in  which  Joseph  Schenck  was 
experimenting.  He  had  brought  the  first 
merry-go-round  to  America.  Should  his  son 
marry  an  unknown 
Italian  girl?     No! 

But  his  son  had  in- 
herited the  independ- 
ence of  the  father.  He 
married  the  dainty, 
joyful,  dancing,  singing 
Italian  beauty. 

The  grandfather  re- 
fused the  son  aid;  the 
son  had  no  trade.  The 
family  —  to  which 
George  was  soon  added 
— lived  as  best  they 
could  in  what  is  com- 
monly known  as  New 
York's  Tenderloin  dis- 
trict. 

The  word  brings  a 
definite  picture  before 
you.  Poverty.  Tough 
little  lads  fighting  not 
only  each  other  but  /(</■ 
each  other.  A  fierce 
battle  for  existence. 

Ill  ere  was  one  out- 
standing characteristic 
which  particularly  dif- 
ferentiated George 
from  his   Tenderloin

HE'S  back  rebellious  Jimmy,  who  for  a  few  mad  months  wanted 
to  play  a  doctor  role  for  life.  He's  come  up  smiling,  glad  he's 
starring  in  a  new  Warner  picture,  first  called  "Bad  Boy"  (the  obvious 
title  for  a  Gigney  film !)  but  probably  subject  to  the  usual  title  changes. 
Anyhow,  he  promises  to  be  a  good  boy  now,  except  in  picture  roles 


1 


"More  money,  or  I  won't  play,"  said  Jimmy.  But  Jimmy  cooled  down  while  the  producers 
warmed  up.  And  so  he  has  a  new  contract  and  everything  is  again  okay.  A  scene  from  his 
last  film  before  he  walked  out — "Winner  Take  All" — with  Virginia  Bruce  (Mrs.  John  Gilbert) 

Red-Headed   Rebel 


ANOTHER  Hollywood  Bolshevik  has  been  converted! 
James   Cagney  has  turned  from  a  militant,   red- 
headed, fiery-tongued  red  to  a  goose-stepping,  silent- 
tongued,  obedient  soldier. 

Not  long  ago  he  was  telling  anyone  within  hearing  distance 
what  he  thought  of  the  inequality  meted  out  by  producers.  He 
was  going  to  quit  movies  and  become  a  physician! 

Today,  he  says,  "I'm  satisfied.  I  think  it's  better  to  let  the 
whole  thing  rest.  It's  all  very  well  to  make  trouble  for  a  while, 
but  you  can't  go  on  making  trouble  indefinitely." 

You'd  have  to  know  Jimmy  Cagney — the  truculent,  irrecon- 
cilable, Irish  Jimmy — to  understand  how  funny  that  statement 
sounds  coming  from  lips  that  have  never  before  consented  to 
drop  any  subject. 

On  the  surface,  it  looks  like  another  victory  for  the  Holly- 
wood producers. 

After  a  session  lasting  from  nine  in 
the  evening  until  three  in  the  morn- 
ing— six  hours  without  interrup- 
tion— Cagney  and  his  cohorts  and 
Producer  Jack  Warner  and  his  ad- 
visers left  the  rooms  of  the  Motion 
Picture  Academy  with  their  arms 
around  each  others'  shoulders.  There 
was  much  back-slapping. 

There  still  is! 

Jimmy's  a  great  boy.  Just  ask  any 
one  at  Warners. 

And  Warners  are  the  original 
brotherly-love  organization.  Just 
ask  Jimmy. 


The  war  is  over,  the 
peace  treaty's  signed  and 
Jimmy  Cagney  is  once 
more  on  the  Warner  lot 

By    Cal    York 


And  this  after  six  months  of  one  of  the  bitterest  battles  ever 
fought  between  artist  and  producer. 

But  the  low-down?  Ah!  There's  an  interesting  and  yet  not 
really  uncommon  Hollywood  story. 

Jimmy  Cagney  allows  it  to  look  as  though  the  producers  were 
victors.  Yet,  in  reality,  Jimmy  won  that  for  which  he  was 
fighting.    Money. 

But  Jimmy  won  at  a  price.  He  was  getting  twelve  hundred 
and  fifty  dollars  a  week  when  he  left  Warners  with  this  ulti- 
matum:   Thirty-five  hundred  a  week  or  no  more  pictures. 

In  six  months,  his  contract  called  for  seventeen  hundred  and 
fifty  weekly.  The  six  months  elapsed,  with  Jimmy  on  strike. 
Now  he's  back  at  work  and  is  getting  seventeen  hundred  fifty 
weekly. 

But  he  was  out  of  work  for  six  months  without  pay.  So 
figure  that  out.  Which  looks  like  a 
Cagney  defeat.  But — there's  to  be  a 
bonus,  'tis  said.  The  difference  be- 
tween the  seventeen  hundred  and 
fifty  and  the  thirty-five  hundred, 
when  six  months  is  finished.    // — • 

And  here's  the  big  joker,  if  rumors 
are  true.  Jimmy  gets  that  bonus 
only  if  he's  a  good  little  boy  and  gives 
his  producers  and  directors  and 
various  other  bosses,  like  supervisors, 
no  cause  for  worry. 

He's  to  appreciate  the  fact  that 
silence  is  golden.  He's  not  to  talk  to 
reporters    who    delight    in    writing

Their 

Real  Roles 

were 

Tragedy 


Mabel  Normand  and  Roscoe  (Fatty)  Arbuckle  in  a  Mack  Sen- 
nett  comedy  of  some  twenty  years  ago.  Then  their  lives  were 
as  care-free  as  the  simple,  unsophisticated  roles  they  played 


A  BIG,  lumbering  fat  man  walked 
across  a  crude  movie  lot  to  a 
brown-eyed  curly-headed  little  imp 
and  reached  out  a  paw. 

"My  name's  Arbuckle,"  he  said,  "Roscoe 
Arbuckle." 

".Mine's  Normand,"  she  grinned,  "Mabel 
Normand.  And  the  little  fellow  over  there 
with  the  cock-eyed  feet,  is  Chaplin,"  she 
explained.  "Charlie  Chaplin.  Funny  little 
duck.     Comes  from  London." 

And  the  funny  little  duck  with  the  cock-eyed  feet  strolled  over 
and  joined  the  party. 

A  strange  trio  this.  A  huge,  lumbering  fat  man.  A  laughing, 
bedeviling  imp  of  a  girl.     And  a  slender,  quiet  little  comedian. 

A  strange  trio  indeed!  Little  dreaming  as  they  stood  there, 
that  twenty  years  later  the  world  would  look  backward  a  bit  and 
say,  "They  were  the  greatest  comedians  the  screen  ever  had." 

That  in  those  short,  hectic  twenty  years  of  bringing  laughs  to 
thousands  of  people  they  were  destined  to  pass  through  heartaches 
and  heartbreaks,  horrors  and  nightmares,  tragedies  and  even  death. 

They'd  have  laughed  if  you  had  even  hinted  such  a  thing. 

"Get  out,"  they'd  have  said,  "why,  we  have  no  ill  feelings  in 
our  hearts  for  anyone.     We're  out  to  make 
people  laugh.     To  forget  their  troubles.     To 
cheer  up  the  world.  " 

"Laugh,"  they  said,  "and  the  world  laughs 
with  you. " 

And  they  forgot  all  about  the  "Weep  and 
You  Weep  Alone. " 

The  screen's  funniest  trio.  But  little  dream- 
ing it  then. 

They  worked  like  dogs.  They  tore  and 
chased  and  ran,  madly  pursued  by  a  group 
of  maniacs  in  uniforms — the  unforgettable 
Keystone  Cops.  They  stopped,  these  three, 
custard  pies  by  the  droves,  smack  in  the 
countenance. 

They  began  work  earl) — at  the  first  crack  of 
clear  daylight.  And  toiled  until  the  Last 
glimmer  of  daylight  had  faded  into  the  Pacific. 
There  were  do  Klieg  lights  in  those  days. 

And  even  then  they  didn't  go  home.  They 
sat  around  and  planned  the  next  day's  work.

Those  dear,  dead  days  when  the  irresistible  Mabel  and  the  equally 
irresistible  Charlie  rocked  us  withlaughter  or  brought  tears  to  our  eyes 


On  Sundays,  back,  they'd  come.  Free  to  rest  or  play,  they'd 
all  find  themselves  back  at  the  old  studio. 

Mack  Sennett,  author,  director  and  actor.  Mabel,  con- 
stantly up  to  some  prank.  Chaplin,  never  satisfied  with  his 
make-up.  Going  from  one  to  another  until  he  finally  found 
himself,  quaintly  moustached,  wearing  a  pair  of  baggy  pants 
and  a  black  derby,  1907  model,  and  those  cock-eyed  shoes. 
Then  there  were  Fatty  Arbuckle,  Fred  Mace  and  that  star  of 
stars,  Ford  Sterling. 

Sterling  was  supposed  to  represent  the  finest  and  classiest 
bit  of  acting  ability  known  to  mankind. 

You  either  imitated  Sterling  or  you  weren't  an  actor.  That 
was  that. 

And  then  came  the  day  the  little  fellow  from  London  sat  him- 
self down  on  a  rock  on  a  nearby  hillside  and  sat  and  sat  and  sat. 
He  refused  to  run  another  inch  or  to  throw  or  receive  another 
pie.  Actors  stood  about  in  silent  consternation.  There  was  an 
air  of  hushed  expectancy. 

Here  was  something  new. 

The  cops  stood  about, 
saucer-eyed.  The  pies  left 
off  floating.  Mabel's  eyes 
sought  Fatty's  in  bewilder- 
ment. 

HERE,  if  you  please,  was 
the  screen's  first  bit  of 
temperament.  "It's  no  use," 
he  explained  to  Sennett, 
"I  can't  act  like  Sterling. " 

''Why?"  demanded  Mack. 
"What's  the  matter  with 
Sterling?  He's  a  swell  actor." 

"Sure."  Chaplin  agreed. 
"But  that's  not  the  way  I  feel 
things.  Look."  He  rose  to 
his  feet,  his  ridiculous  feet. 
"Let  me  do  it  this  way." 
He  lifted  his  derby,  his  eye- 
brows. He  twirled  his  cane, 
elegantly.  Only  to  have  it 
smack  him  unexpectedly  in 
the  rear.  He  tripped  off 
blithely,  only  to  stumble  over 
a  stone,  and  lift  his  hat 
apologetically.  On  he  went 
with  a  little  hop,  and  a  two- 
step  around  a  corner. 

"Well,  I'll  be  ,"  Sen- 
nett grinned. 

And  Charlie  Chaplin,  artist 
and  comedian,  came  into  be-  The  spunky  iittie  Nc-r- 

mg,  on  a  grassy  hillside  near  mand  portraying  Sis 

Hollywood.  Hopkins  back  in  1919 


Grand  days!  Grand  fun!  Then  came  the  picture,  "The 
Fatal  Taxi."  For  the  first  time  they  used  automobiles  in  a  pic- 
ture and  they  were  bitten  with  the  auto  bug. 

Sterling,  the  big  star,  had  one,  of  course.  But  none  of  the 
lesser  lights. 

FATTY  got  his  first.    It  was  a  Stevens  Duryea,  four  years  old 
at  the  time.  It  ran  swell  down  hill.   Ran  once  in  a  while  on  the 
level,  but  uphill  never. 

But  the  downhill  rides  were  enough  to  convince  Charlie.  He, 
after  considerable  shopping  around,  bought  a  Kissel  roadster, 
secondhand,  and  of  remarkably  doubtful  lineage. 

The  next  day  he  very  grandly  drove  to  the  studio.  Elegantly 
he  sat  behind  the  wheel.  Suddenly  he  realized  the  gate  posts 
were  too  close  for  comfort. 

He  became  excited,  dropped  the  wheel,  reached  out  with 
both  hands  and  tried  to  push  the  gate  posts  away. 

It  took  four  men  to  help 
Fatty  off  the  ground  that 
time.  This  was  too  side- 
splitting. 

About  this  time,  to  the  in- 
tense interest  of  Mabel  and 
Fatty,  Charlie  became  en- 
amored of  a  young  lady  of 
Long  Beach,  a  suburb  some 
thirty  miles  from  Los 
Angeles. 

One  night,  Charlie  and  the 
Kissel  started  for  Long 
Beach.  Halfway  there,  he 
descended  to  light  the  lamps. 
His  hand  touched  the 
radiator.  Naturally  it  was 
warm.  But  Charlie  was 
struck  dumb.  He  felt  again. 
Yes,  sir,  his  radiator  was 
warm!  He  ran  blindly  around 
in  circles.     His  radiator  was 


THEN  across  to  a  nearby 
store  he  tore,  and  called 
the  garage  in  Los  Angeles. 

"My  radiator's  warm,"  he 
shrieked.  "Yes,  it's  warm 
and  I'm  halfway  to  Long 
Beach.     Come  and  get  me." 

An  hour  or  so  later  a  menac- 
ing looking  mechanic  with  a 
monkey  wrench  in  hand 
arrived.  If  some  one  was 
trying  to  kid  him,  it  was  just

This  is  much  more  than  an  ordinary  studio 
scene,  and  when  you  see  this  production 
screened,  you  will  be  amazed  by  the  trans- 
formation.

and    the   Hungarian  star,   Zita   Johann,    with 


Boris  KarlolT  opening  the  door  and  Noble

from  Universal's  Berlin  office  to  Egypt  to  ob- 
tain the  authentic  atmospheric  shots. 

The  large  screen  on  the  left  hand  page  be- 
hind the  actors  and  the  movable  cab  interior 
is  of  frosted  glass.  On  it  we  see  the  Egyptian 
background  scenes  being  projected  from  the 


portable  projection  booth  in  the  rear.  The 
process  is  such  that  the  actors  in  the  studio 
actually  appear  as  an  integral  part  of  the 
Egyptian  setting. 

Karloff  achieves  one  of  the  greatest  feats  of 
screen  make-up  yet  known.     He  was  covered 


from  head  to  foot  in  dampened  cotton  and  col- 
lodion over  which  the  make-up  was  applied. 
When  it  was  completed,  he  was  unable  to 
-move  a  muscle  of  his  withered  face!  All  of 
this  preparation  for  only  three  minutes  on 
the  screen!

An  Irish  director,  a  Brooklyn 
matador,  bulls  and  beauty  and 
the  Cantor  himself.     Wow! 

By 

S  a  r  (i    II  a  m  i  1 1  o  n 


WE'RE  Spanish.  Carramba,  Sep- 
temba,  Octoba.  We're  Spanish! 
And  try  to  stop  us.  We  have 
bulls,  big  and  black,  that  mean  busi- 
ness. And  bull  fighters?  You  should  see  those 
side-burns.  Those  apple-green  pants  with  the 
Christmas  tree  trimmings,  and  those  pink  socks. 
That's  how  Spanish  we  are. 

Over  on  the  United  Artists  lot  in  Hollywood, 
Sam  Goldwyn  is  making  "  The  Kid  From  Spain" 
with  Eddie  Cantor  as  the  Kid,  and  even  the  bulls  are  llabber- 
gasted.     And  wait  till  Spain  sees  it! 

The  director  is  Irish,  the  cameraman  is  French,  his  assistant 
is  Japanese,  the  still  man  is  German,  one  villain  is  Dalmatian. 
the  other  is  I  rish,  the  comedienne  is  Polish  and  the  "  Kid  "  him- 
self is  Jewish.  The  bulls  came  from  Mexico  and  the  matador 
from  Brooklyn.    And  still  we  go  Spanish. 

They  began  with  girls.  Beautiful  senoritas — from  Iowa.  Out 
of  eighty-live  hundred  girls  they  chose  a  few  dozen  hot  tamales, 
sewed  them  up  in  open-work  lace  and  the  business  man  rush 
was  on.  Every  man  in  Hollywood  remembered,  very  suddenly, 
he  had  an  appointment  on  the  United  Artists  lot.  Good  old 
Sam  Goldwyn.     Must  see  Sammy. 

Wives  phoned  stenographers,  "'Where's  my  husband?  It's 
seven-thirty  and  the  steak  is  cold." 

"Sorry,  Mrs.  brown,  he  remembered  some  business  on  the 
United  Artists  lot." 

So  one  thousand  steaks  grew  cold  as  one  thousand  papas 
grew  warmer.     Such  a  climate. 

They  paraded  languidly,  these  beauties  in  their  sewed  on 
lace,  up  and  down  staircases,  holding  little  "Eddie  Cantor" 
dolls  before  them.  Their  glances  lingered  and  their  legs  twinkled. 
Two  gentlemen  were  carried  out  feet  first,  one  of  the  villains 
kept  his  eye  glued  on  his  baby's  picture.  Hob  Young  was  seized 
with  the  heaves  (his  youth  was  against  him)  and  Eddie  Cantor 
dictated  a  letter  to  his  ever-present  secretary,  "Will  take  five 
thousand  dollars  and  not  a  cent  less.  Yours  truly,  Eddie  Can- 
tor." 

In  barged  Goldwyn.  The  parade  was  still  on.  "Stop,"  he 
screamed.  "So.  I  get  the  most  beautiful  Spanish  girls  ever 
born  in  America  and  what?  You  cover  them  with  dolls.  Dolls. 
Hah.     Here,  throw  those  dolls  in  the  river.  " 

SO   the  parade  continued   without    the  dolls.       And   six  men 
were  removed  unconscious.     And  Eddie  Cantor  dictated  a 

letter,  "  Five  thousand  dollars.     Not  a  cent  less.     Very  truly 

yours.  Eddie  Cantor.  " 

Three  hours  later  the  prop  boy  rushed  in.     Exhausted.     A 

lather  of  perspiration.     "Mr.   Goldwyn,"   he  gasped,   "Mr. 

Goldwyn. " 

"What  is  it?"  he  answered.     "Quick.     Tell  me  at  once." 

"1  can't  do  what  you  asked.     1  tried  but  I  can't." 

"Can't  do  what?"  Goldwyn  shrieked.     "Don't  keep  me  in 

suspense, " 

"  1  couldn't  throw  the  dolls  in  the  river.      There  was  no  water 


in  it."     So  they  paid  him  thirty  dollars  a  week  to  stay  home. 
And  were  in  money. 

They  took  off  John  Miljan's  own  mustache.  And  that  made 
him  Spanish.  They  put  one  on  Hob  Young.  And  that  made 
him  Spanish.  They  dressed  Eddie  in  green  pants  and  pink 
socks. 

THEN*  came  Eddie's  big  scene.  The  two  Spanish  villains 
were  to  chase  Eddie  in  and  out  doors,  through  patios  and 
over  balconies.  The  cameras  were  set,  the  doors  were  marked 
and  the  chase  was  on.  Eddie  tore  and  leaped  and  ran.  Five  min- 
utes later,  he  bounded  through  a  door  and  two  carpenters  in 
the  room  each  swallowed  four  ten-penny  nails,  in  surprise. 
"Get  out  of  here,"  Eddie  screamed.  "You're  spoiling  my 
scene. " 

"What's  the  matter  with  you,  young  fella?"  they  said 

"Why.  I'm  making  a  movie."  Eddie  replied,  suddenly  look- 
ing around.     "Say,  where  am  I?" 

"Why,  you're  on  the  back  lot,  in  Mary  Pickford's  prop 
room,"  they  said.  And  ten  minutes  later  a  weary  and  sheepish 
Kid  found  his  way  back  to  his  set.  Where  a  surprised  company 
waited. 

"Where  in  heaven's  name  have  you  been?"  the  director 
asked. 

"Oh,  just  up  to  Pickfair  and  over  to  Malibu  for  a  swim,''  he 
groaned.     And  did  they  kid  Eddie? 

Ronald  Colman  and  Kay  Francis  were  making  "  I  Have  Been 
Faithful"  on  the  same  lot.  A  feud  grew  up  between  this  com- 
pany and  Eddie's.  For,  no  sooner  did  a  man  from  the  Colman 
company  put  his  nose  on  the  "  Kid  From  Spain"  set,  for  a  peek 


Eddie  was  gazing  bug- 
eyed  at  Kay  Francis. 
The  stage  door  opened 
and  there  entered  Mrs. 
Cantor  and  the  five  Can- 
tor girls.  "Papa,"  the 
girls  screamed.  "My 
heavens  look   at  papa"

at  those  girls,  than  the  electricians  and  cam- 
eramen were  at  him  with  a  rush.  And  off 
he  went.  Usually  on  his  ear.  Eddie  was 
vaguely  conscious  that  people  were  being 
thrown  out,  but  who  or  why,  he  hadn't  the  least  idea.  So, 
during  an  idle  moment,  he  decided  to  visit  the  other  set. 
Serenely  he  entered  the  stage  door  and  almost  as  one  they  were 
at  him.  The  director's  chair  was  upturned,  lights  were  over- 
turned, and  without  knowing  why  Eddie  ran  for  his  life. 

Out  of  the  corner  of  his  eye,  he  spied  a  bed  on  the  set  and 
made  one  leap  under  the  covers.  Instantly  there  was  a  scream. 
A  yell.  And  there  was  Eddie  gazing  bug-eyed  at  Kay  Francis. 
In  the  same  bed.  And  to  cap  the  climax,  like  the  third  act  of 
a  play,  the  stage  door  opened  and  there  was  Mrs.  Cantor  and 
the  five  Cantor  girls. 

"Papa,"  screamed  the  girls.     "My  heavens  look  at  papa. " 

And  papa  fell  back  in  a  swoon. 

ALL  the  time  the  "Idkay  from  Ainspay"  romped  over  the 
lot,  and  the  beautiful  Spanish  "  goils  "  pranced  up  and  down 
staircases,  they  were  constantly  aware  of  the  menace  that  did 
some  high-class  lurking  on  the  rear  lot.  Five  black  Muira  bulls. 
Glaring,  red-eyed  and  snorting.  Awaiting  the  bull-fighting 
scenes.  While  outside  their  pen  sat  a  huge  Mexican  on  guard, 
with  two  guns,  and  a  can  of  "Flit."  And  no  one  could  decide 
which  glared  the  fiercest.    The  Mexican  or  the  bulls. 

Visitors  were  escorted  quietly  and  in  awe  to  a  platform,  high 
above  the  pen,  where  they  looked  down  upon  this  mass  of 
horned  man-haters.  And  all  left  shaking  with  fear,  and  duly 
impressed. 


Then,  what  ho,  Sidney  Franklin,  the  famous  American  mata- 
dor from  Brooklyn,  was  summoned  to  Hollywood  to  add  some 
real  color  to  the  affair.  The  hero  of  many  a  bull-fight  in  Spain, 
he  arrived  at  ten-thirty  in  the  morning  and  by  two  in  the  after- 
noon, had  gone  actor  with  a  bang.  He  fussed  with  photog- 
raphers and  make-up  men.  He  worried  over  his  eyebrows 
and  his  hair.  He  had  no  objection  to  being  slightly  gored  in 
places,  but  he  was  going  to  look  hot-cha  while  it  was  going  on. 
And  who  could  stop  him?    Practically  nobody. 

THE  director,  Leo  McCarey,  had  thought  bull,  dreamed  bull 
and  planned  bull,  until  he  couldn't  sleep.  His  nerves  were 
wrecked  and  torn.  Everywhere  he  looked,  there  were  bulls, 
snorting,  raring,  goring.  It  was  awful.  He  arose  from  his  bed 
one  night  and  determined  to  walk  until  exhausted.  He  walked 
as  far  as  the  corner  and,  suddenly,  his  wife  heard  a  scream. 
She  ran  to  him.  And  there  he  was.  Throwing  stones  and 
shrieking  curses  at  a  "Bull  Durham"  sign  on  the  other  side  of 
the  street.  While  a  large  bull  glared  down  at  him.  He  ran  a 
fever  for  days. 

Then  Franklin  was  taken  to  see  his  future  playmates,  the 
bulls.  All  the  cast,  as  well  as  writers,  reporters  and  publicity 
men,  went  along  to  get  his  reaction. 

Franklin  walked  up  to  the  gate  keeper,  spoke  a  few  words  in 
Spanish  and,  without  a  moment's  hesitation,  entered  the  pen. 
Two  writers  fell  off  the  other  side  of  the  platform,  Lyda  Ro- 
berti  let  out  a  shriek,  Eddie  swallowed  his  huge  wad  of  gum 
and  could  only  gurgle  noises,  a  publicity  man  ran  for  Goldwyn, 
a  reporter  lost  his  balance  and  fell  toward  the  pen  when  lo,  a 
nail  caught  him  firmly  by  the  pants  and  there  he  hung,  directly 
over  the  bulls.  Someone  called  the  fire  department.  It  was 
awful.    A  panic,  nothing  short. 

While,  down  in  the  pen,  [  please  turn  to  page    98  ]

The  greatest  stars  of  college  football  are  here  shown  playing  together.    Every  man  is  outstandingly 
famous  and  you  will  see  them  in  Universal's  picture  of  thrills  and  spills,  "The  All-American" 


IT  was  the  dream  of  Knute  Rockne, 
the  peerless  coach  of  Notre  Dame. 
And  he  was  on  his  way  to  Hollywood 
to  f u  1  till  that  dream  when  his  plane  dropped,  in  that  fatal 
crash,  over  a  Kansas  farm  and  stopped  his  keen,  eager  mind 
forever.  That  was  last  year.  Nevertheless,  his  unfinished 
plans  have  been  put  into  execution,  and  the  most  remarkable 
football  picture  ever  filmed  is  ready  for  release.  "The  Ail- 
American,"  more  crammed  with  stars  than  a  Christmas  cake 
with  plums,  is  a  magnificent  gesture  to  our  second  greatest 
natural  sport — football. 

Imagine  a  scene  like  this:  The  grav  clad  players  turn  out 
of  their  huddle.  They 
come  up  to  the  line  of 
scrimmage.  A  blue  clad 
forward  wall,  two  hundred 
pounds  to  the  man,  faces 
them. 

A  short,  sharp  "Hike!" 
from  the  gray  quarter- 
back, and  they  shift.  Then 
the  starting  signal.  The 
ball  spins  back  from  be- 
tween the  solid  legs  of 
Nate  Barrager,  Southern 
California's  great  center. 
Tiny  "Albie"  Booth, 
Yale's  mighty  atom,  takes 
it,  turns  like  a  rabbit, 
hangs  for  a  second,  while 
his  interference  forms,  and 
he  is  off  for  right  end. 
Only  superhuman  block- 
ing can  help  him  now,  for 
Jerry  Dalrvmple,  end  for 
Tulane,  is  waiting.  But 
there  are  supermen  on  the 
job.  Jerry  is  smothered 
expertly  by  "Reb"  Rus- 
sell, the  celebrated  North- 
western back,  and  Jim 
Purvis,  of  Purdue. 

Past  the  line  of  scrim- 
mage disaster  looms  for 
little  "Albie"  in  the  em- 
bodiment of  Marchmont 
Schwartz,  Notre  Dame's 
triple-threat  back,  and 
Gaius  Shaver,  beloved  of 
Southern  California. 
It  is  the  moment  for  the

midget's  interference  to  function.  And 
they  function  as  only  Ernie  Nevers, 
"the  blond  switch-engine"  of  Stanford 
and  "Red"  Cagle,  of  the  Army,  can.  Schwartz  and  Shaver 
are  out  of  the  play  and  Booth  is  in  the  open.  But  only  for  a 
second. 

Out  of  nowhere  comes  the  tackle;  precise  and  powerful, 
lifting  Booth  off  the  ground  for  a  moment  before  he  is  slammed 
down  with  terrific  force  for  the  down  by  "Ernie"  Pinckert. 
It  is  the  brand  of  tackling  that  has  made  Southern  California's 
football  hosts  go  mad  with  excitement. 

But  now  there  is  no  tidal  wave  of  noise,  no  thunder  from 

the  stands,  no  cheering 
sections  convulsed  with 
hysterical  joy  and  admira- 
tion. 

Instead,  one  man  says 
quietly : 

"Not    so    good,    boys. 
Let's  do  it  again. " 

Not    a    nightmare,  but 
a  dream  come  true!

ambition  of  everv

selection  of  the  All  Amer- 
ican by  the  All  American 
Football  Board  has  be- 
come the  most  important 
newspaper  sports  story  of 
the  year. 

And  as  for  coaches,  they 
all  have  the  same  dream. 
And  their  dream  has  been 
to  see  an  All  American 
team  in  uniform  on  a  field, 
in  action. 

But  there  was  never  any 
prospect  of  fulfillment  un- 
til two  seasons  ago  Carl 
Laemmle,  Jr..  wanted  to 
make  a  picture,  call  it 
"All-American"  and  use 
the  complete  All  American 
eleven  in  the  leading  roles.

wildest  dreams  be-

All-American'

younger  brother,  Johnny  Darrow,  some 
pointers  on  football.  June  Clyde,  as  the 
love  element,  adds  piquancy  to  the  picture 


With  Knute  Rockne's  death  the  project  was 
postponed. 

Instead,  young  Laemmle  made  "The  Spirit 
of  Notre  Dame"  as  a  memorial  to  Notre 
Dame's  great  coach. 

THIS  past  summer  the  dream  came  true. 
Six  months'  preparation  was  necessary, 
for  the  players  had  to  be  assembled  from 
the  four  points  of  the  compass. 

Only  one  1931  All  American  did  not  appear. 
He  is  Pug  Rentner  of  Northwestern,  who  did 
not  want  to  jeopardize  his  chances  of  playing 
with  Northwestern  this  season  by  any  fin- 
ancial complications  that  might  becloud  his 
amateur  standing. 

Just  how  these  prima  donnas  of  the  grid- 
iron would  behave  was  quite  a  problem. 

Would  college  jealousies  and  playing  rivalry 
carry  over  into  the  picture?  That  is  what 
everyone  wondered. 

And  what  would  happen  when  rival  All 
American  ends  and  tackles  tried  to  prove  no

mistake  had  been  made  in  picking  them?  Football  players, 
good  ones,  have  just  about  as  much  temperament  as  any 
other  champions. 

How  would  it  manifest  itself? 

The  advance  psychological  dope 
turned  out  all  wrong. 

On  the  field  these  two  great 
teams  went  about  their  work  like 
wide-eyed  high  school  kids,  mar- 
velling at  each  other's  prowess. 

During  the  making  of  the  pic- 
ture a  warm  friendship  sprang  up 
between  "Albie"  Booth  and  "Red" 
Cagle.  Similarly  built,  small,  rab- 
bit-like, greased  lightning  in  the 
open  field,  they  had  seen  each 
other  just  once  before.  That  was 
on  a  chilly  November  day,  in  the 
Yale  bowl,  three  years  ago,  when 
Cagle  was  playing  his  last  year 
for  the  Army,  and  Booth  was 
playing  his  first  year  for  Yale. 


TT  was  in  this  game  that  the 
great  Cagle  was  bottled  up  al- 
most completely.  Thousands  who 
had  come  out  to  see  him  blast 
Yale  into  oblivion  with  his  light- 
ning-like thrusts,  saw  him 
stopped  cold  almost  every  time  he 
carried  the  ball. 

But  it  was  a  great  day  for 
Booth.  Unknown,  unwatched  he 
slipped  away  for  long  gains  time 
after  time.  A  bitter  pill  for  Cagle. 
To  make  it  worse,  Fred  Linehan, 
the  big  Yale  guard,  was  on  top  of 
Cagle  in  practically  every  play. 
Every  time  he  smashed  the  "Red- 
Head"  down,  he'd  crow: 

"So  you're  the  great  Cagle.

'  I  VHE  dream  of  every  young  man's  heart — to  have  such  a  girl  as 
■**  this  waiting  for  him!  Bette  Davis — who  registers  twenty-four 
years  hut  who  looks  like  fifteen,  off-serecn — caught  George  Arliss' 
attention  by  her  simplicity  and  won  that  splendid  role  in  "The  Man 
Who  Played  God."      Since  then  she  has  appeared  in  six  pictures. 


Bette  Davis's  hus- 
band —  Harmon  O. 
Nelson,  Jr.  —  is  a 
non-professional, 
and  Bette  says  she 
prefers  to  have  it  that 
way.  Here  she  is  in 
a  scene  with  Richard 
Barthelmess  in  "The 
Cabin  in  the  Cotton" 


She  was  Afraid  to  WED 


ANOTHER  Broadway  stage  actress  was  coming  to 
Hollywood.  The  publicity  department  sent  its  repre- 
sentatives to  the  station  to  meet  and  photograph  her 
— as  is  the  custom  of  studios  welcoming  newcomers. 

The  representatives  looked  at  each  woman  who  stepped  from 
the  train.  They  saw  no  one  who  looked  "actress."  They 
returned  to  the  studio — no  photographs. 

The  telephone  rang.     A  meek  voice  said,  "I'm  here." 

"Did  you  come  on  that  train?" 

"  Certainly." 

"Well,  you  can't  look  like  an  actress.    We  couldn't  spot  you." 

We  tell  that  story  at  the  beginning  because  it  illustrates 
better  than  could  any  long-worded  description — Bette  Davis. 

She  doesn't  look,  act  or  talk  like  Hollywood's  well-defined 
meaning  of  actress. 

When  the  company's  officials  finally  saw  her,  they  shook  their 
heads.  Their  New  York  men  must  have  been  mistaken  in  their 
choice.  This  was  the  day  of  glamour.  Bette  was  school-girlish. 
Her  autobiography  read  twenty-three.  (She  is  now  twenty- 
four.)  She  looked  fifteen!  Her  hair  tumbled  over  her  head  in 
uncontrolled,  natural  waves.  There  was  nothing  sleek  or 
sophisticated  about  her.  She  wore  adolescent-looking  dresses. 
There  wasn't  a  fur  coat  or  neckpiece  in  her  entire  wardrobe. 

The}'  cast  her  as  a  meek,  country  girl  in  "  Bad  Sister."  They 
typed  her  exactly  as  they  cast  her.  Such  parts  were  scarce. 
What  producers  wanted  were  more  Crawfords,  Shearers  and 
Bennetts.     When  option  time  came,  they  let  her  go. 

A  story  reached  the  press  that  she  was  rushing  East  to  see 
Harmon  O.  Nelson,  Jr.,  the  Eastern  boy  whom  she  loved.  It 
said  she  was  happy  to  leave;  she  was  anxious  to  get  away  from 
pictures;  her  heart  had  never  been  in  Hollywood  or  a  career 
but  back  in  the  East  with  the  sweetheart  of  her  school  days. 

Bette  says  this  was  untrue.  She  was 
in  love  with  this  lad  whom  she  has  since 
married,  but  she  had  left  the  East  and  the 


By  E valine  Lieber 


boy  determined  not  to  let  love  interfere  with  a  life-long 
ambition  to  become  famous  as  an  actress.  In  fact,  Bette 
packed  those  trunks  with  tears  which  dampened  the  clothes. 

If  she  really  wanted  to  get  away,  why  did  she  hold  those 
packed  trunks  while  she  rushed  over  to  First  National  to 
make  a  test  with  George  Arliss  in  "The  Man  Who  Played 
God"?  It  was  because  she  hoped  this  test  might  mean  the 
opportunity  which  ambition  always  visions  as  peeping  around 
that  mythical  corner. 

It  was.  George  Arliss  was  not  seeking  glamour.  He  was 
looking  for  a  girl  like  those  of  Merry  Old  England.  Someone 
natural;  unspoiled — a  good  fellow.  The  wardrobe  and  make- 
up departments  could  take  care  of  the  glamour. 

They  did.  They  combed  her  hair  down  (at  Arliss'  sug- 
gestion) and  photographed  her  from  a  profile  angle.  When  the 
officials  at  First  National  saw  the  rushes,  they  blinked  their 
eyes.  This  "child"  whom  Arliss  had  chosen  looked  like  the 
svelte,  smart,  sophisticated  Constance  Bennett! 

THESE  same  officials  had  paid  Connie  thirty  thousand  dol- 
lars a  week  for  two  pictures.    They  could  get  this  girl,  who 
looked  like  Connie's  younger  sister,  for  a  few  hundred. 

They  didn't  worry  about  glamour.  They  knew,  like  George 
Arliss,  that  it  could  be  developed.     They  signed  her. 

Bette  regretted  the  comparison  to  Connie.  Like  all  of  us, 
she  would  have  preferred  the  opportunity  for  success  upon 
individuality  rather  than  comparison.  But  if  looking  like 
someone  else  could  give  her  a  start — she'd  take  care  of  that 
individuality  business  later. 

No  girl  ever  unpacked  trunks  with  more  jubilant  joy! 

And   she,   too,   is  leaving  that  glamour  business  to  screen 

experts.     When  she  is  not  made  up  for  a  part,  her  hair  still 

tumbles  over  itself;  her  cheeks  are  still 

innocent  of  rouge;  her  lips  a  natural  pink. 

She   Still  [  PLEASE  TURN  TO  PAGE  110  ]

NIGHT  AFTER  NIGHT— Paramount 


HERE'S  your  new  hero,  girls.  George  Raft,  himself. 
In  what  a  picture!  From  start  to  finish  it  scampers 
along  at  a  smart,  snappy  pace  that  gains  speed,  interest  and 
pep  as  it  travels. 

George  Raft  (ah  there,  Georgiel  is  a  third-rate  pug  who 
becomes  owner  of  a  smart  New  York  'speak,"  goes  after 
culture  and  a  Park  Avenue  lady.    And  gets  her. 

Raft  is  a  sure  winner  in  this  one,  and  Constance  Cum- 
mings  is  simply  elegant  as  the  girl.  Wynne  Gibson's  take-off 
of  a  "hard-berled"  baby  is  grand,  and  Alison  Skipworth,  as 
George's  teacher,  is  perfect.  And  how  teacher  does  mis- 
behave! 

But  wait  till  you  see  Mae  West.  An  out-and-out  riot, 
Mae  is.     It's  snappy,  and  you'll  love  it.

stars  who  go  movie  in  a  big  way. 

Stuart  Erwin,  as  an  oil  man  from  Texas,  and  Bing  Crosby, 
as  himself,  are  two  despondent  Romeos  who  decide  to  end 
it  all,  only  to  be  rescued  by  a  girl,  Leila  Hyams.  Stu  buys  a 
defunct  broadcasting  station  and  arranges  the  big  broadcast 
with  the  Boswell  Sisters,  Kate  (the  moon  comes  over  the 
mountain)  Smith,  the  Vincent  Lopez  band,  Donald  Novis, 
Arthur  Tracy,  the  Mills  Brothers,  Cab  Calloway  with  his 
"Minnie,  the  Moodier."  and  finally  Bing. 

Sharon  Lynne  is  grand  as  the  fickle  dancer,  and  if  you 
don't  grow  hysterical  at  Burns  and  Allen,  you're  hopeless. 
The  story's  pretty  weak,  but  the  music's  grand.  Are  you

THE  ALL-AMERICAN— Universal 


IT  doesn't  make  any  difference  whether  or  not  you're  a 
football  fan.  Even  though  you  don't  understand  the  fine 
points  of  the  game,  you'll  sit  on  the  edge  of  your  seat  when 
the  All  Star  and  All  American  teams  meet  in  the  last  reel. 

Thirty-five  nationally  famous  football  heroes  act  in  this — 
among  them  Frank  Carideo  and  Marchy  Schwartz  of  Notre 
Dame,  "Albie"  Booth  of  Yale,  "  Red"  Cagle  of  the  Army,  and 
Johnny  Baker  and  Gaius  Shaver  of  the  University  of 
Southern  California.  There's  an  interesting  story  about  the 
filming  of  this  picture  on  another  page  of  this  issue. 

Dick  Arlen  walks  away  with  acting  honors,  but  Jimmy 
Gleason,  as  the  always  pessimistic  but  successful  coach,  is 
close  on  his  heels.  Andy  Devine  makes  riotous  comedy 
relief  while  June  Clyde  picks  up  the  feminine  honors  and 
tucks  them  into  her  new  puffed  sleeves,  in  spite  of  adequate 
competition  from  Merna  Kennedy  and  a  newcomer,  Gloria 
Stuart. 

When  a  boy  becomes  a  national  football  hero,  just  what 
new  fields  are  there  for  him  to  conquer  when  he  is  through 
with  college?  That's  the  underlying  theme  of  this  film  and 
it's  chuck-full  of  humor,  pathos  and  truth. 

Be  sure  to  take  the  children  as  well  as  the  missus  or  the 
girl  friend.

TROUBLE  IN  PARADISE— Paramount 


YOU  haven't  seen  the  real  Herbert  Marshall  until  this 
picture  hits  your  theater.  And  hits  is  what  we  mean, 
for  you'll  hear  the  impact  echoed  in  audience  applause. 
Besides  the  finished  performance  of  Mr.  Marshall,  this  film 
has  all  the  other  qualities  that  make  real  entertainment. 

Marshall  plays  a  super-crook  and  super-lover.  How 
women  will  envy  Miriam  Hopkins  and  Kay  Francis!  And 
the  clothes  those  girls  wear  prove  that  Paris  hasn't  cornered 
all  the  dashing  and  novel  style  ideas.  But  that's  incidental. 
What  we  want  to  say  is  that  they  turn  in  two  charming  and 
capable  performances,  Miss  Hopkins'  animated,  Miss 
Francis'  more  subtle,  each  in  keeping  with  her  role.  Aided 
by  Charles  Ruggles,  Edward  Horton  and  C.  Aubrey  Smith. 

The  theme  and  dialogue  are  sophisticated,  in  tune  with 
the  times,  but  Ernst  Lubitsch  directs  with  such  finesse  that 
it  doesn't  offend.  Neither  will  the  story  be  over  the  heads 
of  an  average  audience. 

It's  about  two  crooks  and  a  rich  Parisian  widow,  and  is 
one  of  Lubitsch's  best  productions,  so  we  don't  have  to  tell 
you  not  to  miss  it. 

And  don't  forget — here  is  your  first  opportunity  to  see 
the  Herbert  Marshall  who  captured  the  New  York  stage  in  a 
screen  play  that  gives  him  a  chance  to  be  his  fascinating  self.

RED  DUST—M-G-M 


rT~'HE  virile  Gable  is  back  again,  in  one  of  those  he-man 

JL  parts  that  made  him  famous.   With  him  is  Jean  Harlow, 

in  her  most  likable  role.    The  result  is  a  picture  worth  seeing. 

The  story  is  laid  on  a  rubber  plantation  in  the  jungle, 
with  Clark  the  owner,  and  Harlow  a  flip  little  "  Sadie 
Thompson"  type  with  a  heart  of  gold.  To  this  hole  of  red 
dust,  coolies  and  storms,  comes  Gene  Raymond  and  his 
bride,  Mary  Astor.  Gable  falls  in  love  with  Mary  and 
trouble  begins. 

There's  a  lightness  in  the  direction,  a  sparkle  in  the 
dialogue,  and  a  grand  punch  ending.  Jean  Harlow  gets  the 
most  out  of  every  line  and  all  but  steals  the  show. 

Donald  Crisp,  Tully  Marshall  and  Willie  Fung  con- 
tribute strong  bits.

SIX  HOURS  TO  LIVE— Fox 


THE  strange  story  of  a  man  brought  back  from  death. 
Warner  Baxter's  performance  as  Paul  Onslow  will  be 
remembered  a  long  time.  A  tried  and  true  representative  of 
his  government,  he  holds  out  against  all  members  at  a 
world  trade  meeting.  But  a  political  enemy  murders  him 
before  a  final  vote  is  taken.  A  famous  scientist,  however, 
has  invented  a  ray  to  revive  the  dead  for  six  hours.  And 
Pa  ul  is  given  six  hours  more  of  life. 

The  story  deals  with  those  tragically  short  hours,  and 
there  is  suspense  and  beauty  in  the  scenes  where  Onslow 
gives  up  the  girl  he  loves.  Miriam  Jordan  is  lovely;  George 
Marion,  Sr.,  excellent  as  the  scientist,  and  John  Boles  fine  as 
the  rejected  suitor.  Skillfully  directed  by  William  Dieterle, 
and  the  settings  and  photography  are  exquisite.

AIRMAIL— 
Universal 


POWERFUL  and  timely  story,  packed  with  suspense  and 
stark  cruelty,  that  points  an  accusing  finger  at  the  prison 
chain  gang  system.  Paul  Muni  gives  a  strong  performance  as 
the  returned  soldier,  anxious  to  get  away  from  routine,  who 
becomes  an  accomplice  in  a  crime  and  is  sentenced  to  ten  years 
on  a  chain  gang.  With  Director  Mervyn  LeRoy,  he  has  given 
us  a  fine,  vivid,  but  depressing  picture. 


THE  hardships  and  terrors,  courage  and  devotion  to  duty 
that  go  into  the  flying  of  Uncle  Sam's  extra-fare  mail  have 
been  thrillingly  captured  and  woven  into  a  virile  background 
for  romance.  Ralph  Bellamy  is  excellent  as  the  airport  super- 
intendent, and  Pat  O'Brien  equally  fine  as  the  daredevil 
stunter.  Gloria  Stuart,  Lilian  Bond,  Russell  Hopton,  Leslie

AT  last  Tallulah  Bankhead  delivers  a  performance  to  cheer

Montgomery,  a  rising,  young  advertising  man,  but  unwilling 
to  give  up  luxury.  And  then  comes  the  crash.  Tallulah  emerges 
penniless  and  Bob  jobless,  she  to  take  the  downy  path  and  he 
the  rough  one;  later  to  be  reunited.  You'll  forget  the  trite 
storv  in  the  sincerity  of  these  two. 


THE  story's  weak,  but  for  once  it  doesn't  matter.  This  pic-

keeps  you  rocking  in  your  seat  with  laughter.  Mitzi  Green 
tucks  a  fine  screen  performance  right  into  her  little  pocket.  Her 
mimicry  is  reason  enough  for  seeing  this.  Five-year-old  Buster 
Phelps  is  so  good  he  hangs  up  a  warning  to  Jackie  Cooper. 
May  Robson  is  magnificent  as  the  rich  old  grandma.

biggest  sports  factory,  and  it  gives  interesting  glimpses  of 
famous  champions  of  yesteryear.  Jack  Oakie  and  Warren 
I  [ymer  are  the  palookas  who  break  into  big  time  under  William 
Collier,  Sr.'s  management.  Marian  Nixon  is  cute  in  the  very 
slender  romance,  and  William  Boyd  is  the  villain.

WE  would  like  to  bet  you  didn't  guess  the  identity  of 
Jenny  Wren's  murderer  if  you  followed  this  as  a  radio 
mystery  drama.  Well,  here  is  that  mysterious  last  chapter  told 
as  the  climax  of  a  diverting  picture,  but  one  that  doesn't  get 
you  as  excited  as  its  chilling  screams  and  eerie  goings-on 
promised.  Excellent  cast,  headed  by  Karen  Morley  and 
Ricardo  Cortez. 


THE  Russian  revolution;  the  flight  of  a  dissolute  young 
nobleman  (Douglas  Fairbanks,  Jr.),  accompanied  by  his 
beautiful  serving-maid  (Nancy  Carroll) ;  their  subsequent  marri- 
age and  struggle  for  existence  in  a  strange  land.  This  story 
was  Doug's  own  selection,  but  it's  not  a  happy  one.  The  picture 
lacks  action.  Lilyan  Tashman,  as  an  old  sweetheart  who  per- 
suades the  young  aristocrat  to  turn  gigolo,  is  effective.

TIRED  of  penthouse  problem  dramas?  Then  see  this  story 
from  "Salomy  Jane,"  set  in  gorgeous  outdoor  scenery,  with 
none  of  the  thrills  left  out.  Joan  Bennett's  Salomy  Jane  may 
lack  some  of  the  fire  and  verve  of  the  mountain  tomboy,  but 
you'll  love  her  just  the  same.  Charles  Farrell,  Ralph  Bellamy, 
Eugene  Pallette,  Irving  Pichel,  Minna  Gombell  and  Sarah 
Padden,  all  fine  actors,  live  up  to  their  reputations. 


A  MAN  commits  murder  and  is  not  discovered;  later,  his 
wife  commits  suicide  and  he  is  wrongly  convicted  and 
hung  for  it;  hence,  payment  deferred.  Charles  Laugh  ton  made 
a  remarkable  personal  hit  in  the  same  role  in  the  stage  play, 
and  carries  off  the  same  personal  triumph  in  the  picture.  But 
the  story  is  hopelessly  morbid— all  right  for  adults  who  like 
heavy  problem  plays,  but  not  for  children.

A  STARTLING,  vivid  picture  with  a  brand-new  idea — an

AMUSING,  but  just  that  and  no  more,  this  one  trips  gaily

"WORRY/  Who-Me?  SAY/" 


OF  course,  I  didn't  believe 
Spencer  Tracy  when  he  first 
told  me,  "The  one  thing 
Hollywood  has  taught  me 
is  not  to  worry.  Seeing  everyone 
else  worry  so  much  has  opened  my 
eyes."  I  thought  he  was  just  talk- 
ing for  publicity. 

For  Hollywood  is  a  city  of  high- 
tensioned  nervous  systems.  "  Tem- 
perament" is  the  common  expres- 
sion. 

The  actors  continually  live  exag- 
gerated lives  because  they,  them- 
selves, are  exaggerated.  And,  pro- 
portionately, they  exaggerate 
worry. 

Greta  Garbo,  pacing  up  and 
down,  up  and  down  outside  her  set 
or  dressing-room  between  the  scenes 
of  each  picture. 

Marie  Dressier — talking,  talking, 
talking. 

This  worrying  has  become  a  Hol- 
lywood disease.  Flelen  Hayes  and 
Ruth  Chatterton  have  it.  Yes,  even 
Al  Jolson  and  Eddie  Cantor  can't 
escape  it. 

But  I  have  watched  Spencer  for 
a  year  since  he  made  that  state- 
ment. I  have  seen  him  make  "  Dis- 
orderly Conduct  "  "  Young  Amer- 
ica, "  "Society  Girl,"  "The  Painted 
Woman,"  and  "Twenty  Thousand 
Years  in  Sing  Sing, "  and  I  have  be- 
come convinced  that  Spencer  Tracy 
does  not  worry. 

"  I  had  to  learn  not  to  as  a  mat- 
ter of  self-protection.  I  had  wor- 
ried all  my  life.  But  there  is  so 
much  to  worry  about  in  Hollywood 
that  had  I  continued,  I  would  have 
gone  crazy. " 


YET,  Hollywood  has  given  Spen- 
cer more  reason  for  worrying 
than  it  has  the  average  Broadway 
actor. 

In  the  first  place,  he  arrived  a 
week  before  the  Hollywood  bank 
closed  its  doors. 

lie  transferred  his  savings,  every  penny  he  had,  from  the 
East  to  that  bank.     One  week  here  and  he  was  stranded. 

"  I  had  no  money  and  I  had  no  confidence.  I  used  to  stand 
before  a  mirror,  look  at  my  pan  and  say,  'It's  no  good,  boy. 
You  just  can't  do  it.    You  haven't  got  a  photographic  face.' 

"Whenever  rushes  were  shown,  I'd  hang  around  the  projec- 
tion room  door — crouch  back  against  the  wall  like  a  fugitive — 
waiting  for  executives  to  come  out.  I'd  follow  them  on  tip-toe 
to  listen.  I  wanted  to  know  the  worst — to  hear  what  they  had 
to  say  about  me." 

He  laughed.  "  They  said  'Quick  Millions'  was  the  most  mar- 
velous picture  ever  made.  All  of  Hollywood  said  it.  I  was  so 
excited  I  didn't  know  what  to  do.  Then  that  picture  went  out 
and  grossed  about  a  dollar  and  eighty  cents. 

"Well,  if  a  picture  which  Hollywood  said  was  good  couldn't 
make  money,  perhaps  a  picture  which  Hollywood  said  was 
bad,  could.  So  I  stopped  hanging  around  projection  room  doors 
and  began  thinking  about  this  worrying  business!" 

But  his  worrying  days  weren't  over  like  that — not  in  one 
moment  of  courageous  thinking.  He  was  cast  in  "She  Wanted 
A  Millionaire,"  opposite  Joan  Bennett.  At  that  time,  Joan 
was  engaged  to  John  Considine,  Jr.,  the  producerof  the  picture.

Spencer  Tracy  once  had 
"Hollywood  nerves,"  but 
he  learned  to  conquer  them 


By  Ruth   Biery 


The  gum-chewing  lad  thought  the  director 
was  "laying"  for  him.  And  did  he  fret? 
He  stayed  awake  nights  and  lost 
weight.     That  taught  Spencer  his  lesson 


It's  hard  to  tell  exactly  how  ru- 
mors commence  in  this  town  where 
they  live  upon  nervous  chatter.  In 
this  case,  probably  someone  said, 
jokingly,  "Have  you  heard  that 
Joan  Bennett  and  Spencer  Tracy 
are  that  way  about  one  another:'" 
and  in  two  days  the  entire  town 
had  heard  that  they  were  that  way. 

ANYWAY,  Mr.  Considine  heard 
it.  And  he  didn't  like  it. 
He  commenced  visiting  the  set. 
He  all  but  camped  upon  it!  At  this 
time,  Spencer  was  still  calling  Joan 
"  Miss  Bennett " — but  no  one  could 
convince  Johnny  Considine  that 
this  formality  was  not  for  his  ben- 
efit. 

The  coals  of  jealousy  sizzled. 
Whether  they  would  have  burst  into 
flame,  no  one  will  ever  know  for 
just  at  that  dangerous  moment, 
Joan  was  thrown  from  a  horse  and 
production  was  suspended.  Spen- 
cer commenced  to  call  at  the  hos- 
pital daily — as  did  half  of  Holly- 
wood. But  every  time  he  entered, 
he  met  Mr.  Considine  leaving — cr 
vice  versa. 

The  fires  sputtered  again.  Then 
—  Mr.  Considine  stopped  calling 
and  Mr.  Tracy  continued! 

And  just  at  this  point,  Spencer 
Tracy  was  cast  for  the  lead  in  "Dis- 
orderly Conduct" — John  Considine 
directing. 

Spencer  heard  Johnny  had  not 
wanted  him  for  the  role.     He  had 
desired  Clark  Gable  and  only  ac- 
cepted his  home-lot  pet  peeve  when 
Fox  could  not  secure  Gable.    And 
then  someone  tipped  Spencer  (was 
it,  perhaps,  Joan?)  to  the  fact  that 
Considine  was  "laying"  for  him. 
Friends  warned  Spencer: 
"If  there   are    any  fight   scenes 
in  that  picture,  watch  out.     He'll 
get  you,    Spencer.     He'll  get  you. 
It's  an   old  Hollywood  custom  to 
get  even  through  a  picture. " 
Spencer  studied  the  script.     There  was  no  fight,  but  there 
was  a  scene  where  Ralph  Bellamy  knocked  him  down.     That 
would  be  the  one.    Spencer  began  to  cultivate  Ralph. 

It  sounds  silly  to  us.  It  didn't  to  Spencer.  He  worried  until 
he  became  physically  ilL  He  lost  weight.  He  had  secured 
much  success  as  Killer  Meats  in  "The  Last  Mile"  and  other 
stage  plays — but  there  had  been  long  stretches  between  pro- 
ductions when  he  could  get  no  work.  Like  all  stage  actors,  he 
appreciated  the  size  and  steadiness  of  movie  incomes.  Also, 
like  most  stage  folk,  he  had  heard  the  weird  stories  of  vengeance, 
feuds,  etc.,  in  Hollywood.  This  would  probably  mean  ruin; 
bad  publicity;  perhaps  the  end  of  his  career  in  pictures. 
He  became  thinner  and  thinner. 

AND  the  day  that  the  production  finished,  Johnny  Considine 
walked  over  to  his  leading  man,  held  out  his  hand  and  said, 
"  Well,  I  certainly  did  you  dirt,  Spencer.  "  There  was  a  twinkle 
in  his  eye. 

Johnny  had  heard  those  same  rumors! 
All  of  Spencer's  worry  had  been  for  exactly  nothing. 
That   evening  he  did  more  constructive  thinking   than  at 
any  single  time  before  in  his  life.     [  please  turn  to  page  97  ]

Wears  Velvet 


CLOWERS  are  back  with  a  bang.  At  the 
'  right  is  a  band  of  them  which  may  be 
worn  across  the  front  of  the  frock,  as 
sketched,  or  down  the  back.  These  in 
blending  shades  of  velvet  and  chiffon  are 
arranged  with  three  massed  at  the  shoulder 
and  four  across  the  front.    Charming  note. 


EVERYWHERE  you  go  about  Hollywood 
l—  these  evenings,  you  see  velvet  in  one  guise 
or  another.  It  is  a  reigning  favorite.  The  vel- 
vet capelet,  shown  at  the  left  here,  was 
sketched  at  a  recent  opening.  It  is  made  en- 
tirely of  velvet  ruffles  graduated  in  size  from 
the  neckline.  The  interesting  part  of  the  cape 
is  the  way  it  is  worn  tied  in  the  back  with  a 
large  bow  of  the  material.  The  collar  consists 
of  a  small  ruffle  which  stands  up  closely  about 
the  throat.  Even  though  this  has  an  old-fash- 
ioned air,  it  was  worn  with  great  sophistica- 
tion over  a  velvet  gown  cut  deeply  in  the  back. 


T  should  be  a  real  thrill  to  know  that  you  may 
wear  an  exact  copy  of  this  stunning  evening 
gown  designed  by  Adrian  for  Tallulah  Bank- 
head's  new  picture  "Faithless. "  The  gown,  as 
designed  for  Tallulah,  had  a  long  slim  skirt  of 
black  velvet  ending  in  a  train.  Since  you 
wouldn't  want  to  go  swishing  about  in  a  train, 
it  has  been  adapted  with  an  even  hemline — 
just  right  for  dancing!  The  top  of  Chartreuse 
satin  is  much  the  same  with  perhaps  a  little  more 
discreet  decolletage  at  back!  That's  a  soft  vel- 
vet bow  placed  at  the  high  waistline  in  front. 
Tallulah  wears  a  short  chinchilla  fur  cape  with 
this  in  the  picture.  Note  that  she  wears  the 
favorite  evening  jewelry  of  Hollywood — two 
jeweled  bracelets  on  her  left  arm.  Tallulah 
as  great  chic  and  you  can  pick  up  many  smart 
hints  by  watching  both  details  and  costumes 
chosen  by   her   to   suit  various   screen    roles. 


COQUE  feathers  started  the  rage 
for  these  little  collarettes  worn 
with  evening  gowns.  This  one  is  vel- 
vet— the  petals  cut  like  curling  feath- 
ers.    Very  flattering  for  evening  use.

VELVET  hats  come  in  for  their  share  of  Holly- 
wood starring,  too.  This  smart  topper,  at 
right,  was  seen  recently  at  luncheon  worn  by  an 
attractive  blonde  star.  It  is  a  French  model  by 
Marcelle  Lely  in  brown  with  that  little  wing-like 
trimming  in  bright  green.  The  shape  is  unusually 
distinctive,  the  crown  is  given  a  square  draping 
with  the  brim  sloped  down  at  the  side  and  over 
the  eyes  in  front.  As  you  can  see,  the  brimline  of 
new  hats  is  less  definitely  slanted  and  much  more 
to  the  front.  Many  are  worn  far  over  the  eyes 
but  you  will  want   to  modify  this   line  slightly. 


TALLULAH  BANKHEAD  again— and  another 
I  triumph  of  Adrian's  art.  Tallulah  wears  this 
dress  for  a  traveling  sequence  in  "Faithless."  It 
is  a  perfect  dress  for  most  any  daytime  demand. 
The  dress  is  quite  simple  in  design  out  the  unique 
scarf  collar  lends  a  dashing  air  to  the  whole  thing. 
Made  of  green  crepe,  the  sleeves  are  full  and  tke 
neckline  beneath  the  scarf  collar  is  shaped  by  small 
tucks.  The  scarf  which  is  attached  to  the  left  side, 
begins  with  a  strip  about  six  inches  wide.  It  is 
widened  from  this  point  and  brought  across  the 
back,  falling  to  a  point  in  front  and  then  thrown 
over  the  shoulder  again  to  fall  below  the  skirt  hem 
in  back.  With  this  Tallulah  wears  a  vagabond 
felt  in  a  matching  shade  of  green.  Her  acces- 
sories are   black — brown  would  be  smart,  too.

HERE'S  one  of  the  cleverest  bags  of  the  sea- 
son. It  is  unbelievably  flat  with  a  con- 
cealed frame  and  an  unusual  monogram  set  in 
the  center.  Black  antelope  with  a  monogram 
in  silver  or  copper  which  is  one  of  the  smartest

UOLLYWOOD  loves  its  tur- 
'  'bans  this  year — and  doubly  so 
if  made  of  velvet.  This  turban, 
designed  in  Paris  by  Agnes,  uses 
a  crushed  velvet  draped  up  on 
one  side  and  held  by  a  cylindrical 
ornament.  A  strip  of  velvet  be- 
low   cleverly    shows  your    hair. 


A  SCREEN  fashion  is  designed  to  fit  perfectly  into  some  certain  scene  of  a 
picture  and  to  express  the  personality  the  star  portrays.  Travis  Banton 
designed  the  dress,  at  right  below,  for  Susan  Fleming's  role  of  smart,  sophisti- 
cated young  woman  in  "He  Learned  About  Women."  It  not  only  suits  Susan  s 
role  to  perfection  but  you  will  want  it  for  those  many  informal  dinner  parties 
this  winter.  It  has  been  adapted  for  you  in  a  pebbled  sheer  crepe  with  the 
same  puffed  sleeves  slashed  so  becomingly,  the  same  jeweled  clips  at  shoulders 
and  neckline — and  in  innumerable  colors.     Wear  it  with  or  without  a  belt. 


ZITA  JOHANN  wears  the  trim  black  woolen 
frock,  sketched  below,  in  her  new  picture  "The 
Mummy."  Vera  West  who  designed  it,  has  been 
most  ingenious  about  combining  two  fabrics,  wool 
and  satin.  The  wool  is  very  soft  and  sheer,  the  satin 
is  cleverly  used  for  the  girdle  in  front  and  for  a 
triangular  vest-like  arrangement  at  back.  The  triangle 
inverted,  is  repeated  in  front  and  stressed  by  unique 
silver  clips  mounting  to  the  shoulders.  Another  sil- 
ver clip  holds  the  satin  at  the  back  of  the  collar.

A  GRAY  silk  frock  trimmed  with 
gray  galyak — what  could  be 
smarter?  That  is  the  combination 
which  Travis  Banton  has  used  for  a 
street  costume  worn  by  Sari  Maritza 
in  "Evenings  for  Sale."  The  dress, 
sketched  at  right,  has  an  amusing  col- 
lar. In  front  it  just  covers  the  shoul- 
ders, in  back  it  dips  down  to  the  waist 
in  a  pointed  cape  edged  with  the  gal- 
yak.  The  high  bodice  buttons  down 
to  a  point  just  above  the  fabric  belt 
which  fastens  with  a  double  silver 
chain.  The  whole  silhouette  is  straight 
and  slender.  With  this  Sari  wears 
gray  accessories.  Her  hat  is  a  shallow 
brimmed  affair  of  fabric  with  an  orna- 
ment   formed    by    two    round    clips.

JUST  when  you  are  wishing  for  a  new  frock  that  is 
different,  along  comes  a  new  screen  fashion  that  is 
the  answer!  In  "He  Learned  About  Women,"  Susan 
Fleming  wears  a  silk  crepe  embroidered  all  over  in  a 
small  metal  figure.  Travis  Banton  created  it  for  Susan's 
dark  haired  type  in  a  lovely  red  flecked  with  gold.  A 
scarf  attached  to  the  neckline,  and  sleeves  with  fulness 
massed  above  the  elbows,  are  the  outstanding  details 
that  accent  the  simplicity  of  this  dress.  The  scarf  may 
be  worn  hanging  down  in  the  back,  as  in  the  picture 
here  at  left,  or  it  may  be  worn  covering  the  surplice 
neckline  in  front.  A  fox  trimmed  red  silk  coat  is  worn 
by  Susan  in  the  picture,  but  only  the  dress  has  been 
adapted  for  your  use.  That's  the  coat  on  her  arm. 
Susan's  choice  of  accessories  is  interesting.  Her 
hat  is  red  velvet  but  her  suede  gloves,  bag  and  shoes 
are  a  rich  cocoa  brown.  A  lighter  tone  of  beige  hose 
is  also  chosen — by  the  way,  hosiery  colors  are  tending 
toward  a  slightly  lighter  beige  tone.  Isn't  the  bow  on 
Susan's  turban  a  pert  affair?  You  may  select  your  dress 
in    several    different    colors  with    metal    embroidery.

tively on  the  bodice.  Ginger's

gay  checked  scarf — this  can 
be  interchanged  for  any  num- 
ber of  other  scarfs  thus  giving 
a  new  effect  each  time.  Rob-

from 
Pine  Bluff 


A  publicity  stunt 
began  her  stage 
career  and  another 
one  nearly  ended 
her  screen  chances 

By  Frances   Kish 


WHEN  sixteen-year-old  Winona 
Sammon  left  Pine  Bluff,  Arkansas, 
she  little  dreamed  that  a  few  years 
later  she  would  be  storming  a  big 
film  producer's  office  and  begging  him  not  to  compare  her  to 
Clara  Bow.  Winona  was  the  star  of  the  Pine  Bluff  basket-ball 
team,  but  Clara  had  already  begun  her  swift  ascent  of  the 
teetering  ladder  to  picture  stardom. 

Winona,  re-named  Peggy  Shannon,  and  Sylvia  Sidney  were 
the  two  girls  brought  to  Hollywood  from  the  New  York  stage 
by  Paramount  to  take  over  roles  originally  planned  for  Clara 
Bow.  That  was  when  Clara's  microphone  fright  brought  on 
a  nervous  breakdown  and  she  fled  to  Rex  Bell's  ranch. 

Peggy  replaced  Clara  in  "The  Secret  Call,"  and  found  her- 
self publicized  in  every  newspaper  and  picture  magazine  in 
the  country  as  "the  new  Clara  Bow,"  "the  successor  to  the 
'It'  girl,"  "Clara  Bow's  red-headed  rival,"  and  so  on. 

She  liked  Clara  and  admired  her  as  an  actress.  But  she 
knew  very  well  that,  except  for  the  red  hair,  they  were  as 
unlike  personally  and  in  their  work  as  any  two  people  could  be. 
She  knew,  too,  that  it  is  almost  fatal  to  a  new  actress  to  be 
compared  with  an  established  favorite. 

So  she  begged  the  producer  to  do  something  about  the  flood 
of  —  to  her  —  unwelcome 
publicity.  For  answer  he 
brought  out  a  sheaf  of 
clippings  from  newspapers 
and  magazines,  all  featur- 
ing the  name  and  likeness 
of  Peggy  Shannon,  but 
always  in  comparison  with 
the  naming  Clara. 

"Stop  this?"  he  argued. 
"Why,  girl,  that's  the  kind 
of  publicity  every  young 
actress  prays  for.  You're 
getting    your    name    and 


Peggy's  latest  picture  is 
"False  Faces,"  in  which 
Lowell  Sherman  plays 
an  unscrupulous  doctor 


Is  this  the  face  of  a  comedienne,  or  should  that  gorgeous 
red  hair  crown  a  queen  of  tragedy?  Peggy  Shannon  hasn't 
fully   decided   yet,   but   watch   this  girl  when  she  does! 


picture  in  every  column  of  movie  news  in  the  country.     Go 
home  and  say  a  prayer  of  thanks  for  such  a  break!" 

Peggy  went  home  and  said  her  prayers,  if  any,  for  the 
patience  and  the  ability  to  surmount  such  an  obstacle. 

"The  Secret  Call"  emerged  from  final  editing  as  a  not-out- 
of-the-ordinary  program  picture,  but  the  critics  had  nice  things 
to  write  about  Peggy.  Some  of  them  even  made  so  bold  as 
to  say  right  out  in  print  that  she  wasn't  a  bit  like  Clara,  but 
showed  great  promise  as  Peggy  Shannon. 

More  pictures  followed,  and  then  Peggy  found  herself  with 
five  months  of  her  contract  still  to  be  worked  out,  but  with 
no  roles  planned  for  her.  She  asked  Paramount  for  a  release, 
and  the  story  got  around,  due  probably  to  the  red  hair,  that 
she  was  temperamental  and  had  staged  some  stormy  scenes 
prior  to  leaving.  It  wasn't  so.  They 
shook  hands  all  round,  Peggy  wished 
Paramount  well,  Paramount  wished 
Peggy  well,  and  that  chapter  was 
closed. 

She  made  "Society  Girl"  for  Fox 
with  Jimmie  Dunn;  she  was  in 
Tiffany's  "Hotel  Continental";  she 
liked  her  role  in  "The  Painted 
Woman"  with  its  opportunity  for 
drama.  ''But  I'm  really  a 
comedienne,"  she  insists.  "That's 
the  sort  of  thing  I  always  did  on  the 
stage. " 

Much  as  Peggy  had  resented  the 
activities  of  the  Paramount  pub- 
licit}'  department,  she  has  reason  to 
like  publicity  men.  It  was  one  of 
their  species  that  gave  the  sixteen- 
year-old  [  please  TURN"  TO  PAGE  108]

Thin  Girls  need 

Sleep,  Food,  Exercise 


Here's  Sylvia,  that  little  dynamo  of  energy, 
who's  telling  you  thin  girls  how  to  have 
beautifully  rounded  figures,  compelling 
energy,  pep  and  magnetism.     Listen  to  her 


By  Sylvi 


a 


OYLVIA  is  known  all  over  the  world  as  the  beauty  expert 
of  Holly-wood.  For  the  past  five  years  she  has  been 
making  the  stars  lovely  and  has  received  as  high  as  $100 a 
treatment.  Now  this  masseuse  de  luxe  is  teaching  you 
how  to  do  for  yourselves  what  she  has  done  for  the  stars. 
Photoplay  is  the  only  magazine  for  -which  she  is  -writing. 
When  Sylvia  first  began  this  series  she  talked  briefly  to 
you  thin  girls.  Now  she's  telling  you  again  how  to  develop 
generally,  with  special  emphasis  on  your  big  -worries — 
■undeveloped  bust,  legs,  arms  and  shoulders. 

Work  -with  Sylvia  and  see  if  you  can't  all  start  1933 
with  a  figure  that  pleases  you!  Here's  the  -way,  if  you  -will 
really  -work   and  faithfully  follow  all  of  her  suggestions! 


IS  these  articles  I've  been  much  harder  on  the  fat  girls 
than  the  thin  ones,  for  the  reason  that  fat  folks  are  in- 
clined to  be  lazy  and  need  to  be  whipped  into  action. 
The  thin  girls  usually  have  surplus  energy  that  makes 
them  very  nervous,  and  for  this  reason  I  can't  be  too  rough 
with  them,  but  it  is  just  as  bad  to  be  too  thin  as  it  is  to  be  too 
fat.  And  the  fight  to  build  up  is  just  as  long  and  as  hard  as 
the  tight  to  reduce. 

Skinny  girls  usually  have  the  most  trouble  with  the  bust, 
the  legs  and  the  arms  and  shoulders.  Don't  complain  if  your 
hips  are  thin—  that's  great!  It  is  much  more  difficult  to  build 
up  in  spots  than  it  is  to  reduce,  therefore,  the  thin  girls  and 
women  must  build  up  generally  and  then — if  they  grow  too 
fat  in  certain  places  they  must  take  the  excess  weight  off 
with  massage. 

A  consistent  routine  is  vitally 
important  to  thin  girls— and  the 
most  important  part  of  that 
routine  is  sleep.  Get  ten  hours 
sleep  a  night  and  put  in  as  many 
hours  before  midnight  as  you 
possibly  can.  Three  nights  a 
week  make  it  an  infallible 
rule  to  get  to  bed  by  nine 
o'clock. 


IN  the  morning  take  a  luke- 
warm shower  (never  take  hot 
baths  at  any  time)  and  rub 
your  body  for  ten  minutes  with 
a  rough  towel.  Do  most  of  the 
rubbing  on  your  spine.  It  will 
start  the  blood  circulating 
through  your  body,  which  is 
what  you  need.  At  the  end  of 
this  article  I  am  going  to  give 
you  a  general  building-up  diet 
which  you  must  follow,  for  if 
you  do  what  I  tell  you  to  do, 
you  can  gain  fifteen  pounds  in 
one  month.  I  promise  you  that. 
Skinny  girls  can  do  a  lot  of 
things  that  fat  girls  shouldn't 
do.     You  skinny  girls  can  swim, 


To  develop  bust,  try  this  exercise,  described 
in  my  article,  before  an  open  window.  Re- 
peat it  slowly  fifteen  or  twenty  times  every 
morning,   and  be   sure  to   breathe  deeply 


vigorously,  and  you  can  do  plenty  of  tap  dancing,  for  you 
want  to  build  up  your  muscles  as  much  as  you  can.  But  you 
must  learn  to  take  life  easy.  Look  around  you  at  vour  fat 
friends  and  notice  how  many  hours  they  spend  sitting  and 
resting.  That's  what  makes  them  fat,  the  silly  things — that 
and  eating  their  heads  off.  Well,  take  a  lesson  from  them. 
Eat  and  rest  as  much  as  you  can. 

But  proper  exercises  are  necessary  too.  Exercise  is  necessary 
to  everybody,  since  it  puts  the  body  in  condition. 

Hundreds  and  hundreds  of  letters  tell  me  that  thin  girls 
worry  more  about  their  bust  than  any  other  part  of  their  bodies. 
In  the  first  place — don't  worry.  That  will  make  and  keep  you 
thin.  Instead  of  worrying  try  to  do  something  about  it.  But 
you  must  remember  that  the  bust  is  the  most  stubborn  part 

of  the  body.  You've  got  to  keep 
at  bust  exercises  with  all  the 
persistence  you  have. 

HERE'S  a  grand  exercise  for 
developing  the  bust.  Stand 
before  an  open  window.  Push 
shoulders  back.  Relax.  With 
arms  bent  at  the  elbows,  palms 
down,  raise  them  at  right  angles 
to  the  body.  Inhale  as  you  do 
this.  Turn  the  palms  inwards. 
Then  straighten  the  arms  out. 
Hold  jour  breath  for  eight 
counts  and,  exhaling,  slowly 
lower  the  arms  to  the  side.  Re- 
peat this  fifteen  or  twenty  times 
every  morning.  Do  it  slowly 
and  breathe  deeply 

Another  way  to  develop  the 
bust  is  to  sing.  Honestly.  I 
mean  it.  Look  at  the  grand 
opera  singers  you  have  seen. 
Every  one  of  them  is  full 
chested. 

Here's  another  excellent  way 
to  enlarge  your  chest  measure. 
Standing  before  an  open  window, 
use  your  arms  as  if  you  were 
swimming  with  the  breast 


ro 


Most  thin  people  are  nervous.  To  overcome 
it,  place  hands  on  either  side  of  the  back  of 
your  neck,  press  the  flesh  firmly  together, 
then  release.      Repeat  until  you  feel  relaxed 


Another  remedy  for  nerves!  Press  hard  with 
thumbs  at  the  hairline  about  an  inch  from  the 
ears.  Dig  in  deep  under  that  bone.  Do  this 
when  you're  tired.    It  thoroughly  relaxes  you 


stroke.  Do  this  hard,  feeling  every  muscle  pull,  as  if  you 
were  really  cutting  through  the  water.  It  will  not  only  de- 
velop your  bust  but  your  arms  and  shoulders  as  well,  and  it 
is  better  for  you  than  real  swimming  since  it  will  not  make 
your  hips  fat.  Do  this  every  day  for  fifteen  or  twenty  minutes. 
In  a  month  you  will  be  amazed  at  the  result.  But  be  sure  to 
do  it  earnestly  and  vigorously,  breathing  properly  the  whole 
time. 

WHEN  you  walk  hold  your  shoulders  up.    That's  vitally 
important,  for  most   thin  girls  are  inclined  to  slump. 
You  can  never  hope  to  develop  your  bust  if  you  slump! 

Another  very  stubborn  place  to  build  up  is  that  space  between 
the  legs  that  so  many  girls  complain  of.  But,  like  everything 
else,  it  can  be  done — and  don't  ever  get  discouraged.  You 
should  build  up  the  legs  all  over  first.  And  I'll  give  you  a 
grand  exercise  that  will  do  just  that.  Lie  on  youi  back  on  the 
floor.  Then  with  the  arms  still  along  the  floor  bring  yourself 
up  on  your  shoulders,  with  the  legs  pointing  upwards.  Spread 
the  legs  as  far  apart  as  possible  and  work  them  back  and  forth 
briskly  just  as  a  scissors  works.  Be 
sure  that  you  feel  the  muscles 
tighten  as  you  do  this.  Do  it 
fifteen  or  twenty  times  a  day. 

Here's  another.  In  the  same 
position,  with  the  legs  tight  to- 
gether bring  the  knees  down  to 
your  face,  then  shoot  them  straight 
up  again.  Repeat  fifteen  or  twenty 
times.  Also,  in  this  same  position 
use  your  legs  as  if  you  were  riding 
a  bicycle,  just  as  fast  as  you  can 
make  the  legs  go.  These  move- 
ments will  make  your  legs  larger. 

If,  even  after  this,  the  space  be- 
tween your  legs  is  still  there,  then 
do  a  little  camouflaging.  With 
your  hands,  knead  some  of  the  flesh 
off  of  the  outer  part  of  your  legs. 
This  will  make  the  space  look  less 
pronounced. 

The  swimming  stroke  I  have 
given  you  for  the  bust  will  also 
develop  your  arms  and  shoulders 
and  it  will  help  develop  your  back, 
but  in  order  to  get  rid  of  the 
"angel's  wings" — those  prominent 
shoulder  blades  that  thin  girls  have, 
you  must  build  yourself  up  all  over 
by  my  diet  and  plenty  of  sleep. 


Enlarge  Your  Chest 
Measurement  From 
Two  to  Four  Inches! 

HERE  is  a  breathing  exercise  that 
will  work  wonders  in  chest  de- 
velopment for  you  thin  girls.  Most 
of  you  know  the  regular  swimming 
breast-stroke.  If  not,  get  someone  to 
show  you.  Then  do  this  movement 
every  morning  before  an  open  window 
for  fifteen  minutes.  And  do  it  as  if 
you  were  really  cutting  through  water. 
It  will  develop  your  shoulders,  bust 
and  arms,  and  is  better  than  actual 
swimming  since  it  will  not  make  your 
hips  large  at  the  same  time.  But  be 
sure  to  feel  your  muscles  pull.  Measure 
your  chest  before  you  begin  and  again 
at  the  end  of  a  month.  Work  hard 
and  earnestly  and  you  will  be  amazed 
at  the  improvement  in  a  short  time. 


I'll  wager  that  there  is  not  a  skinny  girl  in  the  country  who 
doesn't  suffer  from  a  bad  case  of  nerves.  Now  that  simply 
must  stop.  Learn  to  take  things  more  easily  but,  more  im- 
portant than  that,  learn  to  think  about  something  besides 
yourself.  I  hate  to  say  this,  but  the  fact  remains  that  most 
nervous  people  are  selfish.  Whenever  you  feel  a  spell  of  the 
jitters  coming  on  start  to  think  about  something  entirely 
different  from  what  you  have  been  thinking  about.  Get  up 
and  walk  around  the  room.  Look  out  the  window  and  watch 
the  most  interesting  thing  that  you  can  see  on  the  street. 
Get  out  of  yourself. 

DON'T  you  notice  that  when  you  are  nervous  the  back  of  your 
neck  tightens  up?  Well,  when  you  feel  jumpy  here's  a  little 
exercise  that  you  can  do  at  home  or  at  your  office.  With  one 
hand  on  each  side  of  your  neck  at  the  back  press  the  flesh 
of  the  neck  together.  Then  release  it  and  repeat,  pressing  hard, 
until  you  feel  the  muscles  growing  relaxed. 

Then  with  the  thumbs,  press  hard  right  at  the  hairline  at 
the  back  of  your  head,  about  an  inch  from  the  ear.     Dig  in 

deep  under  that  bone.  This  will 
relieve  the  jitters  and  will  make 
you  feel  like  a  new  woman. 

Also,  with  your  hands  knead  the 
flesh  around  the  upper  part  of  your 
spine,  working  outwards  toward 
the  shoulders.  Don't  be  afraid  to 
dig  in  hard  and  do  it  as  often  as 
you  feel  you  should  during  the  day. 
In  order  to  get  that  drawn  tired 
look  from  your  face  you  must 
loosen  up  the  muscles  of  your  neck. 
There — you  thin  girls.  There's 
a  general  routine  for  you,  but  don't 
fail  to  abide  by  the  diet  which  fol- 
lows:

"That  Miss  Crawford  takes  herself  too 
seriously,"  some  said.  "It's  a  pose."  But  it 
wasn't.  Joan's  fame  did  not  protect  her  from 
scandal-mongers.  Her  eyes  reflected  her  hurt 


It  took  a  trip  to  London  and  Paris  to  bring 
back  Joan's  gaiety  and  laughter.  She  needed 
the  change.  In  the  carefree  capitals  of  the 
Old  World  she  recovered  her  sense  of  humor 


J 


oan 


lurns   to  Laughter 


THE  girl  with  the  "haunted  face."  The  girl  with  the 
"soul-torn  eyes"  they  called  her. 
And  then  Joan  Crawford  went  to  Paris. 
Away  from  the  eternal  grind  of  making  movies,  away 
from  Hollywood.  Gradually  that  tired  feeling,  that  tenseness 
of  a  panther  crouched  to  spring,  those  Hollywood  blues,  just 
naturally  rolled  themselves  under  an  insane  French  taxicab 
and — 

She  got  herself  a  new,  wide-shouldered  coat,  a  bottle  of 
French  perfume,  and  smiled  as  though  she  meant  it. 

Then  she  sailed  for  home.  All  across  the  broad  Atlantic  the 
smile  never  left  her.  It  stayed  with  her  through  the  customs 
house  in  New  York  and  across  those  three  thousand  miles 
home  to  Hollywood. 

She  got  off  the  train  absolutely  happy. 

They  whirled  their  car  around  to  the  side  of  the  house,  she 
and  Doug,  tore  open  the  side  door  and  almost  leaped  at  those 
waiting  servants.  Upstairs.  Down.  In.  Out.  Like  a  long- 
lost  puppy,  she  tore.     Home  at  last. 

She  even  reached  out  a  finger  and  touched  the  walls.  "  Gee, 
I'm  glad  to  be  home  again,"  she  kept  whispering. 

And  then  the  front  door  bell  rang.  It  was  Jerry,  from  the 
publicity  department  of  M-G-M  studios  and  a  good  friend  of 
Joan's. 

"Did  you  come  in  by  the  front  door?"  he  whispered  wildly. 

"No,  why?"  Joan  asked. 

"My  heavens,  Joan,"  he  said,  "it's  all  decorated  up  with 
vines  and  gardenias,  ycv.ir  favorite  flower,  and  in  the  middle  is 
a  wreath  from  the  servants  that  says  'Welcome  Home.'  ' 

Without  another  word  she  tore  into  Doug's  room,  clapped 
his  hat  on  his  amazed  head,  grabbed  up  an  unpacked  suitcase 
in  one  hand  and  pulling  Doug  by  the  hand,  raced  down  the  back 
stairs  out  to  the  front  and  rang  the  bell. 

The  butler  opened  the  door. 

"Oh,   hello,"  Joan  grinned.      By    this

time  Doug  had  spied  the  decorations,  knew  what  it  was  all 
about  and  came  to  the  rescue. 

All  the  servants  must  be  summoned  while  Joan  went  into 
detailed  raptures  over  the  front  door  decorations. 

Like  the  songwriter  who  claims  he  found  a  million  dollar  baby 
in  a  five  and  ten  cent  store,  Joan  Crawford  found  her  long  lost 
sense  of  humor  on  the  steps  of  a  London  barber  shop. 

A  friend  in  Hollywood  had  asked  her  to  please  bring  him  a 
certain  brand  of  toilet  water  from  a  certain  chemist  in  London. 
He  had  forgotten  its  name,  but  it  had  a  lemon  and  verbena 
base.     That  much  he  knew. 

Joan  sent  her  chauffeur  to  the  address  for  the  toilet  water. 
He  came  back  in  a  lather. 

"They  'aven't  it  ma'am,"  he  said.  "I  argued  and  argued 
but  they  just  'ave  no  lemon  and  verbena  base  toilet  water." 

The  next  day  she  sent  her  maid,  with  the  same  result. 

A  day  or  so  later  Doug  dropped  by  and  still  no  lemon  and 
verbena  toilet  water. 

THEN  one  day  Joan  was  in  the  neighborhood  and  thought 
she'd  try- 
"I'm  looking  for  a  toilet  water  with — "  she  began. 
"I  know,  lady,  with  a  lemon  and  verbena  base,"  the  clerk 
interrupted,  "but  I  just  'aven't  got  it  and  that's  final.    Maybe 
they  'ave  it  downstairs  in  the  barber  shop." 

So  Joan  went  down  the  stairs  to  the  barber  shop.  A  French 
barber  was  about  to  apply  a  hot  towel  to  a  stern  English 
countenance. 

"I'm  looking  for  a  toilet  water" — Joan  began  very  politely. 

And    immediately    the    barber   grew    hysterical.      "  With    a 

lemon  and  verbena  base,"  he  shouted.      "I  knew  it.     I  knew 

it.     For  days,  weeks,  what  do  I  hear?      Lemon  and  verbena. 

Lemon  and  verbena."       The   hot   towel

If  you'll  wait  at  the  door  of  the  Brown  Derby  restaurant, 
you'll  be  sure  to  see  every  famous  face  in  Hollywood 


So  you  think  you'll  just  run  over  to

famous  autographs,  do  you?  But 
look  at  the  folks  who  are  there

make  their  way  through  this  crowd

Ah,  There!  It's  Chic  Himself! 


The  only  Chic  you 
with  Noah  Beery 


No  dark  glasses  a  la  Garbo, 
nor  black  wigs  a  la  Harding 
for  him.  His  best  disguise 
off  the  screen  is  his  own  face 


IF  the  contents  of  Chic  Sale's  two 
enormous,  filled- to-overflowing 
trunks  could  talk,  they  would,  in- 
deed, relate  an  interesting  and 
amusing  story. 

For  Chic  doesn't  go  about  obtain- 
ing his  character  costumes  in  the  us- 
ual way.  No  property  man  "  ages  "  a 
suit  for  him  by  wiping  up  dusty  floors 
or  polishing  shoes  with  it. 

Chic's  characteristic  outfits  are  actually  "  aged  in  the  wood  " ; 
purchased,  invariably,  directly  off  the  back  of  a  character  he  is 
planning  to  depict. 

The  patches — if  any — are  legitimate  ones,  worn  by  honest 
toil;  mended  by  tired,  loving  fingers.  Garments  that  have 
served  their  masters  well  in  the  relentless  struggle  for  existence 
.   .  .   Life. 

There  is,  for  instance,  the  battered  hat  he  wears  in  his  Lem 
Pull  characterizations. 

Driving  through  Kansas,  Chic  stopped  to  ask  directions  of 
an  old  farmer  who  was  plowing  in  a  nearby  field. 

At  Chic's  approach,  the  old  fellow  left  his  team  and  came  to 
lean  sociably  on  the  dividing  fence,  while  he  gave  the  required 
information.  The  hat  he  was  wearing  appealed  to  Chic  as 
being  highly  atmospheric. 

"How  much  would  you  take  for  the  hat?"'  Chic  asked. 

"What  hat'-'''  the  old  fellow  was  obviously  puzzled. 

"The  one  you're  wearing." 


Yes  sir,  Chic  Sale — 
that  funny  old  fellow 
who  sports  whiskers 
and  chews  tohacco 

By 
Barbara    Barry 


Removing  the  desired  object  from  his  head,  the 
man  gazed  from  it  to  Chic,  suspiciously. 
"This'n?" 

"Sure."'     Chic  smiled  reassuringly. 
The  old  fellow  wiped  a  faded  blue  sleeve  across 
his  steaming  forehead. 

"Now  what  in  tarnation  would  anybody  be  a- 
wantin'  with  an  old  relic  like  this?    My  land,  1  been 
it,  winter  an'  summer,  for  nigh  onto  seven 
commented  the  puzzled  farmer. 

So  Chic  explained  who  he 
was  and  just  why  he  wanted 
that  particular  hat.  A  few 
moments  later,  the  bewil- 
dered farmer,  fingering  a 
crisp  new  bill  of  pleasing  de- 
nomination, watched  the  as- 
tonishing young  man  disap- 
pear down  the  winding  road 
in  a  cloud  of  Kansas  dust. 
"  Jumpin'  cornstalks! "  he 
probablv  murmured. 
"Won't  Sary  be  tickled! 
Now  we  kin  buy  that  pig 
we  bin  a-wantin'!" 


THE  conductor's  uniform 
Chic  wears  in  "When  A 
Feller  Needs  A  Friend," 
was  bought  from  a  baggage 
man  on  the  New  York  Cen- 
tral, at  Scarsdale,  N.  Y. 

"But,''  the  fellow  pro- 
tested, when  Chic  offered 
him  an  interesting  sum  for 
the  uniform,  ''I've  been 


would  recognize,  in  a  scene 
from  "Stranger  in  Town" 


wearin'  it  for  more  than  twenty  years!  It's  old — needs 
cleanin' — why,  shucks,  I  was  goin'  to  throw  it  away!'' 

"That's  just  why  I  want  it,"  Chic  explained.  "It's  seen 
actual  service.  It's  real!"  And,  leaving  a  sum  that  would 
easily  have  paid  for  a  brand-new  uniform,  with  a  red  lantern 
thrown  in,  Chic  triumphantly  carried  off  his  prize — a  bundle 
of  old  clothes  that  a  first  rate  rag  man  would  have  valued  at 
less  than  two  bits! 

Out  of  the  Los  Angeles  breadline  came  the  frayed  suit  he 
wears  in  the  poorhouse  episode  of  "When  A  Feller  Needs 
A  Friend." 

In  this  universal  collection  of  flotsam  and  jetsam,  one  old 
man,  hungry  and  weary,  unnoticed  and  unwanted,  stood  far 
down  the  line,  patiently  awaiting  his  turn  for  the  free  bread 
and  coffee,  so  generously  provided  by  a  well-known  local  organ- 
ization. 

Chic  approached  the  old  man  and  diplomatically  suggested 
that  they  step  aside  for  a  few  [  please  tirn  to  page  98  ] 


Up  the

Ith 


Jeanette 


She  sneaked  into 
the  chorus  back 
row.  That  was  the 
first  rung  to  fame 


"Can  you  dance — can  you  sing?"  they  asked  Jeanette  MacDonald. 
"Certainly,"   she   answered — and   then   proceeded  to  learn    how 


SHE  wanted  to  go  on  the  stage.  She 
could  dance  a  little,  sing  a  little  and 
act  a  little.  And  she  wanted  to  be  an 
actress.  So  does  everybody,  well, 
nearly  everybody,  else. 

But  Jeanette  MacDonald  wanted  to  be  a 
big  star.    A  famous,  beautiful  woman. 

And   so    does    everybody,    well,    nearly 
everybody,  else. 

Only  Jeanette  did.  With  plenty  of  odds  against  her,  she  did. 
After  ten  long,  hard  years,  Jeanette  became  a  famous  woman. 
On  a  moving  picture  screen. 

And  if  you're  anxious  to  profit  by  Jeanette's  experience,  to 
avoid  the  pitfalls,  and  can  take  some  good  solid  advice  from  a 
red-headed  woman  who  knows,  we'll  tell  you  about  the  rise 
from  a  scrawny  little  Philadelphia  High  School  kid  to  the 
recipient  of  Maurice  Chevalier's  screen  attentions.  And  isn't 
that  something! 

She  borrowed  her  older  sister's  fur  coat  and  started  out.  She 
looked  like  something  that  had  roamed  down  out  of  the  moun- 
tains in  search  of  food,  but  no  difference. 

She  thought  she  was  the  last  word  as  she  waddled  (the 
heavy  coat  kept  getting  under  her  feet)  into  Ned  Wayburn's 
office  and  asked  for  a  job.  She  kept  going  back  and  going 
back  until  Mr.  Wayburn  felt  there  must  be  some  talent 
beneath  the  fur  robe,  and  gave  her  a  job.  The  last  row  in 
the  chorus. 

So  the  family  moved  to  New  York  and  the  career  was  on.  Or 
off,  mostly. 

Near  the  close  of  the  show  (note,  please,  that  Jeanette  didn't 
wait  until  the  show  was  over)  she  decided  to  call  upon  Mr. 
Dillingham,  the  great  theatrical  producer. 

She  was  told  he  was  out  of  town.  It  didn't  phase  her.  She 
inquired  at  the  box-office  how  to  get  to  Mr.  Dillingham's  office 
and  the  boy  was  so  overcome  at  such  nerve,  he  told  her.  Only, 
he  called  after  her,  Mr.  Dillingham  was  out  of  town. 

She  climbed  the  steps  and  sat  in  the  reception  room.    He  may 
be  in  Algiers,  but  no  one  could  say,  in  her 
old  age,  that  she  hadn't  tried  to  see  Mr.         r>  r-» 

Dillingham.     The  office  boy  gave  her  a       By    ? TClIlCeS     UentOJl        only  to 


black  look,  but  still  she  sat.  After  all,  it  took  but  two  or  three 
weeks  to  get  back  from  Algiers  and  she  didn't  have  anything 
in  particular  to  do,  in  the  daytime,  anyway.  So,  she  decided, 
she'd  sit  right  there.    And  she  sat. 

Presently  the  office  boy  disappeared  and  Jeanette  tiptoed 
quietly  about.  She  found  a  door  and  turned  a  knob.  It 
opened.  A  handsome,  gray-haired  man  sat  behind  the  desk. 
It  was  Mr.  Dillingham,  no  place  but  right  there  in  New  York. 
He  sat  very  still  and  quiet.    And  appeared  worried. 

Jeanette  went  in.  So  sorry  to  be  rude,  she  told  him,  but  she'd 
been  waiting  such  a  long  time  and  after  all  she  had  something 
to  sell  and  he  wanted  to  buy  and  dear  me,  did  she  lay  it  on 
thick.  She  went  into  detail  about  how  good  she  was  and  what 
she  could  do  and  well,  really,  she  wasn't  the  least  bit  backward. 

AND  the  producer  smiled  and  seemed  amused  as  Jeanette 
went  on  to  say  she  merely  wanted  a  feature  part  with  the 
agreement  she  was  to  understudy  the  star.  And  that  was 
every  last  thing  she  wanted. 

"  Could  she  dance?  "  he  asked.  Now  mind,  could  she  dance. 
And  could  she  sing,  he  wanted  to  know.  And  Jeanette  nearly 
dropped  dead  at  the  suggestion  she  wasn't  the  world's  best. 

"Well,"  he  smiled,  "would  she  accept  a  place  in  the  chorus 
of  'Nightboat,'  playing  in  Rochester."  We-U  yes,  she  would. 
After  one-half  second's  deliberation,  yes,  she  would.  Only  that 
morning  he'd  had  a  wire  wanting  a  girl  to  fill  a  vacancy  and 
had  been  sitting  there,  worrying  over  whom  to  send. 

So  you  see.  Fools  rush  in  where  angels  wouldn't  be  caught. 
But  be  foolish  every  so  often.  It  pays. 
So  off  to  Rochester  dashed   our  heroine.

NOW  that  liquid  eyelash  darkener  is  pop- 
ular, a  lesson  in  its  application  by  Phyllis 
Fraser  is  very  timely.  Apply  to  upper  lashes 
with  upward  sweep,  to  lower  lashes  with 
downward  sweep.  If  stopper  brush  is  awk-

HOW  much  do  you  really 
job  in  the  movies? 
How  much  physical  pain  and  mental 
stress  are  you  willing  to  endure? 
Would  you  consent  to  having  an  operation  on 
your  ears  or  your  nose  (and  perhaps  pay  for  it 
out  of  your  own  pocket)?     To  have  perfectly 
sound  but  out-of-line  teeth  drawn,  perhaps  to 
wear  a  dental  brace  for  months?    To  have  your 
ankles  kneaded  and  baked  daily  to  reduce  their 
size?    To  go  on  a  strict  reducing  diet? 

Would  you  have  the  grit  to  face  silent  and 
sound  cameras  for  a  grueling  test  of  acting  abil- 
ity, photographic  value  and 
voice — the  sort  of  test  that 
Mary  Pickford  has  called 
"the  greatest  ordeal  of  a  pic- 
ture career"?  To  face  it, 
knowing  that  your  screen 
future  may  be  made  or  broken 
by  the  results  of  that  one 
day's  work  on  the  set,  before 
the  most  critical  audience  in 
the  world,  the  director  and  his 
technical  crew? 

THAT'S  the  kind  of  test 
Jimmie  Dunn  had  to  take, 
before  he  got  his  big  chance  in 
"Bad  Girl."  Jimmie  passed 
with  flying  colors  in  the 
opinion  of  the  director  who 
conducted  the  test  in  New 
York.  Fox  Films  took  a  thrce- 
weeks'  option  on  Jimmie's 
services  and  the  test  film  was 
sent  to  the  Coast,  to  be  passed 
upon  by  studio  executives. 

And  then,  just  when  suc- 
cess seemed  sure,  they  turned 
thumbs  down.  Nope,  the  boy 
wouldn't  do.  He  didn't  have 
what  it  takes.  Only  one  man 
in  the  executive  offices — Win- 
field   Sheehan — -was  satisfied

The  actual  "take."  Now  the  director,  too,  must 
stand  by,  silent  and  motionless,  while  camera 
and  microphone  do  their  work.  Here,  after  a 
week  of  intensive  study  and  preparation,  is  the 
deciding  test  of  talent  and  screen  personality 


He  insisted  that  Jimmie

contract  has  a  clause  that 
says  he  must  never,  for 
the  duration  of  that  agree- 
ment, allow  his  weight  to 
go  over  160  pounds.  There 
was  a  little  matter  of  a  sec- 
6nd  chin  that  showed  up 
in  Jimmie's  test,  and 
movie  executives  have  a 
feeling  that  one  chin  is 
quite  enough  for  an  actor 
who  plays  romantic  roles. 
Let's  look  into  the  de- 


i 


Way  of  finding  Screen  Stars 


By 

Fra n ces 
Kish 


tails  of  this  mysterious  process  called  a  "screen 
test." 

Even  actresses  of  marked  ability  and  long 
st^ge  experiences  are  sometimes  so  overcome 
by  camera  and  microphone  fright  at  their  first 
test  that  every  faculty  is  temporarily  para- 
lyzed. So  just  imagine  how  you  and  I  would 
be  affected! 

Well,  what's  so  frightening  about  it,  and 
what  qualities  does  it  take? 

FIRST  of  all,  according  to  the  test  director, 
it  takes  75  per  cent  personality.  "At  the 
outset,  a  girl  can  get  by  with  25  per  cent 
ability,"  he  says.  "Ability  can  be  developed. 
But  personality  is  God-given. " 

Waiting  in  his  ante-room  are  always  pretty  young  girls,  of 
course.  Pretty  young  girls  who  can't  seem  to  realize,  in  spite 
of  what  Photoplay  continually  tells  them,  that  mere  pretti- 
ness  and  youth  are  a  drug  on  the  Hollywood  market.  There 
are  personable  young  men;  character  actors;  "  types. "  Babies 
in  their  admiring  mothers'  arms;  chubby,  wide-eyed  youngsters 
who  speak  "pieces;"  frail  old  men  and  women.  All  of  them 
caught  by  the  glamour  of  motion  pictures,  the  stories  of  riches 
and  fame  that  await  the  successful  player.

recommendation  carries  weight;  some  have  been  spotted  in 
stage  performances  by  picture  "  scouts ; "  sometimes  the  director 
has  noted  an  obscure  player  in  a  vaudeville  act  and  his  expert 
eye  has  sensed  picture  possibilities. 

At  rare  times  an  applicant  comes  unrecommended,  unskilled 
and  untutored ;  totally  inexperienced.  In 
that  case  she  must  at  once  suggest  to  the 
trained  eye  that  she  will  photograph  in 
an  interesting  way  in  both  close-ups  and 
long-shots  and  that  her  voice  will  regis- 
ter pleasingly. 

THE  applicant  is  first  asked  to  do  a 
dramatic  scene,  a  recitation—  what- 
ever type  of  thing  for  which  she  has  a 
special  flare.  If  she  looks  like  picture 
material,  she  is  "  weighed  in. "  She  steps 
on  a  scale,  and  both  weight  and  height 
are  recorded  on  a  card,  along  with  color  of 
hair,  eyes  and  skin,  experience  and  other 
details.  Sometimes  she  is  told  at  once 
that  she  is  overweight,  that  she  must  re- 
duce a  certain  number  of  pounds  and 
come  back  again.  If  she  is  more  than 
five  feet,  six,  the  chances  are  she  will 
have  no  test.  Five  feet,  two  is  the  aver- 
age height,  and  girls  as  tall  even  as  five 
feet,  five  or  six  present  difficulties  in  cast- 
ing them  with  men  sufficiently  taller. 

If  a  girl's  face  is  too  round  and  fleshy, 
her  shoulders  too  broad,  her  bust  too 
large,  these  may  bar  her  from  pictures, 
even  though  she  is  slender  otherwise.

3  Exquisite  Pond's  Preparations 

The  Cold  Cream — for  cleansing  and 
softening.  The  Vanishing  Cream — 
protects,  and  holds  the  powder. 
The  Tissues — more  absorbent  than 
ordinary  tissues. 


"AT  boarding  school,"  says  Mrs.  du 
/y  Pont,  "when  I  first  realized  the  im- 
portance of  caring  for  my  skin,  I  turned  to 
Pond's  Two  Creams  ...  I  wanted  to  look 
'my  best'  for  my  first  parties! 

"Today  I  am  simply  devoted  to  those 
same  two  creams! 

"In  St.  Moritz,  I  never  went  out  with- 
out Pond's  Vanishing  Cream  on  my  face. 
The  air  is  so  frightfully  cold,  and  the  sun 
so  very  brilliant,  that  unless  you  have  a 
good  coating  of  protection,  your  face  goes 
absolutely  purple! 

"In  Bermuda,  I  found  Pond's  Vanish- 
ing Cream  absolutely  essential  as  a  pro- 
tection against  blistering. 


"Pond's  Creams  really  are  just  grand!

"Hoic  I  use  the  Cold  Cream:  A  Swell  Cleanser. 
I  never  found  a  cream  that  goes  into  niy  skin 
better,  and  gets  it  both  clean  and  refreshed  at 
the  same  time. 

"To  Rest  My  Skin.  When  I've  had  a  very 
trying  day,  a  good  cleansing  with  Pond's  Cold 
Cream,  then  a  fresh  creaming  and  a  short  nap 
with  it  on  takes  all  the  tiredness  from  my  face. 
"The  Things  I  use  the  Vanishing  Cream  for: 
Protects  from  Chapping  and  from  Sunburn. 
It's  great  for  that.  I  can't  say  too  much  about 
Pond's  Vanishing  Cream  as  a  protection. 
"It  heals  all  sorts  of  little  roughnesses  when- 
ever I  have  been  careless. 
"The  Best  Finish  to  a  Beauty  Treatment. 
It's  the  best  base  for  rouge  and  powder.  You 


know  you  are  going  to  look  fresh  and  groomed

The  feminine  figure  is 


OUERJH  FASHION 


The  modern  mode  has  recaptured  the 
elusive  charm  of  femininity.  Swim 
suits,  pajamas,  sports  togs  demand 
shapely  limbs.  Evening  gowns  dis- 
creetly reveal  gentle,  girlish  curves. 

The  fashionable  figure  is  the  figure 
of  health.  So  those  who  reduce  wisely 
win  health  and  smartness  together. 
Proper  exercise  and  a  carefully  planned 
menu  are  the  only  safe  way. 

So  many  neglect  adequate  "bulk"  in 
the  diet.  Then  faulty  elimination  de- 
velops. Complexions  may  become  sal- 
low. Eyes  may  lose  their  brightness. 
Wrinkles  and  pimples  are  other  fre- 
quent effects. 

Fortunately,  a  delicious  cereal  pro- 
vides this  needed  "bulk."  Laboratory 
tests  show  that  Kellogg's  All-Bran 
is  a  fine  source  of  "bulk" — similar  to 
that  found  in  leafy  vegetables. 

In  addition,  All-Bran  provides 
vitamin  B  to  help  tone  the  system,  and 


food-iron  to  help  guard  against  nutri- 
tional anemia. 

Two  tablespoonfuls  daily  will  over- 
come most  types  of  faulty  elimination. 
How  much  better  than  unpleasant 
pills  and  drugs! 

Enjoy  All-Bran  with  milk,  or  use 
in  cooked  dishes.  Appetizing  recipes 
on  the  red-and-green  package.  All- 
Bran  helps  satisfy  hunger  without 
being  fattening.  Recommended  by 
dietitians.  Sold  by  all  grocers.  Made 
by  Kellogg  in  Battle  Creek.

ANN  HARDING  believes  that  Christmas  should  be  a

a  number  of  guests  or  only  the  family,  she  plans  a  din-

gives  you  her  favorite  menu,  with  recipes,  so  that  you  can 
serve  her  delicacies  at  your  own  table. 

Clam  and  Tomato  Consomme — this  is  prepared  by  making 
the  clam  water  and  the  con- 
somme separately  and  then 
combining  the  two.  To  make 
the  clam  water,  wash  thor- 
oughly and  scrub  two  quarts  of 
clams.  Put  in  a  granite  stew 
pan  and  add  one-half  cup  cold 
water.  Cover  closely,  cook 
until  the  shells  open.  Remove 
clams  and  strain  the  liquor 
through  a  double  cheese  cloth. 
Add  two  cups  each  of.  the 
clam  water  and  canned  toma- 
toes to  one  quart  of  beef  and 
chicken  consomme.  When 
cleared,  add  the  soft  part  of 
the  clams.

stale  bread  in  one-third  inch  slices  and  shape  with  a  round 
cutter.  Spread  with  butter  and,  with  a  smaller  round  cut- 
ter, shape  into  rings  that  are  as  wide  as  they  are  thick.  Cut 
the  bread  in  one-third  inch  slices,  spread  with  butter,  and

Frozen  Apples — -Wipe,  pare,  core  and  cut  ten  apples  in  quar- 
ters. Put  into  a  stew  pan,  sprinkle  with  sugar  and  add  a  few 
grains  of  salt.  Cover  with  boiling  water  and  cook  until  apples 
are  soft.  Rub  through  a  sieve  and  add  two-thirds  cup  of  cider 
and  two  tablespoons  lemon  juice.  Freeze  to  a  mush  and 
serve  in  cups  made  from  bright  red  apples. 

Glazed  Silver  Skin  Onions — Peel  small  onions  and  cook  in  boil- 
ing salted  water  until  tender.  Drain  and  saute  in  butter,  to  which 
is  added  a  small  quantity  of  sugar,  until  delicately  browned. 

Pimento  Timbales — Line 
slightly  buttered  individual  tin 
moulds  with  canned  pimentos 
and  fill  with  chicken  forcemeat.

with  buttered  paper  and  bake 
until  firm.  Remove  from 
moulds,  insert  a  small  sprig  of 
parsley  in  each  and  serve  with 
mushroom  sauce. 

Here  is  the  chicken  forcemeat 
recipe:  Cook  two  tablespoons 
butter,  one-fourth  cup  stale 
bread  crumbs  and  two-thirds 
cup  milk  five  minutes.  To  this 
add  one  cup  cooked  chicken 
forced  through  a  sieve.  Add  two 
eggs  slightly  beaten.     Season.

LFTTFRS  came  in  so  fast  this  month  ask- 
ing for  information  about  "newcomers" 
I  hat  the  old  Answer  Man  just  had  to 
pick  the  four  about  whom  lie  received  the 
most  questions.  They  are  Dick  Powell,  Gloria 
Stuart,  Lyle  Talbot  and  Adrienne  Ames. 
II'  re  is  a  short  history  of  each: 

Dick  Powell,  the  lad  who  clicked  in  "Blessed 
Event,"  comes  from  a  little  town  called 
Mountain  View,  in  Arkansas.  For  the  past 
five  «r  six  years  he  has  been  acting  as  M.C. 
(Master  of  Ceremonies)  in  various  theaters. 
He  went  into  the  theatrical  business  because  he 
liked  to  sing.  He  has  wavy  brown  hair,  blue 
eyes  and  a  big  grin  that  just  thrills  the  girls 
who  see  him,  both  on  and  off  screen.  He  likes 
making  pictures  in  Hollywood  because  it  keeps 
him  in  one  place  and  he  can  have  his  mother 
and  dad  with  him.  He  was  married  once,  but  it 
didn't  last.  In  his  spare  time  he  plays  golf 
and  tennis.  His  best  friend  is  Joe  E.  Brown. 
Dick  got  a  nice  contract  with  Warners  after 
his  hit  in  "Blessed  Event." 

Gloria  Stuart,  Universal  player,  has  been 
in  pictures  since  last  February  and  has  been 
steadily  getting  ahead.  She  is  a  native  of 
Santa  Monica,  Calif.  Has  been  celebrating 
her  birthday  on  the  4th  of  July  ever  since  1910. 
She  is  5  feet,  5  inches  tall;  weighs  118  and  has 
blonde  hair  and  blue  eyes.  For  eight  years, 
prior  to  going  into  pictures,  she  appeared  in 
amateur  theatricals.  Has  been  married  to 
Blair  Gordon  Newell,  a  sculptor,  since  June, 
1930.  Her  latest  pictures  are  "Airmail"  and 
"The  All  American." 

Lyle  Talbot's  career  was  practically  settled 
before  he  was  born.  Both  his  parents  belonged 
to  the  stage.  His  father  owned  stock  com- 
panies throughout  the  Middle  West.  Lyle 
was  born  on  February  8,  1904,  in  Pittsburgh, 
Penna.  At  the  age  of  sixteen  he  started  his 
career  when  his  parents  took  him  on  the  stage 
with  them.  He  began  as  a  magician  but  gave 
it  up  shortly  afterward  to  return  to  school. 
At  nineteen  he  went  back  to  the  stage  in  "St. 
Elmo."  Lyle  is  5  feet,  11J4  inches  tall; 
weighs  172  pounds  and  has  brown  hair  and 
blue  eyes.  His  real  name  is  Lysle  Hollywood, 
but  because  he  knew  no  one  would  believe  it 
was  true  he  changed  it  to  Lyle  Talbot.  He 
got  a  screen  test  at  Warners  which  proved 
successful  and  was  given  a  role  in  "Love  Is  a 
Racket."  This  was  followed  by  "Big  City 
Blues,"  "The  Purchase  Price,"  "Three  on  a 
Match,"  "The  Thirteenth  Guest"  and  "Klon- 
dike." Lyle  likes  bicycling,  tennis,  golf  and 
handball.

Adrienne  Ames  had  a  movie  career  fall  into 
her  lap.  When  she  and  her  millionaire  hus- 
band, Stephen  Ames,  stopped  off  in  Hollywood 
on  their  way  back  from  a  vacation  in  Honolulu, 
Adrienne  wanted  Ruth  Harriet  Louise,  Holly- 
wood photographer,  to  take  some  pictures  of 
her.  Ruth  took  the  pictures  and  thought  they 
were  so  good  that  she  sent  them  to  Paramount. 
Paramount  sent  for  Adrienne  and  she  was 
given  a  part  in  "24  Hours."  Next  came  "Girls 
About  Town,"  "One  Hour  With  You"  and 
"Guilty  as  Hell."  Adrienne  is  a  native  of 
Fort  Worth,  Texas,  born  there  on  August  3, 
1909.  She  is  5  feet,  4lA  inches  tall;  weighs  116 
and  has  reddish  brown  hair  and  blue  eyes. 
Her  real  name  is  Adrienne  McClure. 

Betty  Horton,  Chicago,  III.  —  Wally 
Beery  was  born  on  April  1.  No  foolin'. 
Here's  the  low-down  on  your  favorites,  Don 
Cook  and  Bette  Davis.  Don  was  born  in 
Portland,  Ore.,  on  September  26,  1901.  He 
is  5  feet,  llj^  inches  tall;  weighs  147  pounds 
and  has  dark  hair  and  dark  eyes.  Was  on 
the  stage  in  "Rebound,"  "The  Rivals,"  "Spell- 
bound," "Paris,"  and  "Half  Gods."  His  next 
picture  will]  be  "The  Conquerors."  Bette  was 
born  on  April  5,  1908,  in  Lowell,  Mass.  She 
is  5  feet,  V/i  inches  tall;  weighs  110  pounds 
and  has  blonde  hair  and  blue  eyes.  She  entered 
pictures  in  1930.  Was  married  to  Harmon  O. 
Nelson,  Jr.  in  Yuma,  Ariz.,  on  August  18,  1932. 

Hatchet,  Herndon,  Va.  —  With  a  name 
like  that  I'd  expect  you  to  go  into  a  war  dance 
any  minute.  The  Warner  studios  say  that 
David  Mariners  did  all  his  own  singing  in 
"Crooner"  and  you'll  have  to  believe  them. 
They  made  the  picture  and  they  ought  to  know. 


Louise  Le  Chien,  Pittsburg,  Kan. — And 
I  thought  Pittsburgh  was  in  Pennsylvania. 
Guess  I  must  be  getting  old.  Lots  cf  folks 
think  that  Ken  Murray  nearly  stole  the  pic- 
ture "Crooner"  from  David  Manners.  Well, 
here's  the  low-down  on  Ken.  He  is  a  native 
of  little  old  New  York,  born  on  July  14,  1903. 
He  is  6  feet,  1  inch  tall;  weighs  179  pounds 
and  has  dark  brown  hair  and  light  brown  eyes. 
His  real  name  is  Kenneth  Doucourt.  He 
started  in  pictures  in  1929.  Appeared  in 
"Leathernecking,"  "Ladies  of  the  Jury,"  and 
"Girl  Crazy."  He  and  Mary  Brian  worked 
together  in  vaudeville  for  about  nine  months. 
Much  romance  was  rumored  about  them  dur- 
ing that  time,  but  so  far  they  have  remained 
single. 

Virginia  Morgan,  Fort  Worth,  Tex. — 
Settling  bets  is  my  pastime  and  hobby.  The 
young  fellow  who  appeared  opposite  Dolores 
Del  Rio  in  "The  Red  Dance"  was  Charlie 
Farrell.    Remember  now? 

Miriam  Brewer,  Montgomery,  Ala.  — 
Charles  Laughton,  note  the  correct  spelling, 
Miriam,  was  born  in  Scarborough,  England  on 
July  1,  1899.  He  is  5  feet,  10^  inches  tall; 
weighs  180  pounds  and  has  medium  brown 
hair  and  blue  eyes.  Is  married  to  Elsa  Lan- 
chester.  Charles  attended  the  Stonyhurst 
College  in  England  and  also  the  Royal 
Academy  of  Dramatic  Art.  He  appeared  on 
the  British  stage  for  six  years  and  on  the 
American  stage  for  another  six  years  before 
he  finally  went  into  pictures.  His  first  picture 
was  "Devil  and  the  Deep."  Then  came  "The 
Old  Dark  House."  If  you're  a  Laughton  fan 
now,  wait  until  you  see  Charles  as  Xcro  in 
"The  Sign  of  the  Cross."  His  hobby,  believe 
it  or  not,  is  gardening. 

Frank  Lukes,  Chicago,  III.  —  Frank, 
you're  not  going  to  see  Marguerite  Churchill 
on  the  screen  for  some  time.  She  returns  to 
Broadway  in  a  new  play  called  "Dinner  at 
Eight." 

Mary,  Brooklyn,  N.  Y. — Mary,  how  can 
you  ask  me  to  name  the  most  popular 
"crooner"  who  ever  made  a  picture?  Do  you 
want  me  to  get  my  old  grey  beard  pulled? 
With  Rudy  Vallee,  Bing  Crosby,  David  Man- 
ners and  Dick  Powell  all  crooning  their  best, 
do  you  think  I  would  risk  voicing  an  opinion? 
I'm  leaving  it  to  you  to  make  your  own 
decision.

Beauty    Chatter    From    Hollywood 


By 

Carolyn 

Van 

Wyck 


"THE  advantages  of  a  triple  mirror  for'your  dressing- 
'  table  are  emphasized  by  this  view  of  Una  Merkel. 

Good  looks  are  no  longer  confined    to   the   front. 

Every  little  back  and  side  detail  must  be  considered. 


Fyou  thinkyour  face  curls  and  lacquer  wigs 

of  modern    inspiration,  then  consider  this 

spectacular  coiffure  of  two  thousand  years 

ago  designed  for  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross." 


pEGGY  SHANNON  looked  very  gay  and 
*-  happy  as  she  showed  me  a  smart,  brown  bag 
with  metal  frame  of  Chanel  inspiration.  "I'm 
taking  one  of  these  to  all  my  friends  in  Holly- 
wood, "  she  explained.  Busy  lady  of  the  screen, 
on  a  brief  vacation  in  New  York,  a  thousand 
and  one  things  to  do!  Yet  finding  time  to  buy 
a  gift  for  each  friend,  and  a  charming  one  and 
a  practical  one! 

I  took  a  little  lesson  in  Christmas  giving  from 
Peggy.  That  day  of  days  is  just  around  the 
corner,  you  know,  and  there  are  mothers  and 
aunts  and  sisters  and  friends  to  think  about. 
If  you  are  in  a  quandary  about  gifts,  especially 
small  gifts,  do  give  something  for  beauty.  The 
costliest  of  perfumes  now  come  in  junior  sizes 
to  oblige  the  slimmest  of  purses,  both  in  size 
and  contents.  Even  modern  grandmothers 
thrill  to  new  and  lovely  perfumes. 

Then  there  are  compacts.  Who  ever  has 
enough  of  them?  Loose  powder,  compact  pow- 
der, rouge,  lipstick  or  even  an  accent  for  the 
eyes,  if  you  want  them  that  complete.  And 
such  adorable  cases.  It  seems  to  me  that  one 
of  the  most  gracious  of  American  gestures  to- 
day is  the  removal  of  a  lovely  compact  from 
a  smart  handbag.  Red  or  green  compacts 
accent  the  black  or  brown  costume;  white  is 
very  new,  a  perfect  touch  with  black  or  brown, 
also,  and  as  appropriate  for  evening  as  for  day. 
Or  you  may  prefer  blue;  indeed  any  shade  you 
desire  is  sure  to  be  found. 

Then  there  is  the  more  practical  aspect — 
complete  treatment  outfits,  effective,  cconom- 
ical,  gifts  that  do  something  grand  for  your 
face  and  your  spirits  as  well. 

94 


These  are  the  types  of  gifts  that  I  think  will 
be  more  welcome  than  ever  in  this  Christmas 
of  1932 — gifts  of  beauty,  gifts  that  carry  the 
true  spirit  of  Christmas.  Somehow,  I  think 
these  modern  jewels  of  beauty  are  not  far  re- 
moved from  those  ancient  gifts  of  gold  and 
frankincense  and  myrrh. 

"DANGS,  it  seems,  are  going  stronger  than

T_TOLLYWOOD,  which,  as  you  know,  goes 
*■  -^-blonde,  brunette,  platinum  or  red-head  at 
will,  now  adds  another  hair  shade  to  this  list. 
The  newest  is  blue  hair,  introduced  by  Beulah 
Christian,  an  atmosphere  player  in  "Evenings 
for  Sale. "  Miss  Christian  has  been  gray  since 
she  was  thirteen.  By  rinsing  her  hair  in  ordi- 
nary laundry  bluing  she  produces  a  bluish 
shade  which  she  finds  makes  her  either  a  blonde 
or  brunette  at  will.  The  shade  is  controlled  by 
the  amount  of  light  played  upon  her  hair. 
What  next? 

HpHE  pictures  of  Dorothy  Jordan,  which  you 
■*■  will  find  in  the  front  pages  of  this  depart- 
ment, were  taken  in  the  same  dressing-room 
at  the  Capitol  Theater  which  Dorothy  used 
several  years  ago  when  she  was  a  member  of  a 
Chester  Hale  dancing  group.  Now  Dorothy 
returns  to  the  same  room  as  a  star. 

pAULETTE  GODDARD'S  platinum  curls 
-*-  are  gradually  growing  out  in  their  natural 
light  brown  color,  in  anticipation  of  a  picture 
she  will  make  demanding  this  hair  shade.  When 
and  if  you  see  her  au  naturel,  I  think  you  will 
like  her  better.  In  spite  of  the  screen  popu- 
larity of  the  platinum  blonde,  sometimes  it 
places  the  player  at  a  disadvantage.  If  there 
are  still  readers  who  yearn  for  the  silver  locks, 
I  hope  they  will  pause  and  decide  that  blonde 
or  brown  locks  are  very  well  and  good.

Use  the  new  quick-dissolving  IVORY 
SNOW  when  you  wash  your  fine 
woolens.  It  is  pure  Ivory  Soap  ... 
safe  for  a  baby's  tender  skin  . . .  safe 
for  all  downy  and  silky  fleeces. 

DISSOLVES  AT  A  SWISH 
IN  LUKEWARM  WATER 
Ivory  Snow  is  not  cut  into  brittle, 
flat  flakes,  but  BLOWN  into  6oft 
round  particles  which  melt  like  snow 
itself.  You  don't  need  to  start  with 
hot  water  and  get  your  hands  so  hot 
that  they  can't  tell  when  the  suds 
have  cooled  enough  for  your  wool- 
ens. With  Ivory  Snow  you  can  begin 


with  safe,  lukewarm  water  and  in- 
stantly get  velvety  suds. 

NO  STIFF,  DISCOLORED  SOAP  SPOTS 

Ivory  Snow  dissolves  completely.  It 
has  no  flat  particles  that  can  stick  to 
fabrics  and  cause  soap  spots.  That 
is  why,  when  you  wash  your  woolens 
or  your  silks  in  Ivory  Snow,  they 
look  so  new — so  evenly  6oft  and 
clear  colored. 

Use  Ivory  Snow  lavishly  —  the 
extra-large  package  costs  only  15^. 
And  here's  a  tip  —  it  makes  the 
quickest,  thickest,  soft  -  on  -  your  - 
hands  suds  for  dishes! 


ADVICE  FROM  MAKERS  OF 

FINE  WOOLENS  AND  SILKS 

Ivory  Snow  is  "the  ideal  soap  for  woolens" 
agree  the  weavers  of  Biltmore  Handwoven 
Homespuns,  the  makers  of  downy  Mariposa 
blankets  and  the  Botany  Worsted  Mills. 
"A  perfect  soap  for  silks,"  say  Mallinson, 
Cheney  Brothers  and  Truhu.

Una  Merkel — once 
the  shyest  girl  in 
Hollywood — would 
you  believe  it?  She 
proves  that  any  girl 
can  clap  the  lid  on 
self-consciousness 


Maureen  O'Sulli- 
van  came  to  Holly- 
wood just  for  a  lark. 
Then  she  lost  her 
picture  contract, 
went  broke,  to  re- 
turn in  "Tarzan" 


and  made  more  good  pictures.  And  out  of  a 
clear  sky  she  fell  in  love  with  the  wrong  man. 
Hollywood  tried  to  tell  her.  To  warn  her. 
"But  I'm  sure  he's  sincere, "  she  insisted.  "I'm 
sure  of  it. "  But  he  wasn't.  And  it  broke  her 
heart.  She  lost  her  contract.  She  had  no 
money.  She,  who  had  always  had  plenty.  And 
for  the  first  time  in  her  life,  probably,  she  had 
to  fight  her  way  up  from  the  bottom. 

She  overcame  the  obstacle  of  extravagance. 
She  learned  to  economize.  To  listen  to  older 
and  wiser  heads.  When  M-G-M  finally  sent 
for  Maureen,  she  was  down  to  her  last  cent. 

She  came  back  in  "Tarzan, "  and  wen  a  con- 
tract. Today,  she's  a  new  Maureen.  Her 
money  is  carefully  saved.  Acting  in  pictures 
is  no  longer  just  a  new  thrill.  It's  a  serious  job 
to  do,  and  she's  overcome  that  terrific  handi- 
cap of  having  plenty  without  working  for  it. 

npHEY  called  Dorothy  Jordan  "Little  Mos- 
-*-  quito "  in  Hollywood.  Her  voice  was  a 
soft,  delicate  whirr,  her  clothes,  even  after  a 
year  on  Broadway,  were  hopelessly  small- 
townish.  She  had  no  vim  or  force,  self- 
assurance  or  poise.  She  was  quiet,  naive,  and 
looked  afraid. 

The  parade  in  Hollywood  moves  quickly. 
You've  got  to  keep  step  or  fall  behind.  Dor- 
othy, looking  about  her,  saw  the  whirl  and 
push,  knew  she  was  a  small  town  girl  in  a  big 
town  racket  and  would  have  to  get  over  it. 

She  practiced  things  with  that  voice.  It 
grew  and  expanded.  She  even  gathered  up 
enough  spunk  to  fight  for  good  parts.  She  put 
up  a  battle  for  "Min  and  Bill,"  and  got  it. 

She  looked  at  herself,  her  little  "down  South" 
dresses  and  knew  they  were  no  go  in  Holly- 
wood. So  one  day  it  was  a  blue  voile  and  the 
next  day  Hollywood  clutched  its  swollen,  ach- 
ing head  and  stared  in  alarm.  The  chic,  the 
smartness  of  that  Dorothy.  She  had  blos- 
somed into  a  seductive  butterfly.  Those 
clothes. 

A  few  short  months  ago  Dorothy  Wilson  sat 
pounding  a  typewriter  in  the  scenario  depart- 
ment of  tin-  Radio  Pictures  studios.  Just  a 
cute  little  stcnog.    Nothing  more. 

Today,  Dorothy's  a  movie  actress.  But  hold 
on  there,  Mamie,  it  didn't  happen  that  easily. 
You  can't  go  from  the  notion  counter  to  model- 
ing French  doo-dads  without  some  little  prep- 
aration, can  you?  No,  of  course  not.  Neither 
could  Dorothy.

Did  you  know  that  Jean  Harlow 
was  once  a  cripple?  As  a  child  she 
had  spinal  meningitis.  But  by  ex- 
ercise she  overcame  her  handicap 


Her  arms  were  long,  she  walked  awkwardly, 
she  hurried  her  lines — well,  name  about  any- 
thing that  isn't  right.    It  belonged  to  Dorothy. 

But  the  Dorothy  in  "The  Age  of  Consent" 
wasn't  so  bad,  was  she?  No,  indeed!  But 
you  should  have  seen  what  lay  between. 

Hours  of  practice.  Hours  of  study.  Hours 
of  watching.  Of  times  when  a  good  old  type- 
writer would  have  looked  like  a  gift  from 
heaven. 

Each  night  after  work,  when  her  feet  hurt, 
her  back  hurt,  her  feelings  hurt,  she  stayed 
and  went  over  the  next  day's  work  with  the 
director.    Over  and  over.    Over  and  over. 

And  then  she  went  home.  But  not  to  bed. 
Not  yet.  She  stood  before  her  mirror.  Going 
over  every  gesture,  every  word,  every  line. 

Finally,  bit  by  bit,  she  overcame  the  heart- 
breaking obstacle  of  being  an  awkward,  inex- 
perienced young  girl  to  blossom  into  a  good 
actress.  Most  girls  require  several  hard  years 
of  stage  training  to  make  the  transformation. 

Dot  made  it  in  those  several  months  of  in- 
tensive effort. 

But  she  wasn't  through.  She  must  have 
poise  and  self-assurance.    So  they  told  her  she 


must  make  a  personal  appearance  with  her 
picture. 

And  so,  with  knees  knocking  so  loudly  that 
a  stage  hand  looked  comically  around  and  said, 
"Come  in,"  with  hands  shaking  and  lips  quiv- 
ering, she  overcame  another  obstacle  on  the 
road  to  fame.  And  stepped  out  onto  that 
stage. 

They  sent  her  to  San  Francisco,  Salt  Lake 
City,  and  everywhere  "The  Age  of  Consent" 
went,  Dorothy — like  Mary's  lamh> — was  sure 
to  go.  And  gradually  stage  bowing  grew  less 
and  less  of  a  nightmare  and  Dorothy  acquired 
considerable  poise  and  self-assurance.  Another 
hurdle  taken. 

OH,  they  all  have  to  take  theirs  in  the  run 
for  fame,  Mamie.  Even  the  most  gorgeous 
beauties  of  them  have  hurdles  to  take.  Look 
at  Gwili  Andre.  And  isn't  that  an  easy  thing 
to  do?  But  what  good  is  a  beautiful  face  if, 
every  time  you  get  the  least  bit  excited,  your 
voice  squeals  like  a  fire  siren.  And  that,  horror 
of  horrors,  is  exactly  what  Gwili's  did.  Her 
voice  rose  to  high  heaven  every  time  she  was 
the  least  stirred  up.  And  you  know,  Mamie, 
if  you  know  anything,  you're  in  a  constant 
state  of  stir-up  in  these  movies. 

Well,  here  was  a  man's  size  obstacle,  if  ever 
there  was  one.  And  Gwili  made  it.  Here'show. 

She  used  the  gag  of  Demosthenes,  the  ancient 
Grecian  orator.  She  filled  her  beautiful  mouth 
with  pebbles  and  talked.  It  was  agony,  but 
she  did  it.  And  was  sure  she  was  full  of  pebbles 
after  every  lesson.    But  she  kept  on. 

She  overcame  that  squeak,  toned  her  voice 
down  to  a  lovely  evenness  and  so,  what? 

Una  Merkel  had  to  overcome  shyness.  She 
nearly  died  of  it.  But  now  she's  become  a 
miniature  Charlotte  Greenwood,  rolling  about 
and  making  a  cute  little  monkey  of  herself 
without  the  least  self-consciousness. 

Wynne  Gibson  has  had  to  overcome  the 
hard-boiled-sister  typing  that's  been  her  lot 
lately.  And  Wynne  has  waged  one  of  the  most 
beautiful  one-woman  battles  ever  waged, 
though  she  hasn't  got  it  licked  yet.  She  gained 
ground  in  "Clara  Deanc"  only  to  lose  it  again 
in  "Night  After  Night."  But  she'll  make  it. 
You'll  see! 

Just  try  to  realize  some  of  the  obstacles  these 
actresses  have  overcome  and  then,  instead  of 
going  into  fits  of  despair,  do  something  about 
it.     Shame  on  you,  Mamie!

When  he  was  cast  for  "Society  Girl"  with 
Jimmie  Dunn,  he  didn't  waste  a  moment  worry- 
ing about  which  man  would  get  the  best  of  the 
picture.  He  cultivated  Jimmie.  The  two  be- 
came friends.  Now,  two  leading  men  are  not 
supposed  to  be  friends  while  they  are  working 
together.  They  are  supposed  to  out-worry 
each  other;  try  to  steal  one  another's  scenes. 

The  moment  he  read  the  script  of  "The

It  couldn't  be  anything  else.  But  he  didn't 
worry.  Went  right  ahead  and  made  what  he 
knew  would  be  a  poor  production  without  say- 
ing a  word  about  it.  Taking  the  bad  with  the 
good. 

A  person  who  has  worked  on  the  Fox  lot  for 
ten  years  said,  recently:  "Spencer  Tracy  is  the 
most  nonchalant  person  I  ever  knew.  He 
seems  completely  indifferent  and  yet  he  can't 
be  because  he  always  turns  out  a  good  per- 
formance. He's  so  easy  and  natural  and  never 
asks  questions — I  can't  understand  him. " 

His  contract  comes  up  for  renewal  the  first 
of  the  year.  And  he's  not  worrying  about  that, 
either.  He  wouldn't  object  to  returning  to  the 
stage  for  a  play  or  two.  Either  way  it  goes  is 
all  right  with  him. 

And  he  hasn't  added  a  gray  hair  since  that 
memorable  evening  when  he  made  his  decision 
— Life  is  too  short  to  waste  any  part  of  it  in 
worry! 


Heart  Throb 


I'm  a  crippled  girl  twenty  years  old. 
No  one  knows  the  heart-aches,  the 
loneliness  in  those  three  words,  "a 
crippled  girl." 

When  my  sisters  dress  up  for  their 
beaus  and  their  parties  I  just  sit  and 
smile.  But  deep  in  my  heart  there's 
an  ache,  a  pain,  for  I'll  never  have  a 
beau  and  I  can  never  dance. 

I  sit  for  hours  in  my  wheel  chair 
reading  Photoplay  from  cover  to 
cover.  Then  in  the  evening,  dad  rolls 
me  to  the  nearest  picture  show,  and  in 
the  interest  of  watching  Jackie  Cooper, 
Sylvia  Sidney  and  others  I  forget  my 
misfortune.

Quick  relief  from  colds  plus 
66  cents  in  every  $1  saved 

PEPSODENT  ANTISEPTIC  is  3  times  as  powerful  as 
other  leading  mouth  antiseptics.  Hence  it  goes  3  times 
as  far.  And  whether  you  buy  the  25c,  50c,  or  $1 
size,  you  still  get  3  times  as  much  for  your  money. 


YOU'RE  trying  to  save  money.  But 
instead  of  saving  it  you're  losing  it 
if  you  don't  understand  the  difference 
between  Pepsodent  Antiseptic  and  the 
other  kinds  of  antiseptics.  There  really 
are  only  two  kinds  on  the  market.  In 
one  group  is  the  mouth  wash  that 
must  be  used  full  strength  to  be  effec- 
tive. In  the  other  group  is  Pepsodent 
Antiseptic — utterly  safe  when  used  full 
strength,  yet  powerful  enough  to  be 
diluted  with  2  parts  of  water  and  still 
kill  germs  in  less  than  10  seconds. 
Pepsodent  Antiseptic  is  at  least  three 
times  as  powerful  as  other  leading 
mouth  antiseptics.

Pepsodent  Antiseptic 


Eddie  Goes  Spanish 


[continued  from  pace  51 


Franklin  paused  to  gaze  at  his  eyebrows  in  a 
pocket  mirror  (he  was  sure  they  wouldn't 
photograph  well)  and  uttering  a  low  wail  of 
•loom,  loom,  loom,  loom,"  for  all  the  world 
like  a  jungle  drum,  stood  in  the  pen  completely 
surrounded  by  bulls.  "Toom,  toom,  toom, 
toom,"  the  low  cry  went  on  and,  suddenly,  the 
t  hull  was  advancing.  Bead  down. 
Coming  slowly  at  him.  "Toom,  toom,  toom, 
toom,"  he  was  coming. 

1 1 1  lowered  his  head,  the  deadly  horns  sweep- 
ing from  side  to  side.  He  reached  Franklin 
an  1  leaned  over  tenderly  while  Sidney  gently 
scratched  his  back. 

The  sun  sho  le  down  brightly  the  next  day, 
as  Eddie  and  Lyda  Roberti  stood  on  an  old 
Spanish  balcony  and  made  violent  love.  Eddie 
had  kissed  until  he  was  purple  in  the  face. 
And  still  the  director  wasn't  satisfied.  Over 
and  over,  he  took  the  giggling  Roberti  in  his 
Spanish  arms  and  made  Spanish  love  that  would 
surprise  any  Spaniard  living.  And  suddenly 
he  saw  them  down  there  below.  Two  of  his 
daughters.  Gazing,  pop-eyed  and  open- 
mouthed,  at  papa. 

He  leaned  over  the  balcony,  and  called  to 
them  softly.  "Listen,  children,  "  he  said, 
"don't  tell  mama.  Papa's  got  to  work  for  his 
living,  you  know.'' 

THE  next  scene  called  for  Eddie  to  be  tied 
on  a  pole,  with  wires,  and  swung  directly 
over  the  bulls'  pen.  Everything  was  set.  The 
lights  were  set,  the  camera  placed  and  the 
director  called,  "Cameras,  go,"  when  Eddie 
called,  "Stop,  I  forgot  something."  His 
secretary  came  running.  "Listen,"  said  Eddie, 
still  hanging   to   the   pole,   "did    I    say    five 


thousand  dollars  in  that  letter  or  five  hundred? 
I'ut  it  live  thousand  comma  and  not  a  cent  less, 
yours  very  truly,  Eddie  Cantor." 

And  the  shooting  continued. 

Finally  the  day  of  days  arrived.  The  big 
hull- light  where  Eddie  fight-a-de-bull-a.  He 
arrived  in  a  suit  completely  covered  with 
Christmas  tree  trimmings.  Eddie's  youngest 
took  one  look  and  ran  home  to  hang  up  her 
stocking.  You  could  almost  hear  Santa  and  his 
reindeer  in  the  distance.  Two  Spanish  clad 
attendants  stood  at  the  gates  that  opened  to 
the  bull  pen.  And,  inside  the  arena,  waiting 
for  friend  bull,  stood  Eddie.  His  cape  ready. 
His  banjo-eyes  fairly  popping. 

TTHE  grandstand  was  crowded  with  specta- 
*■  tors,  senoritas  in  lace  mantillas  and  Spanish 
lads  in  tight  pant-illas.  The  place  was  a  riot 
of  color,  while  beneath  the  surface  ran  a  tremor 
of  fear.  After  all,  a  bull  is  a  bull.  Even  in 
Hollywood. 

And  now,  everything  was  ready.  The  cam- 
eras were  placed  within  a  strong  stockade  at 
one  end  of  the  arena.  On  top,  just  out  of  reach, 
sat  the  director. 

The  signal  was  given.  The  gates  were 
opened.  The  sound  of  beating  hoofs  could  be 
heard.  The  bull  was  coming.  And  then.  There 
he  was.  Through  the  open  gates  he  plunged. 
Eddie  feebly  waved  his  cape  and  turned  a 
bilious  green.  On  came  the  bull.  Suddenly  it 
stopped  and  took  one  look  at  Eddie.  And 
never  budged  another  inch.  No  sir,  move  he 
wouldn't.  The  sight  of  Eddie  had  completely 
licked  him. 

Sidney  Franklin,  the  brave  matador,  stood 
outside  the  fence  and  poked  him  with  a  pole. 


Still  he  stood.  Then  Franklin,  the  hero  of 
Spain,  stood  outside  the  arena  and  calmly  shot 
pebbles  at  the  bull,  with  a  sbng  shot.  Oh,  if 
Spain  could  only  have  seen  that.  And  still  the 
bull  was  either  too  overcome  or  paralyzed  at 
the  sight,  to  move.    So  they  led  him  away. 

A  new  bull  was  tried.  The  plunging  hoofs 
sounded  harder  this  time.  And  then,  there  he 
was.  In  the  arena.  A  huge  tuft  of  red  hair, 
like  a  grotesque  wig,  grew  outfrom  between  his 
horns.  Eddie  took  one  look.  "My  Gawd,"  he 
screamed,  "it's  Harpo  Marx."  And  ran  for 
his  life,  with  Harpo  after  him. 

Through  the  safety,  he  tore.  And  through 
the  safety,  the  bull  tore.  Snorting  and  bellow- 
ing. Now,  he  was  out  of  the  arena.  People 
were  screaming.  The  assistant  director  took 
one  look  and  made  for  the  Hollywood  hills. 
He  isn't  back  yet.  Someone  ran  for  Goldwyn. 
Castro,  a  brave  little  Mexican  matador,  waved 
his  cape.  The  bull  plunged.  And  missed  him 
by  an  inch.  And  then  it  spotted  Eddie  half 
way  over  the  fence  and  straight  for  the  rear  of 
Eddie,  he  made.  There  was  a  loud  roar.  And 
the  "Kid  from  Spain"  suddenly  took  an  unex- 
pected and  unplanned  journey  through  the  air 
and  landed,  over  the  fence,  in  the  fat  Spanish 
lap  of  an  extra  woman  in  the  top  row. 

'"THE  gate  boy  ran  screaming  to  the  director. 
*•  "Say,  a  bull  just  now  checked  out  the  front 
gate.    Shall  I  mark  him  off  the  payroll?" 

While  Eddie  lay  gasping  and  gurgling,  in 
the  grandstand.  Dictating  a  letter.  "Ten 
thousand  or  nothing.  Yours  truly,  Eddie 
Cantor." 

And  thus  we  go  Spanish.  Castoroila,  Hunk- 
adoria,  Adios! 


Ah,  There,  It's  Chic  Himself 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  76 


moment's  conversation.  The  watery  blue  eyes 
turned  yearningly  toward  the  kitchen,  wan- 
dered along  the  living  trail  of  hungry  humans 
that  separated  him  from  the  meager  handout, 
back  to  the  end  of  the  long  line. 

"Could  you  wait — just  a  little?"  the  old 
voice  quavered.  "I  been  here  for  two  hours, 
an'  if  I  step  out  now,  I'll  lose  my  place. " 

"Come  along,  dad,"  Chic  smiled  kindly. 
"We'll  go  over  to  the  restaurant  and  have  our 
talk  over  a  real  meal." 

Wondcringly,  the  old  man  followed  him,  and, 
over  a  steaming,  soul-satisfying  dinner,  they 
talked. 

In  a  few  words,  Chic  explained  his  mission. 
He  wanted  that  suit. 

The  blue  eyes  were  perplexed.  "Why,  I'd 
be  glad  to  give  it  to  you,  mister,  but — "  apolo- 
getically— "you  see,  it's  the  only  suit  I  got." 

"I'll  take  care  of  that,"  Chic  assured  him. 
And,  an  hour  later  they  emerged  from  a  nearby 
haberdashery,  two  happy,  satisfied  men. 

Chic  was  in  possession  of  the  frayed  suit, 
and  the  old  man,  newly  outfitted  from  top  to 
toe,  a  ten  dollar  bill  in  his  trousers'  pocket, 
looked  as  imposingly  prosperous  as  a  United 
States  senator. 

"DORN  and  raised  in  a  typical  small  town.  Chic 
-'-'has  known  personally  every  character  he 
portrays. 

His  characterizations  arc  honest  and  true  to 
life,  and  anyone  raised  in  the  confines  of  an 
American  village  will  have  little  difficulty  in 
recognizing  the.  authenticity  of  his  portrayals. 

Chic's  respect  and  honest  affection  for  the 

98 


characters  he  depicts  is  as  sincere  as  the  man 
himself.  To  bring  them  to  the  screen,  hon- 
estly and  sympathetically;  to  encourage  the 
movie-going  public  to  know  and  love  them  as 
he  does,  is  his  greatest  desire. 

/^\FF  the  screen,  Chic  Sale  is  unbelievably 
^-^ young  and  personable.  To  his  great  amuse- 
ment, no  one  recognizes  him. 

Attending  the  premiere  of  "The  Expert," 
he  fooled  the  curious  on-lookers  completely. 

As  he  entered  the  theater,  someone  "in  the 
know"  exclaimed,  "There's  Chic  Sale!"  and 
immediately  a  thousand  eyes  looked  toward 
him,  only  to  turn  away,  still  eagerly  seeking  a 
glimpse  of  the  star. 

A  fluttery,  celebrity-chasing  dowager 
touched  his  arm. 

"Pardon  me,  but  the  announcer  said  Mr. 
Sale  came  in  just  now.  I'm  dying  to  get  a  look 
at  him!    Did  you  see  him?" 

"Sure,"  Chic  told  her.  "He  just  went 
around  that  corner." 

And,  without  even  pausing  to  thank  him, 
the  curious  lady  dashed  off  in  pursuit  of  the 
very  gentleman  she  had  unwittingly  addressed! 

Once,  when  he  was  playing  in  a  musical 
show,  he  registered  at  a  hotel  in  Denver. 

The  desk  clerk,  who  had  seen  the  show,  took 
advantage  of  the  opportunity  to  ask  a  few 
questions. 

"What  do  you  do  with  the  old  fellow  in  the 
show?"  he  said  curiously.  "He's  so  feeble.  I 
should  think  this  traveling  around  all  the  time 
would  be  pretty  hard  on  him?" 

"Oh,  I  take  care  of  him,"  Chic  replied  se- 


riously. "He's  huskier  than  you'd  think,  to 
look  at  him. " 

"Well,  I  don't  know,"  the  fellow  shook  his 
head  dubiously,  "he  looks  mighty  shaky  to 
me." 

In  the  Grand  Central  station,  Chic  encoun- 
tered one  of  his  funniest  and  most  expensive 
adventures. 

A  typical  small-town  smart  aleck  stepped 
jauntily  from  the  train,  yellow  gloves  in  one 
hand  and  a  nineteenth  century  valise  in  the 
other. 

His  suit,  a  trifle  tight  in  spots,  lavender 
shirt,  brilliant  tie  and  socks,  and  the  moun- 
tainous-toed, brown  buttoned  shoes  he  wore, 
shrieked  loudly  of  desperate  conniving  with  a 
popular  mail  order  house. 

Gleefully,  Chic  pounced  upon  his  "find. " 

"I'm  Chic  Sale,"  he  said,  by  way  of  intro- 
duction, "and  I'd  like  to  have  that  suit  you're 
wearing.    How  much  would  you  take  for  it?" 

The  fellow  regarded  him  suspiciously. 
"  Never  heard  of  ya, "  he  said,  not  too  gra- 
ciously. "  Whadda  ya  want  with  my  suit,  any- 
how?" 

CHIC  explained  that  he  was  a  vaudevillian 
and  wanted  to  use  it  in  his  act. 

"It's  just  what  I've  been  looking  for,"  he 
continued.  "I  hope  you'll  consent  to  part 
with  it?" 

"Aw.  I  dunno  ..."  the  small-town  Lo- 
thario considered  doubtfully.  "There  ain't 
another  like  it  in  th'  whole  dern  county." 

"It  certainly  is  one  in  a  million!"  Chic 
agreed  warmly. 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  December,  1932 

"But — I  guess  if  it's  worth  enough  to  ya 

Reaching  into  his  pocket,rChic  drew  out  his 
billfold  and  extracted  several  bills.  With  the 
money  almost  in  his  hand,  the  bucolic  man-of- 
the-world  drew  back. 

"  Jest  a  minute, "  he  said  cautiously.  "  Don't 
crowd  me!  You  city  fellers  are  pretty  fast. 
How'd  I  know  but  mebbe  that's  counterfeit 
money?" 

"Well,  let's  see,"  Chic  considered,  quaking 
with  inward  laughter.  "  Suppose  I  take  you  to 
a  store,  let  you  pick  out  any  suit  you  want,  in 
exchange  for  the  one  you're  wearing,  and  pay 
for  it?    Would  that  make  it  all  right?" 

Failing  to  see  where  he  could  possibly  lose 
by  the  arrangement,  the  doubting  Thomas 
went  along  with  our  generous  hero  to  the  near- 
est haberdashery. 

"Any  one  I  want?"  he  asked,  eyeing  some 
nifty  plaids  on  a  fifteen-dollar  rack. 

"Any  one  you  want!"  Chic  assured  him 
magnanimously,  reasonably  confident  that  his 
suggestion  had  been  both  wise  and  economical. 

TV  7ARILY,  the  cautious  chap  went  from 
W  rack  to  rack  until,  finally,  accompanied 
by  the  enthusiastic  salesman,  he  disappeared 
into  a  fitting  room  at  the  rear  of  the  store. 

Fifteen  minutes  later,  he  emerged,  resplend- 
ent in  a  striking  model  of  British  make. 

"Okay,"  he  grinned  happily.    "This  is  her!" 

Chic  took  one  look  at  the  tag  and  groped  for 
a  chair.    The  price  was  seventy-five  dollars! 

"Well,  I  paid  for  'her,'  "  Chic  chuckled,  as 
we  finished  our  coffee  in  his  dressing  room  on 
the  M-G-M  lot.  "But  it  was  a  long  time  be- 
fore I  recovered  enough  to  go  on  any  more 
clothes  hunts!" 

Simple  and  honest,  with  a  boundless  faith 
in  and  understanding  of  humanity,  Chic  Sale 
is  one  of  the  best  loved  characters  on  the 
screen  today. 

His  ability  to  combine  humor  and  pathos, 
the  tear  and  the  smile,  successfully,  is  unsur- 
passed. 

Real  folks,  that's  Chic.

Their  Real  Roles  Were  Tragedy 


[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  47  ] 


too  bad.  But  instantly  he  saw  the  little  fellow 
was  in  earnest.  Charlie  actually  believed  the 
tragedy  of  tragedies  had  happened.  His 
radiator  was  warm. 

So   without  saying  a  word,   the  mechanic 
calmly  hooked  onto  Charlie's  car  and  b 
it  in.    Charlie  continued  his  way  on  the  street 
car,  and  gratefully  paid  the  towing  fee. 

Then  there  was  the  time  Sennett  was  called 
bo  New  York  on  business.  They  had  a  man 
posted  to  watch  the  day  he  returned.  He 
arrived  to  find  an  apparently  deserted  studio. 
He  ran  wildly,  linen  duster,  goggles  and  all, 
from  corner  to  corner.  Calling  for  Fatty,  for 
Mabel,  for  Chaplin.  He  was  almost  wild  with 
despair  when  they  finally  ran  out  from  hiding. 

•TMAGIXi:,"  Fatty  said  to  me  just  last  week, 
■'■"imagine  a  whole  studio  taking  time  out  to 
play  a  joke  on  a  producer  today." 

It  was  grand  fun,  this  bringing  laughter 
and  happiness  to  the  world.  To  a  world  that 
forgot  so  easily  when  these  three  needed  a  bit 
of  friendly  understanding. 

Mabel,  Charlie  and  Fatty.  As  far  apart  in 
temperament  as  the  poles,  they  were  welded 
together  by  a  bond  of  friendship  and  mutual 
love  of  their  work. 

Gradually  these  three  forged  ahead.  The 
name  Muriel  Fortesque  was  dropped.  Mabel 
took  her  own  name.  Charlie's  name  was 
almost  a  by-word.    Everyone  knew  Fatty. 

Big  names  now.  Big  money.  Big  pictures. 
Success.  And  with  it  came  big  heartaches. 
And  came  with  a  suddenness  that  nearly 
knocked  the  ropes  from  under  them. 

Mabel's  came  first.  One  day  it  was  Mabel 
in  "Mickey."  Remember  the  song,  "Mickey. 
Pretty  Mickey"?  And  Mabel's  swell  per- 
formance? And  tousled  curls  and  big,  laugh- 
ing eyes?  The  world  fairly  cheered  her.  And 
then  as  quickly  it  forgot  her,  apparently.  She 
appeared  in  no  more  pictures.  A  love  affair, 
which  turned  out  badly,  sent  her  into  seclusion. 

"I'd  go  home  from  the  studio,"  Fatty  said, 
"and  the  butler  (yes,  he  was  in  the  butler 
class  now)  would  meet  me  at  the  door  with, 
'Miss  Xormand  and  her  books  arrived  today, 
sir.  She  just  wants  you  to  go  on  as  if  she 
weren't  here.  She  doesn't  want  to  bother  you 
or  interfere  with  your  plans.  I  took  the 
liberty  of  taking  her  dinner  up  on  a  tray,  sir.' 

"In  the  daytime  she'd  sit  out  in  the  garden 
and  read,"  Fatty  said.  "The  butler  told  me 
she's  go  right  out  after  I'd  leave  for  the  studio 
and  read  all  day.  She  knew  what  she  read, 
too.  As  smart  a  woman  as  I  ever  knew.  Away 
over  my  head.  And  there  she'd  sit,  and  never 
ask  for  one  thing.  She  would  eat  when  and 
if  they  brought  her  anything.  Then  back  she 
would  steal  to  her  room. " 

A  XD  while  the  laughter  and  the  merry- 
■*»-making,  the  gay  times  went  on  downstairs, 
not  a  soul  dreamed  that,  locked  upstairs  in  a 
back  room,  Mabel  Xormand  sat  alone,  with 
her  books.  The  house  of  her  old  friend  was 
the  only  quiet  refuge  she  had  in  those  troubled 
times. 

"Maybe  a  week  later,"  Arbuckle  said,  "the 
butler  would  tell  me  she  had  gone,  with  her 
books." 

A  week!  And  in  all  his  busy,  popular  days, 
he  hadn't  as  much  as  glimpsed  her,  for  Fatty 
was  a  big  star  then.  He  was  surrounded  by 
mobs,  hangers-on. 

Money  poured  in.  He  was  young.  Life  was 
grand. 

But  suddenly  fate  stalked  another  member 
of  the  trio. 

A  death.  And  Fatt) — good  natured,  lovable 
Fatty — of  all  people,  held  responsible. 

Xo  words  can  depict  the  horror,  the  terror, 
the  ghastliness  of  the  moment. 

100 


Fatty,  who  had  given  years  to  bringing  fun 
into  drab,  every-day  life,  was  accused.  Ac- 
quitted by  the  court,  he  was  found  guilty  by 
the  very  people  who  had  drunk  in  so  greedily 
all  he  had  to  give  through  the  years.  Done,  at 
the  very  peak  of  his  career.  Through.  -Wis 
mind  turned  to  Mabel  now,  and  to  Charlie, 
going  on  without  him. 

But  Mabel  didn't  go  on. 

More  scandal  came.  A  shooting  in  which 
Mabel  had  no  part.  But  who  cared  about 
that?  Mabel  was  in  and  that  was  all  the 
world  needed  to  know.  Headlines  shrieked 
her  name.    Eyebrows  were  raised.    The  hap- 


No,  this  is  not  Sally  Eilers  dressing 
up  in  an  old  coat  from  the  attic — it  is 
Sally  wearing  the  very  latest  word  in 
evening  wraps.  Turquoise  blue  vel- 
vet makes  it  even  more  reminiscent 
of  the  "mauve  decade."  Long  tight 
sleeves  of  ermine  meet  the  pufF 
sleeves  of  velvet.  The  neckline  is 
finished  with  an  ermine  scarf  and  the 
coat  sweeps  into  a  regal  train  at  back 


piness  she  had  brought,  the  thousand  and 
one  things,  wonderful  things,  she  had  done 
were  shrugged  away. 

It  crushed  the  spirit  out  of  her.  The 
radiant,  bubbling  smile  came  slower  now. 

And  she  had  just  learned  to  smile  again,  to 
burst  forth  into  peals  of  laughter,  to  open  her 
brown  eyes  to  the  joy  of  living,  when  this 
blow  fell,  as  if  fate  had  said,  "Don't  smile. 
Don't  look  up.  I  haven't  finished  with  you 
yet." 

A  XOTHER  mess.     And  Mabel  again  m- 
■**-nocently  involved. 

Those  who  saw  her  at  the  time  still  remember 
her  cries,  "Don't,  don't,"  she  begged,  "don't 
do  with  me  as  you  did  with  Fatty.  Don't 
keep  me  off  the  screen. " 

But  Mabel  Xormand  never  went  back  to 
the  screen.  Her  health  broke,  along  with  her 
heart.  But  her  irrepressible  good  humor  shone 
through  to  the  last.  Grateful  for  every  little 
favor — a  book,  a  small  bouquet,  even  a  card, 
bringing  tears  of  gratitude  to  her  eyes.  Mabel, 
who  gave  so  much. 

And  Charlie,  the  third  member  of  the  trio, 
the  only  one  to  go  on — what  of  Charlie? 

To  him,  the  funny  little  duck  from  London, 
has  come,  perhaps,  the  greatest  tragedy  of  all. 
For  what,  after  all,  is  the  meaning  of  success, 
after  long  years  of  toil,  of  fame,  of  money,  if 
we  are  unable  to  share  it  with  those  we  love? 
To  bring  them  a  share  of  happiness,  too? 
Just  ashes. 

Haunted  always  by  the  poverty  of  his  child- 
hood, of  the  terrific  struggle  of  his  mother  to 
keep  more  life  in  the  bodies  of  her  boys,  he 
dreamed  of  the  time,  just  as  every  one  does, 
when  success  would  come  and  he  could  dump 
all  the  luxuries  of  the  world  into  the  lap  of  his 
mother  and  say,  "Look,  mother.  It's  for  you. 
All  for  you. " 

This  was  denied  Charlie  Chaplin. 

When  success  came  to  him,  his  mother, 
broken  by  the  long,  pitiful  struggle,  never  knew 
her  son  had  reached  the  peak.  Her  mind  was 
clouded. 

It  always  remained  with  its  poverty.  All 
the  beautiful  things  Charlie  heaped  upon  her, 
the  comforts,  the  luxuries,  meant  nothing. 
They  came  too  late. 

To  want  to  give,  to  repay,  and  can't,  is,  no 
doubt,  the  greatest  tragedy  of  all. 

And  again  the  same  fate  that  pursued  Mabel 
and  Fatty  (for  every  venture  Fatty  embarked 
upon  proved  a  failure)  marked  Charlie  for  its 
own. 

Two  unhappy  marriages. 

The  first  to  Mildred  Harris.  Charlie  was 
almost  childish  in  his  happiness.  A  baby  was 
coming. 

He  talked  of  nothing  else.  His  career, 
everything  was  forgotten  in  the  anticipation 
of  the  little  son  who  was  to  come. 

It  came.  Charlie's  little  son,  and  lingered 
just  a  few  short  hours.  And  with  its  passing, 
a  part  of  Charlie  Chaplin  died.  Something 
spontaneous,  alive,  eager,  died  within  him. 

He  buried  it,  this  "Little  Mouse,"  as  he 
called  it,  on  a  warm,  sunny  morning.  And 
into  that  little  grave  went  the  heart  of  Chap- 


A^TLDRED  and  Charlie,  entirely  unsuited, 
•^Vl-soon  separated. 

The  headlines  carrying  the  details.  And 
then  another  marriage  came  to  Chaplin. 
Another  woman  not  suited  to  his  temperament. 

Two  boys  were  born.  Then  came  that  bitter 
divorce  that  drove  Charlie  Chaplin,  then  in 
Xew  York,  to  his  bed,  to  toss  about  in  a  delir- 
ium of  fever. 

He  suffered  in  those  days,  perhaps  deeper 
than  had  Fatty  or  Mabel.

He  emerged  from  his  troubles  a  man  changed 
with  sorrow,  his  hair  white. 

But  Charlie's  troubles  weren't  all  behind 
him — not  yet. 

Only  a  few  weeks  ago  he  arose  from  a  bed  of 
illness  to  fight  in  a  crowded  court-room  for  a 
normal,  carefree  boyhood  for  little  Sydney  and 
Charles  Jr.,  his  boys. 

Mrs.  Chaplin  had  arranged  a  movie  contract 
for  her  and  the  two  boys.  A  large  sum  of 
money  was  to  be  paid  for  the  boys'  services. 

"I  have  provided  well  for  my  boys,"  Charlie 
said  very  quietly  from  his  place  on  the  witness 
stand.  "Please.  I  know  what  it  means  to 
work  while  other  children  play.  This  will  do 
something  to  my  boys,  influence  their  whole 
lives.    Please,"  he  begged. 

HpHE  judge  decided  he  was  right.  But  it 
■*-  isn't  over.  Long,  harrowing  court  scenes 
may  loom  ahead  in  which  Chaplin  will  have 
to  fight  and  fight. 

No,  his  troubles  aren't  behind  him. 

But  Mabel's  fitful  life  is  over.  Her  troubles 
are  behind  her.  Mabel  is  at  rest.  In  a  quiet 
spot  with  a  shady  tree  waving  above,  Mabel 
rests,  safe  from  any  more  worldly  heartaches. 

"It  wasn't  the  big  names,  the  big  people, 
the  big  successes,  Mabel  bothered  with,"  Fatty 
said  of  her.  "It  was  the  underdog,  the  one 
who  never  quite  made  the  grade,  the  poor,  the 
forgotten,  that  Mabel  loved  best. " 

Yes,  Mabel  rests. 

But  will  the  injustice  done  Mabel  Normand 
be  a  lesson  to  those  who  judge  blindly  and 
cruelly? 

Roscoe  Arbuckle  has  begged  for  another 
chance. 

Through  long,  weary  years  he  has  begged  to 
come  back. 

And  now  he's  been  given  his  chance. 

He  stood,  not  so  long  ago,  before  a  micro- 
phone for  the  first  time. 

He  was  to  laugh,  to  mimic,  to  bring  back  all 
the  old  Arbuckle  humor. 

Instead,  he  stood  there,  very  still.  And  two 
large  tears  rolled  down  his  face.  It  was  here. 
He  was  doing  the  thing  he  wanted  to  do  for  all 
those  years,  and  it  was  too  much  for  him. 

Openly  and  shamelessly  he  wept,  while  all 
about  him  strong,  hard-boiled  workmen  blew 
loudly  into  handkerchiefs,  and  wept  with  him. 

He's  trying  again.  They  cheered  him  long 
and  loudly  in  New  York. 

He  may  make  it.  But  comedy  has  changed, 
lives  have  changed  and  fans  have  changed. 

And  Fatty  knows  it. 

But,  at  least,  he's  having  another  chance. 

No,  it's  Chaplin,  with  all  his  money  and 
fame,  who  looks  long  and  deepest  into  a  lonely 
future. 

We  sat  next  to  his  table  in  a  Hollywood  res- 
taurant shortly  after  he  came  back  from  Eu- 
rope. 

He  and  his  companion  laughed  gaily  and 
happily. 

Then,  suddenly,  into  his  eyes  came  a  far-off 
look,  a  deep,  troubled  look.  His  companion 
would  lay  a  white  hand  on  his  arm  and  in- 
stantly he  was  back  again,  laughing  and  chat- 
ting. 

But  just  a  little  later  he  would  be  gazing 
again,  far  off  into  some  mysterious  future — or 
past,  perhaps. 

T  COULDN'T  help  but  wonder  if  sometimes 
■*■  he  isn't  looking  back  to  a  big  lumbering  fat 
man  walking  across  a  crude  movie  lot,  saying, 
"Arbuckle  is  my  name,  Roscoe  Arbuckle. " 

"Normand's  mine,"  a  little  imp  replies, 
"Mabel  Normand.  And  the  funny  little  duck 
over  there  with  the  cock-eyed  feet,  is  Charlie, 
Charlie  Chaplin." 

And  the  little  fellow  strolls  over  and  they 
stand  there  together. 

A  strange  trio! 

Bound  together  with  a  strange  bond  of 
friendship  and  a  mutual  love  of  work. 

Bound  closer  together  twenty  years  later  by 
a  strange  and  fearful  bond  of  tragedy.  Of  a 
fate  that  had  even  then  marked  for  its  own — 
Mabel,  Fatty  and  Charlie.

Up  the  Ladder  with  Jeanette 


□TOED  FROM  PAGE  77  | 


discover  there  was  no  vacancy.  The  girl  had 
decided  to  stay.    Here  was  a  fine  how-to-do. 

Hut  (and  jot  this  down  in  your  notebook,  you 
aspiring  young  artists)  Jeanette  stayed  and 
henpecked  and  tortured  everyone  until  she  got 
a  job  right  in  "Nightboat."  And  while-  Ernest 
Torrence,  Willie  Collier,  Sr.,  Hal  Skilly  and 
the  White  sisters  spoke  the  lines,  Jeanette 
romped  in  the  chorus. 

AND  tlun  a  certain  gentleman  connected 
with  Mr.  Dillingham's  office  took  a  great 
interest  in  Jeanette.  She  rehearsed  whole 
plays  for  him.  Took  to  her  singing  in  earnest 
and  worked  diligently.  And  then  one  night  he 
suddenly  seized  her  in  his  arms.  He  pressed 
his  mouth  on  hers  and  held  her  tightly  while  he 
promised  much.  She  struggled  free.  And 
knew  she  must  make  a  decision  quickly. 

She  made  it.  And  it  cost  her  her  job  in 
"Nightboat."  And  it  was  exactly  eight 
months  before  she  got  another  bit  of  work  to 
do. 

Jeanette  MacDonald  thinks  it  wouldn't  be 
fair  to  talk  about  her  ten  long,  weary  years  of 
struggle  without  mentioning  that  unfortunate 
episode.  She  managed  to  succeed  on  her  own. 
Her  success  belongs  to  herself.  And  she 
wouldn't  trade  that  knowledge  for  five  years  of 
life.  Now  mind,  the  going  was  rougher.  And 
slower.  But  if  you  think  success  can't  come  by 
being  true  to  oneself,  look  at  Jeanette.  In  fact, 
she  wants  you  to.  And  to  know.  And  she 
isn't  preaching,  either. 

Days  of  weary  tramping.  Weeks  of  haunt- 
ing stulTy  offices.  Trudging,  tramping  streets. 
But  behind  her  stood  a  loyal  dad  and  mother. 
And  now  a  word  to  these  other  mothers  and 
fathers  of  young  world-beaters.  If  you  could 
know,  Jeanette  claims,  how  much  it  means  to 
have  someone  believe  in  you.  To  stand  behind 
you.  When  feet  are  weary  and  heart  is  sore,  to 
have  someone  steal  into  one's  room  at  night 
and  whisper,  "It's  all  right,  honey,  I  know 
you're  good.    I  believe  in  you."    It  helps. 

And  then  came  a  chance  to  try  out  for  Mr. 
Savage  in  a  show  starring  Mitzi  Hajos,  the 
little  Hungarian  actress.  She  rolled  her  music 
under  her  arm,  pulled  on  her  galoshes  and 
went.  The  music  was  a  little  high  and  she 
asked  the  accompanist  to  play  it  an  octave 
lower.  So  they  began.  He  playing  it  exactly 
as  it  was  written.  She  stood  there  alone  on  the 
stage  and  sang.  And  suddenly  she  came  to  the 
high  note  and  she  couldn't  make  it.  She  froze 
in  horror.    Her  voice  cracked. 

She  looked  down  at  Mr.  Savage.  "Why,  I 
always  could  take  that  note."  she  said.  "Well, 
never  mind,"  he  said,  "let's  see  you  dance." 
So  Jeanette  removed  her  galoshes  and  went 
into  her  dance.  Halfway  through  she  sprawled 
flat  on  her  face.  Slowly  she  gathered  herself  up. 
"I — I  think  you  make  me  nervous,"  she  said, 
and  went  home.  The  next  day  he  sent  for  her. 
She  had  the  part. 

A  XD  then  Jeanette's  father  died.  And 
-'^everything  depended  on  her.  Somehow  her 
shows  kept  folding  up  under  her.  And  then 
there  would  be  months  and  months  of  more 
tramping. 

It  was  tragic.  So  often  the  golden  apple  was 
held  out,  only  to  be  snatched  away.  She  never 
managed  to  find  herself  in  a  hit. 

She  took  a  test  for  Warner  Brothers  that  was 
a  darb.  She  looked  exactly  like  old  aunt 
Dinah. 

For  some  reason  she  had  photographed  a 
dark  brunette. 

She  was  down  to  the  last  dollar  of  her  savings 
when  the  chance  came  to  play  in  "Yes,  Yes, 
Yvette."  Jeanette  isn't  sure  whether  she  was 
the  Yes,  Yes,  or  ju>t  Yvette  and  even  if  it 
wasn't  the  biggest  hit  in  the  world  her  name 

102 


went  up  in  lights  and  Maurice  Chevalier  came 
to  America.     Two  great  events  in  her  life. 

Lubitsch  was  hunting  a  leading  lady  for 
"The  Love  Parade."  He'd  seen  every  one  in 
New  York. 

And  then  he  came  back  to  Hollywood  and 
began  looking  at  old  tests.  And  there  was 
one  Paramount  had  made  of  Jeanette  and 
forgotten  about. 

Her  show  was  in  Chicago.  He  went  to  see 
her.  "You  are  too  thin,"  he  told  her.  "You 
must  gain  fifteen  pounds  at  least."  So 
Jeanette  set  about  gaining  fifteen  pounds  by 
worrying  herself  silly  and  not  sleeping  nights. 
She  ate  potatoes  during  the  day  and  then 
worried  away  two  pounds  for  fear  she  wouldn't 
gain  fifteen. 

So  she  left  the  show  and  went  to  a  milk 
farm.  She  would  gain  weight  or  die.  And 
she  nearly  died. 

Appendicitis  overcame  her  and  when  the 
once  vivacious  Miss  MacDcnald  stepped  from 
the  train  in  Hollywood  some  few  weeks  later, 
Herr  Lubitsch  took  one  look  and  gasped, 
"Mein  Gott,  I'm  ruined,"  for  she  weighed 
exactly  twenty-five  pounds  less  than  she  had 
in  the  beginning. 

But  she  drank  milk  on  the  set  and  ate  candy. 
And  as  the  picture  progressed  she  grew  rounder. 
In  fact,  life  as  a  queen  agreed  with  her.  By  the 
end  of  the  picture  she  was  just  right. 


The  big  muffs,  like  those  your  mothers 
used  to  carry,  are  back!  Constance 
Bennett  shows  how  stunning  is  one  in 
fox  to  match  a  huge  blue  fox  collar  on 
her  ensemble.  She  carries  the  muff  on 
her  right  arm— it  almost  looks  like  one 
big  cuff,  doesn't  it?  Note  the  three- 
quarter  length  of  the  blue  woolen 
coat.    The  hat  is  fabric  and  ribbon 


But  something  happened  during  the  making 
of  the  picture  that,  she  feels,  may  have 
hindered  her  success.  Just  a  little  thing,  of 
course,  but  little  things  count.  So  if  you  do 
reach  the  top  as  Jeanette  finally  did,  watch  for 
them. 

The  vogue  for  false  eyelashes  had  just 
reached  Hollywood.  And  no  matter  how  long 
or  thick  one's  own  lashes  might  be,  false  ones 
had  to  be  worn.  No  one  knew  exactly  why,  but 
they  did.  So  Jeanette  was  handed  a  pair  of 
lashes  and  put  them  on.  They  didn't  want  her 
to  see  the  daily  rushes.  But  after  several  days 
of  suspense  she  sneaked  in,  and  the  sight  of 
herself  in  those  lashes  about  finished  her.  They 
did  something  strange  to  her  eyes.  So  without 
saying  a  word  to  anyone,  she  appeared  the  next 
day  with  her  own  lashes. 

No  one  noticed  a  thing.  But  a  day  or  so 
later  Lubitsch  came  over  and  peered  at  her 
closely.  "Have  you  done  anything  to  your- 
self?" he  demanded.  "You  look  different." 
"  Why,  no,"  Jeanette  assured  him,  she  hadn't. 

A  GAIN  he  peered  at  her  closely.  "Open 
-**-your  mouth,"  he  commanded.  He  peered 
anxiously  down  her  throat.  "Huh,"  he  ex- 
claimed, "everything  seems  to  be  there." 

"Maybe  it's  the  eyelashes,"  Jeanette  ven- 
tured. And  he  hit  the  ceiling  with  a  bang. 
She  had  ruined  his  picture.  But  Jeanette  knew 
in  her  heart  the  lashes,  for  her,  were  wrong. 
They  viewed  the  rushes  together  that  night  and 
agreed.  Be  sure  you  know  what  is  right,  and 
stick  to  it.    But  be  sure,  first. 

Now,  many  an  actress  has  come  to  the  screen 
from  the  musical  comedy  stage  and  flopped. 
One  or  two  pictures,  and  their  career  on  the 
screen  was  over.  Grace  Moore,  of  the  ex- 
quisite voice,  is  an  example.  Marilyn  Miller, 
another.  But  Jeanette  has  gone  on  to  bigger 
and  better  pictures.  She  holds  a  unique  place 
on  the  screen.  And  guards  it  carefully.  It 
isn't  enough  to  have  arrived,  you  know.  A 
place  at  the  top  must  be  held  and  fought  for,  if 
necessary.  And  with  her  far-seeing  manager, 
Bob  Richie,  Jeanette  MacDonald  has  waged  a 
beautiful  battle. 

For  instance,  she  has  no  contract.  And 
won't  accept  one.  And  fancy  that,  in  a  con- 
tract-grabbing land.  But  her  bitter  taste  of 
mediocre  pictures  that  followed  "The  Love 
Parade"  showed  her  the  pitfalls  that  await 
young  actresses  from  the  musical  stage.  So  she 
picks  and  chooses  and  does  a  good  job  of  it.  if 
you  ask  Hollywood.  "Monte  Carlo,"  "One 
Hour  With  You,"  and  "Love  Me  Tonight" 
were  hits. 

She  turned  down  the  lead  in  "  Back  Street." 
It  wasn't  for  her,  she  felt.  Someone  could  do 
better  than  she  in  the  part.  And  she  was  right. 
Irene  Dunne  was  perfect  as  Ray  Schmidt. 

BENEATH  that  red-gold  hair  is  a  lot  of  hard, 
common  sense.  She  has  builded  this  beauti- 
ful, glamorous  woman  from  material  that  was 
not  one  bit  richer  than  yours.  It's  the  truth, 
I  promise  you. 

As  a  kid  she  was  known  as  "broomstick  legs." 
"Hey,  hey,"  the  kids  taunted,  "there  goes 
broomstick  legs."  And  instead  of  Jeanette 
sticking  out  a  tongue  of  scorn  or  weeping 
crocodile  tears,  she  did  something  about  it. 
For  one  thing  she  took  a  good  long  look  at  her 
legs  in  the  glass  and  realized  those  kids  spoke 
the  truth.  Her  legs  were  thin  and  shapeless. 
From  this  point  she  went  on.  Exercising  her 
legs.  Piling  up  her  arithmetic  and  speller  on 
the  floor  and  practised  stepping  up  and  down. 
Up  and  down. 

Hour  after  hour  she  kept  after  it  while  the 
neighborhood  kids  played  hopscotch  and  had 
all  kinds  of  fun. 

And  oh,  those  legs  now.

In  the  show,  "Nightboat,"  she  was  actually 
and  truthfully  known  as  the  ugly  duckling. 
Gorgeous,  golden  Jeanette.  And  again  she 
wasted  no  tears  but  did  things  about  it.  She 
learned  to  walk  properly,  to  do  things  with  her 
hands.    She  studied  her  complexion,  her  hair. 

After  her  first  picture,  "The  Love  Parade," 
a  New  York  critic  wrote  he  liked  the  work  of 
this  Miss  MacDonald,  but  her  buck  teeth,  long 
neck  and  jutting  jaw  left  him  cold.  Naturally, 
Jeanette  has  none  of  the  defects,  but  instead  of 
flying  into  a  tantrum  or  simply  saying,  "Why, 
the  man's  crazy,"  and  dismissing  it,  she 
thought  it  over  calmly  and  sanely  and  went 
again  to  see  the  picture  through  his  eye.  And 
saw  exactly  why  he  might  reach  such  comical 
conclusions. 

She  hadn't  used  the  proper  make-up  on  her 
neck  and  she  experimented  and  thought  until 
she  discovered  a  darker  shade  of  powder  on  her 
jaw  made  it  less  full. 

And  again  she  profited  and  learned.  And 
thanks  him  for  it. 

CHE  claims  we  all  look  at  ourselves  with  eyes 
'-'of  love.  Blind  to  our  defects.  That's  why 
Mrs.  Brown  looks  ridiculous  in  that  new  hat 
and  never  suspects.  And  why  we  are  apt  to 
look  just  as  comical  and  imagine  we're  the  last 
word.  View  yourself  critically,  Jeanette  says, 
and  not  through  eyes  of  self-love. 

A  famous  theatrical  producer  once  told 
Jeanette  a  secret  of  success  that  works.  She's 
passing  it  on  to  you. 

"Go  to  your  room  and  shut  the  door,"  he 
told  her.  "Stand  before  the  glass  and  say  very 
earnestly  and  sincerely  to  yourself,  'I  will  be  a 
successful  and  beautiful  woman.  I  will.'  Say 
it  over  and  over  and  watch  the  confidence  and 
poise  and  assurance  that  comes  stealing  over 
you." 

So  while  the  other  girls  rushed  off  to  the  good 
times  Jeanette  MacDonald  sat  by  herself  in  a 
dingy  little  dressing-room  saying  over  and  over 
and  over,  "I  will  be  a  beautiful  and  successful 
woman."    And  worked  for  it. 

And  so  she  is.

The  Shadow  Stage 


[CONTIN1  I. II  FROM  PAGE  59 


KONGO— M-G-M 

AS  lurid  a  tale  of  hatred  and  revenge  as  ever 
Lou  Chanty  played  in,  but  without  his 
genius  to  make  it  come  to  life.  Walter  Huston 
m  a  rdle  unsuited  to  his  personality;  Lupc  Yelcz 
with  little  chance  to  act;  Virginia  Hruce's 
prettiness  sacrificed  to  a  sordid  part.  For  those 

who  like  their  jungle  stories  filled  with  horror, 
here  i>  strong  meat,  hut  children  should  stay 
home  and  study  their  geography. 

SPORT  PARADE— RKO-Radio 

IN  spite  of  fine  action  shots  of  sport  events. 
in  spite  of  Robert  Benchley's  funny  dialogue 
and  good  performance  as  a  sports  broadcaster, 
in  spite  of  Skeets  Gallagher's  amusing  por- 
trayal of  the  cameraman,  this  remains  a  weak 
story.  Joel  McCrea  and  William  Gargan  are 
buddies  on  the  football  held  who  go  their 
separate  ways  after  they  leave  college,  Joel 
having  a  series  of  misadventures  as  a  profes- 
sional player  and  Bill  going  on  and  up  as  a 
sports  writer.  There's  the  basis  of  a  good  plot, 
but  somehow  or  other  it  fails  to  jell.  Marian 
Marsh  is  the  love  interest. 


SHERLOCK  HOLMES— Fox 

"V\  7HAT  would  Sherlock  Holmes  do  if  gang- 
*»  sters  tried  to  "take"  London?  See  this 
and  you'll  know  the  answer.  Give  Brook 
plays  Sherlock,  and  wait  till  you  see  him  made 
up  as  an  old  maid!  Ernest  Torrence  is  the 
sinister  Professor  Moriarly,  and  you'll  like 
Miriam  Jordan,  a  newcomer.  Good  stuff,  full 
of  thrills  and  chuckles. 


HER  MAD  NIGHT— 
Mayfair  Pictures 

A  GAIN  a  mother  makes  the  supreme  sac- 
■**Tifice  for  her  daughter.  Irene  Rich,  as  the 
mother,  shields  her  daughter,  Mary  Carlisle, 
from  the  ugly  stain  of  murder,  but  is  herself 
saved  at  the  last  minute  by  the  daughter's 
confession.  Conway  Tearle  is  splendid  as  the 
district  attorney  and  the  man  who  loves  Irene. 
Kenneth  Thomson  is  a  shrewd  villain,  as 
always. 

THIS  SPORTING  AGE— Columbia 

•"THRILLING  polo  playing  by  Jack  Holt, 
*■  Hardie  Albright  and  Walter  Byron  makes 
this  picture  lively.  Jack  Holt  gives  an  assured 
performance;  Walter  Byron  makes  a  convinc- 
ing villain,  and  Hardie  Albright  and  Evalyn 
Knapp  a  satisfactory  pair  of  young  lovers. 

TOO  BUSY  TO  WORK— Fox 

TT  brings  a  lump  to  the  throat  to  think  of 
-'-Will  Rogers  in  an  insipid  picture  like  this. 
They  tried  to  make  Will  go  dramatic.  And 
who  wants  him  other  than  himself?  You'll 
enjoy  parts  —  Will  couldn't  make  a  picture 
that  is  all  bad. 


WHITE  EAGLE— Columbia 

T5UCK  JONES,  as  White  Eagle,  an  Indian 
■'-'brave,  drives  the  pony  express  for  the  pale- 
faces. War  breaks  out  when  his  redskin 
brothers  are  accused  of  horse-stealing.  Buck 
captures  tlu-  real  thieves  and  rescues  Barbara 
Weeks,  whom  they  had  kidnapped.  There's  a 
surprise  ending.

HIDDEN  GOLD— Universal 

nro.M  MIX  in  another  thriller,  the  high  spot 
-*-  being  a  forest  lire.  Tom  is  falsely  accused 
of  robbery,  but  is  saved  by  little  Judith  Barrie 
with  the  help  of  his  faithful  horse,  Tony.  Nice 
stuff  for  folks  who  like  Westerns  and,  of 
course,  the  kids  will  love  it. 


Stax 

Those  perennial  favorites,  "Our 
Gang"  comedians,  perched  on  the 
ladder  of  fame.  From  top  to  bottom 
they  sit:  Stymie,  Dickie  Moore, 
Dorothy  Echo  De  Borba,  Spanky  and 
Pete  the  Pup.  And  their  latest  is 
Hal  Roach's  "A  Lad  an'  a  Lamp" 


THE  TELEGRAPH  TRAIL— Warners 

•"THE  story  of  how  the  telegraph  was  laid 
-*-  from  East  to  West,  with  plenty  of  hard- 
ships and  Indian  attacks.  John  Wayne  is 
good  as  the  brave  young  soldier  who  tackles 
the  final  stretch.  Frank  McHugh  and  Otis 
Harlan  furnish  the  fun  and  Marceline  Day 
the  romance.  Children  will  love  this  as  it  is 
full  of  action. 

RACKETY  RAX— Fox 

"L-TERE  is  Victor  McLaglen  again  in  the  kind 
■*-  ■'-of  roughneck  comedy  that]  made  him 
famous.  It's  an  utterly  nonsensical  plot,  about 
a  big  shot  racketeer  who  buys  a  college  so  he 
can  have  his  own  football  team  and  cut  in  on 
the  football  racket.  There  are  some  good 
dance  numbers  by  a  chorus  of  cuties  and  some 
sprightly  tunes.  Good  for  a  lot  of  laughs  on  a 
dull  winter's  evening. 


THE  FIGHTING  GENTLEMAN— 
Freuler  Film 

A  FAST  moving  picture  with  some  ex- 
■*  *•  cellent  prize  fight  scenes.  It's  an  old, 
trite  plot,  but  William  Collier,  Jr.,  Josephine 
Dunn,  Natalie  Moorhead,  Pat  O'Malley  and 
Lee  Moran  breathe  a  little  new  life  into  it. 
James  J.  Jeffries,  former  heavyweight  cham- 
pion, appears  as  a  fight  referee. 

THE  FOURTH  HORSEMAN— 
Universal 

•"TOM    MIX'S    best   picture   and   best   per- 
*■  formance    in    a    long    time.      Not    much 
dialogue,  but  truly  thrilling  and  peppy  action. 
Take  the  children,  by  all  means. 

VANITY  STREET— Columbia 

/^HARLES  BICKFORD  in  the  role  of  a 
^-*radio-car  policeman  who,  instead  of  arrest- 
ing her  for  breaking  a  window,  befriends 
hungry  and  desperate  Helen  Chandler.  She 
falls  for  him,  but  he  remains  only  friendly.  So 
she  turns  to  gigolo-villain  George  Meeker  and 
is  arrested  by  Bickford  for  his  murder.  But 
all  ends  well. 

THE  KING  MURDER— Chesterfield 

HPHE  story  keeps  you  on  the  edge  of  the  seat 
•*■  every  moment.  A  Broadway  butterfly  dies 
of  poison  from  a  scratch,  but  how  did  she  get 
the  scratch?  Natalie  Moorhead,  Conway 
Tearle  and  Don  Alvarado  are  excellent  as 
suspects. 

MEN  ARE  SUCH  FOOLS— RKO-Radio 

HERE'S  a  badly  handled  story  that  is 
almost  lifted  from  the  commonplace  by 
fine  acting.  Leo  Carrillo.  Yivienne  Osborne 
and  Una  Merkel  give  excellent  pel  formance  s. 
It's  a  long-winded  tale,  showing  how  suffering 
and  a  prison  sentence  inspire  a  musician  to 
compose  his  masterpiece. 

THE  GOLDEN  WEST— Fox 

AZANE  GREY  Western,  starting  with  a 
Kentucky  feud  killing  which  separates 
two  lovers,  and  winding  up  with  a  massacre 
which  ends  only  when  they  run  out  of  Indians. 
As  the  White  Indian,  George  O'Brien  wears 
next  to  nothing,  and  can  he  wear  it?  Bert 
Hanlon  is  outstanding  in  a  satisfactory  cast.

EXPOSED— Eagle  Prod. 


A  N  honest  police  doctor  turns  dishonest 
■**■  to  trap  a  gang  of  crooks.  His  sweet- 
heart misunderstands,  but  you  know  better. 
Just  another  of  those  stories  that  would  never 
have  been  written  if  just  one  word  had  been 
spoken  in  explanation.  Must  lovers  always 
suffer  so?  Barbara  Kent  and  William  Collier, 
Jr.,  haven't  much  chance  with  the  material 
this  offers. 


TRAILING  THE  KILLER— World  Wide 

A  NUMBER  of  animals,  wild  and  semi- 
■**•  domesticated,  enact  an  interesting  story 
with  little  interference  from  humans.  Caesar, 
an  Australian  trained  shepherd  dog,  is  the 
star.  He  battles  his  master's  enemies,  pro- 
tects his  flock  from  a  mountain  lion  and  almost 
gets  killed  when  suspected  of  treachery.  If 
you  have  a  fondness  for  dogs  you'll  like  this. 


THE  MONKEY'S  PAW—RKO-Radio 

HPHIS  film  has  little  entertainment  value 
*■  although  the  British  cast  is  a  capable  one. 
Wesley  Ruggles'  direction,  too,  is  good  but 
seems  wasted  on  such  a  dull  story.  It's  about 
a  monkey's  paw  and  the  superstition  that  its 
possession  will  bring  tragedy 


THE  COWBOY  COUNSELLOR— 
First  Division-Allied 

"D  ACK  to  the  good  old  days  of  sheriffs  with 
-'-'big,  black  moustaches.  Hoot  Gibson  is  a 
typical  book  salesman  of  the  nineties.  He's  a 
doctor  when  he's  peddling  medical  books  and 
a  lawyer  when  he  has  legal  ones.  A  beautiful 
girl  begs  him  to  defend  her.  What  could  he 
do?  Sheila  Mannors'  work  is  so  good  you 
wonder  why  you  don't  see  her  in  bigger 
pictures. 

THE  PRIDE  OF  THE  LEGION— 
Mascot  Pictures 

T  7ICTOR  JORY  wins  individual  honors  by 
»  his  realistic  interpretation  of  a  cop  turned 
yellow.  Rin-Tin-Tin,  Jr.,  saves  him  from 
suicide.  Too  much  dialogue  and  too  little 
action  slow  up  what  might  have  been  a  good 
picture. 

RENEGADES  OF  THE  WEST— 
RKO-Radio 

HpOM  KEENE  serves  a  term  in  the  pen- 
*■  itentiary  to  discover  who  killed  his  father, 
joins  a  gang  of  cattle  rustlers,  judges  a  baby 
contest,  out-rides,  out-shoots,  out-wrestles  and 
out-fights  everybody  else  to  bring  the  culprits 
to  justice  and  win  the  girl.  Betty  Furness  is 
the  love  interest  and  Rosco  Ates  does  the 
clowning. 


THE  CRUSADER— Majestic  Pictures 

A  DISTRICT  attorney  (H.  B.  Warner) 
•*■■  is  trying  to  wipe  out  crime,  and  a  re- 
porter (Ned  Sparks)  is  out  to  dig  up  scandal. 
Sparks  digs  up  a  story  that  involves  the 
district  attorney's  wife,  sister,  a  blackmailer 
and  a  reformed  racketeer.  Lew  Cody  is  the 
racketeer,  and  Evelyn  Brent,  as  the  attorney's 
wife,  looks  stunning. 


THE  BALL  (Le  Bal)— 
Vandal-Delac  Prod.

Joan  Turns  to  Laughter 


;  (  0NTIN1  ED  PKOM  PACE  72  J 


an  astonished  and  dignified  Englishman  across 

ir,  knocking  his  hat  into  a  lathered  face 

.u  ru-s    the    room.      For   all    the    world    like   a 

Sennett  comedy.     The  place  was  in  an  uproar. 

And  Jo:in  Crawford  sat  down  on  the  steps  of 
a  London  barber  shop  and  laughed.  Really 
and  honestly  laughed.  For  the  first  time  in 
months.  And  with  the  flood  gates  broken,  it 
needed  only  I'aree,  the  frivolous  witch,  to  com- 
plete the  miracle  of  Joan  Crawford. 

Now  mind,  there  was  plenty  of  reason  for 
the  sad,  haunted-faced  Joan  that  Hollywood 
knew.  Plenty  of  reason  to  be  blue.  For.  with- 
out doubt,  she  was  one  of  the  most  maligned, 
most  gossiped  about  young  women  in  pictures. 
And  Joan  knew  it.  Her  rapid  and  sure  success 
put  her  right  out  in  the  open.  A  target  for 
those  who  hadn't  reached  that  coveted  top. 
Her  every  move  was  watched  with  the  same 
intensity  that  a  snake  gives  a  charmed  bird. 

"There's  a  young  man  in  my  next  picture 
that's  going  to  be  a  knockout."  she  said  some 
time  ago.  '"You  mark  my  words  the  boy  has 
everything.  His  name  is  Clark  Gable,  and  he's 
headed  for  the  top." 

A XI)  that  was  enough.  Instantly,  the 
tongues  wagged.  "What  star  is  interested 
in  her  leading  man?"  a  local  scandal  sheet  de- 
manded. And  even  if  it  had  been  true  (which, 
of  course,  it  wasn't),  the  amount  of  injury 
done  Joan  Crawford  was  all  out  of  proportion 
to  the  offense. 

And  there  was  that  incident  that  happened 


in  a  Hollywood  restaurant.  Joan  and  a  woman 
unknown  to  a  certain  writer,  sat  at  a  table  in 
the  corner.  The  writer  barged  over.  "Oh, 
Joan,"  she  gushed,  "I  just  saw  your  picture 
'  Possessed,'  last  night  and  you  were  wonderful. 
you  were  inspired  by  someone,  I  know.  You 
can'l  tell  me  after  those  love  scenes  with  (.'lark 
Gable  that  you  aren't  crazy  about  him.  The 
way  you  looked  at  him — "  and  on  and  on  it 
went. 

Joan  sat  very  still  and  quiet  through  it  all. 
She  waited  until  the  writer  was  through.  And 
then  turning  to  her  said  in  that  quiet,  cultured 
voice  of  hers,"  May  I  present  my  good  friend, 
.Mrs.  Clark  Gable?"'  And  the  ensuing  stillness 
could  have  been  cut  with  a  knife. 

A  certain  director,  with  a  rush  of  importance 
to  the  head,  gave  out  bits  of  information  that 
eventually  found  their  way  into  print.  In  the 
story  Joan  was  made  to  look  pretty  much  the 
cheap,  the  envious  and  the  obvious  type  of 
person. 

Doug  was  late  coming  home  to  dinner  the 
night  that  story  appeared.  "Where's  Miss 
Crawford?"  he  asked  a  servant.  "Upstairs," 
he  answered.  "  She  came  in  some  time  ago, 
but  she  must  be  sleeping.  I  haven't  heard  her 
moving  about." 

Doug  climbed  the  stairs  quietly.  Gently  he 
pushed  open  the  door.  And  there  she  lay.  On 
the  floor  under  the  dressing  table.  Sound 
asleep.  The  magazine,  a  crumpled  mass,  was 
still  clenched  in  her  hand.  She  hadn't  suc- 
cumbed without  a  lonely  but  well-fought  bat- 


tle, it  seemed.  Her  cheeks  stained  with  dried 
tears.  The  famous,  the  glamorous,  the  alluring 
Joan  Crawford.  Laid  low  by  Hollywood. 
Once  again. 

SHE'S  like  a  child  in  lots  of  ways,  this  Craw- 
ford woman.  Her  eyes  are  fixed  on  the 
brightest  bauble  of  fame  high  up  on  the  tree. 
The  brightest,  highest,  gayest  bauble  on  the 
tree.    She  wants  it  for  her  own. 

She'll  get  it. 

Not  satisfied,  she's  built  herself  over,  and 
completely,  too — torn  down  the  old  walls  and 
knocked  out  the  thin  partitions. 

She  has  erected,  brick  by  brick,  a  solid  and 
substantial  building.  Hours  of  singing,  of 
study,  of  dancing,  are  going  into  the  decoration 
of  that  building. 

She's  even  regained  her  sense  of  humor,  her 
good  cheer,  the  one  last  thing  she  needed  to 
make  that  building  secure.  Now,  at  last,  with 
that  regained  sense  of  humor  she  can  safely 
look  out  of  that  upstairs  window  and  laugh, 
even  at  herself.  For  she  does  the  oddest  things 
and  thinks  the  oddest  things.  Only  now  she 
knows  they're  funny. 

Moreover,  she  can  look  down  at  that  group 
of  people  busily  engaged  with  the  slinging  of 
mud-balls  at  a  solid  brick  wall  and  laugh,  for 
at  last  she  knows  it's  funny. 

And  there'll  be  no  more  weeps,  no  more 
gloom,  no  more  taking  of  life  so  seriously,  for 
Joan. 

Not  for  a  long,  long  time,  anyway.

Bolshevistic  statements.  Nor  to  be  late  on  sets 
and  keep  high-priced  companies  waiting.  Nor 
to  "go  up"  on  his  lines  and  make  numerous  re- 
takes necessary.  Jimmy  can  learn  lines.  He's 
as  bright  as  the  proverbial  dollar.  But  perhaps 
he  didn't  study  when  he  wasn't  feeling  chummy 
with  the  big  fellows. 

In  other  words,  Jimmy  is  to  sprout  wings  and 
then  sec  to  it  that  they  are  kept  well  preened. 

He's  doing  a  splendid  job  of  the  sprouting. 
He's  keeping  mum  and  keeping  his  arms  limber 
with  well-timed  back  slapping. 

JIMMY'S  not  the  first  little  lad  to  turn  good 
because  the  Hollywood  papas  promised  him 
an  extra  bite  of  plum  pudding.  Nor  is  he  the 
first  to  kick  and  scream  and  run  home  to 
mother  because  he  decided  he  wasn't  being  well 
treated. 

The  money  disease  is  one  of  the  most  con- 
tagious in  Hollywood. 

Remember  Yalentino?  He  was  the  first  to 
say  "I  won't  play."  Lew  Ayres?  Recall  how 
long  he  stayed  away  from  Universal?  Clark 
Gable?  Clark's  gone  home  twice  and  waited 
until  new  contracts  were  written.  Greta 
Garbo?  The  silent  Swede  stayed  home  seven 
months.    Remember? 

There  have  been  others.  Many  others. 
They  come  to  Hollywood  happy  to  get  seventy- 
five  dollars  a  week.    Like  Jimmy  Cagney. 

Jimmy  was  an  instantaneous  success.  He 
could  not  foresee  that  he  would  be.  when  he 
signed  his  original  contract.  Neither  could 
Warners.  He  was  just  one  more  experiment  to 
be  tried  upon  the  ever-yearning-for-new-heroes 
public. 

Two  hundred  a  week  seemed  like  stupendous 
money  to  Jimmy  from  New  York.  It  was  a  fair 
gamble  for  Warner  Brothers.

Of  the  thousands  of  unknowns  upon  whom 
producers  have  gambled,  Jimmy  was  one  who 
clicked.  The  producers  would  make  up  what 
they  had  lost  upon  the  other  999  from  this  one 
sensation.  Common  sense — from  their  stand- 
point. 

Only  Jimmy  didn't  care  what  they  had  lost 
upon  others.  Jimmy  had  not  been  away  long 
enough  from  those  lean,  lanky  days  of  happen- 
chance  bits  as  a  "hoofer"  to  forget  that  a  guy's 
got  to  protect  himself  and  let  the  devil  care  for 
the  hindmost. 

Besides,  Hollywood's  first  disease  had  bitten 
into  his  system.  He  was  playing  on  a  lot  where 
he  learned  that  Corinne  Griffith  had  once  made 
ten  thousand  dollars  a  week  and  Colleen  Moore 
twelve  thousand;  where  Dick  Barthelmess  was 
still  making  one  hundred  twenty-five  thousand 
dollars  per  picture  and  Ruth  Chatterton  about 
seventy-five  hundred  weekly. 

A  ND  "The  Public  Enemy."  Jimmy's  pic- 
■*»-ture,  had  topped  them  all.  His  fan  mail  was 
already  larger.  Interviewers  crowded  around 
his  door  like  flies  around  an  open  milk  bottle. 
Why  shouldn't  he  cash  in?  He  could  clean  up  a 
fortune  in  a  couple  of  years  and  retire  to  study 
medicine — a  profession  for  which  he  had  always 
secretly  hankered. 

He  was  polite  in  his  first  request.  They  were 
polite  in  their  answer.  Of  course,  they  must 
have  smiled. 

"  My  dear  boy.  you  may  be  a  flash  in  the 
pan  for  all  we  know.  How  can  we  tell?  In  a 
few  months,  the  public  may  have  forgotten  you 
as  they  have  others.  What  if  we  should  give 
you  a  poor  story?  Where  would  you  be  then? 
Besides,  think  of  the  money  we  have  spent  on 
you.  We  have  given  you  these  fine  stories, 
have    we    not?      We    advertised    vour    name 


throughout  the  world.    Who  ever  heard  of  you 
until  we  furnished  the  opportunity?  " 

These  may  not  have  been  the  exact  words, 
but  they  represent,  at  least,  the  context.  Pro- 
ducers have  been  using  the  same  arguments 
since  Yalentino  first  threatened  to  run  home  to 
mother. 

JUSTIFIABLE  words.  There  is  no  use  argu- 
ing against  them.  Any  fair-minded  person 
can  see  the  common  sense  in  these  oft-repeated 
statements.  More  especially  can  we  view  them 
with  fairness  when  they  are  made  under 
present  economic  conditions. 

But  artists  are  not  expected  to  see  two  sides 
to  a  question.  They  would  not  be  artists  if  they 
were  mathematicians. 

Jimmy  went  home  and  stayed  there,  even  as 
Garbo  had  done  four  years  previously.  Only 
Jimmy  was  more  dangerous  than  Garbo.  He 
could  speak  English  and  express  his  opinions  to 
the  eager  press.  Garbo  knew  no  English.  She 
could  only  remain  silent. 

Yet,  he  was  not  truly  threatening  in  the 
beginning.  Warners  knew  perfectly  well  that 
Jimmy  couldn't  work  for  any  other  company — 
not  even  for  Mary  Pickford  who  wanted  him 
for  "Shanty  Town"  —  until  they  released 
him.  They  had  a  contract  for  his  exclusive 
services  and.  besides,  producers  have  a  nice, 
friendly,  gentlemanly  agreement  that  a  child 
who  is  naughty  at  one  studio  will  not  be  hired 
by  another.  Not  until  the  contract  has  ex- 
pired. 

Jimmy  threatened  to  produce  his  own 
pictures.  Even  that  didn't  stir  up  any  excite- 
ment. No  company  would  release  any  picture 
made  by  run-away  Jimmy. 

Then  Jimmy  took  another  tack.  He  threat- 
ened suit.

But  while  Irish  blood  heats  rapidly,  it  also 
cools  eventually. 

Perhaps  Jimmy  began  to  look  over  the 
situation  with  a  more  discriminating  eye.  Per- 
haps he  realized  that  he  was  not,  after  all,  a 
crusader  for  right,  but  just  one  of  many 
renegades.  There  had  been  Charles  Bickford. 
Charlie  had  talked  big,  too.  He  had  called 
producers  everything  that  Jimmy  had  called 
them. 

But  now,  Charlie  was  being  a  very  good  little 
boy.  He  was  taking  the  pictures  offered,  stuff- 
ing the  money  in  his  sock  and  chirping  about 
the  perfect  gentlemen  who  run  motion  pictures. 

And  Clark  Gable  was  doing  what  he  was 
ordered  to.  Perhaps  Jimmy  wondered  if  there 
were  any  connection  between  Clark's  last 
demand  for  a  salary  increase  and  several  very, 
very  bad  roles  which  followed  and  which  hurt 
his  popularity  materially. 

As  for  producing  his  own  pictures.  Someone 
probably  reminded  him  of  the  well-known 
story  of  Gloria  Swanson.  What  a  fool  she  had 
been  to  turn  down  twenty-two  thousand  dollars 
a  week  on  salary  to  make  her  own  picture.  All 
that  worry  and  responsibility! 

As  for  that  court  battle — Jimmy  couldn't 
foretell  the  outcome.  He  might  spend  his 
whole  stake  on  lawyers  and  court  costs  and 
then  find  himself  with  nothing  left  but  his 
pride. 

Pride!  You  can't  live  on  that.  None  knew 
that  better  than  Jimmy. 

Besides,  Jimmy  Cagney  is  a  regular  fellow. 
When  he  cools  off  from  his  Irish  explosions,  he's 
the  gentlest  kind  of  person. 

So  perhaps  Jimmy's  really  more  contrite  now 
than  we  are  prone  to  credit.  Although  we 
imagine  it's  easier  for  a  natural  Irish  rebel  like 
Jimmy  to  be  contrite  when  the  difference  be- 
tween seventeen  hundred  fifty  dollars  and 
thirty-five  hundred  a  week  for  six  months  is 
something  like  forty-five  thousand  dollars.

Peggy  from  Pine  Bluff 


CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  69  j 


small  town  girl  a  chance  to  join  the  famous 
Ziegfeld  Follies. 

She  was  visiting  New  York  with  her  mother 
and  little  sister,  and  a  friend,  who  wanted  the 
fun  of  seeing  those  big  eyes  grow  even  rounder 
with  excitement,  took  her  backstage  at  the 
Follies  one  day.  An  alert  press-agent,  noting 
the  slim  little  red-head  in  checked  gingham 
and  long  curls,  had  her  picture  taken  with  the 
late  Florenz  Ziegfeld  and,  as  a  publicity  stunt, 
announced  that  she  was  the  newest  recruit 
to  the  Follies,  chosen  right  before  the  beautiful 
painted  faces  of  more  sophisticated  applicants. 

NO  one  knows  why  the  matter  didn't  end 
there,  but  Peggy  found  herself  in  the  Fol- 
lies chorus.  She  learned  to  dance  after  she 
joined.  A  little  later,  a  seasoned  veteran  of 
seventeen,  she  danced  in  Earl  Carroll's  Van- 
ities. Then  she  advanced  to  ingenue  leads 
and  appeared  in  about  fifteen  stage  plays, 
one  right  after  the  other,  all  of  which  barely 
survived  the  opening  night.  Undaunted,  she 
posed  for  photographers  and  appeared  in 
Texas  Guinan  floor  shows. 

At  twenty-four,  she  has  been  Mrs.  Alan 
Davis  for  six  years.  Alan  is  a  stage  actor  and 
because  of  their  respective  jobs  there  have  had 
to  be  frequent  separations.  Reporters  have 
spread  the  usual  divorce  rumors,  and  Peggy 
and  Alan  read  the  stories  of  their  contemplated 


divorce  and  laugh  over  them  together.  But 
they're  sorry  such  stories  are  printed. 

She  wishes  she  could  be  a  little  more 
swanky.  "But  how  can  I  be?"  she  asks.  "I 
haven't  any  chauffeur.  I  drive  my  own  car — 
it  will  be  my  own  when  I  make  the  last  pay- 
ment. I  don't  need  a  lot  of  maids  and  service. 
I  like  to  cook  some  of  the  meals  for  Alan  and 
me,  when  we're  alone  and  I  have  the  time. 
Swank?  How  does  one  learn  to  put  it  on  and 
get  used  to  it?" 

When  she  first  appeared  at  the  Paramount 
studio  she  didn't  even  own  a  make-up  box. 
Her  stage  make-up,  which  was  all  wrong  for 
pictures,  was  neatly  packed  in  one  of  those 
round  tins  in  which  reels  of  film  are  stored. 

She  was  so  thrilled  the  first  time  she  saw 
her  name  in  lights  outside  a  movie  theater 
that  she  stepped  back  into  the  street  for  a 
better  perspective  and  was  very  nearly  run 
down  by  a  street  car.  She  keeps  out  of  car 
tracks  now,  but  still  thrills  to  her  name  in 
lights.  And  to  the  whispered  "There's  Peggy 
Shannon"  comments  when  people  recognize 
her. 

Eats  anything  she  wants  when  she  isn't 
working,  but  is  more  careful  when  she  is.  Her 
working  routine  is  an  all-fruit  breakfast,  lunch 
of  salad  or  some  plain  sandwich  and  coffee, 
.dinner  about  the  same  except  the  nights  she 
works  late.      Takes  no  chances  then,  but  eats 


a  hearty  meal  to  keep  up  her  energy.  She 
weighs  one  hundred  ten  pounds  and  is  five 
feet,  four  and  one-half  inches  tall. 

She  drinks  Coca-Cola  by  the  gallon,  and  ought 
to  compete  with  Tallulah  Bankhead  for  the 
Coca-Cola  Consuming  Championship  of  Cal- 
ifornia.   Probably  both  would  win. 

Her  unbobbed  hair  is  so  red  it  sends  out  a 
glow,  and  her  mind  is  as  bright  as  her  hair. 
Nice  combination,  that.  The  kind  that  should 
take  a  girl  far. 

Her  eyes  change  from  hazel  to  green  and 
back  to  hazel  again,  and  her  nose  is  just 
enough  retrousse  to  be  cute. 

T  OWELL  SHERMAN  is  one  of  her  favorite 
-"actors.  Her  part  opposite  him  in  World 
Wide's  picture,  "False  Faces,"  is  compara- 
tively small,  but  she  would  have  done  a  mere 
walk-on  for  a  chance  in  a  Sherman  picture. 
She  thinks  Madge  Evans  is  a  grand  actress. 
They've  been  friends  since  ten-year-old 
Madge  met  little  Winona  Sammon  down  in 
Arkansas,  where  Madge,  then  a  child  star,  was 
making  personal  appearances  in  the  interests 
of  the  Madge  Evans  hats. 

Peggy's  thirteen-year-old  sister,  Carolyn,  is 
often  asked,  "Aren't  you  Sylvia  Sidney's 
little  sister?"  Carolyn  has  dark  brown  hair 
like  Sylvia's,  plans  to  be  a  writer,  and  is  proud 
of  being  Peggy  Shannon's  little  sister.

Alice,  Please  Come  Home'!

and  eyes  on  his  ragged  cuff  and  waving  a  grimy 
little  hand  as  long  as  he  could  see  her  face. 

They  correspond,  Alice  and  Mickey,  reg- 
ularly. 

TN  Alice  White  most  people  recognize  some- 
-*-thing  they  can  understand.  A  girl  like  them- 
selves who  started  from  scratch.  And  never 
quite  erased  the  scratch.  She  did  the  things 
they  would  have  done,  said  the  things  they 
would  have  said,  made  the  same  mistakes  they 
made,  and  thus  this  tremendous  bridge  of 
understanding  that  spans  the  gulf  between 
Alice,  the  movie  star,  and  her  followers. 

A  bridge  that  some  stars  can  never  build. 

Her  advance  agent  would  approach  the 
manager  of  a  theater  in  a  certain  city.  "What," 
they'd  say,  "book  Alice  White?  Naw,  she's 
all  washed  up.  The  people  won't  go  for  these 
has-been  movie  stars,  anymore."  But  when 
Alice  did  play  that  city,  did  their  eyes  do 
some  bulging?  The  only  other  line  in  town 
was  the  breadline  and  there  hadn't  been  a 
line  like  that  before  his  theater  for  years. 

And  so  the  nine  long  months  of  touring 
brought  out  at  least  two  million  people  to  see 
Alice  White,  and  the  printed  accounts  were 
viewed  with  alarm  in  Hollywood.  And  Holly- 
wood could  stand  it  no  longer.  So  they  said 
in  effect,  "Alice,  please  come  home.  We  need 
you!" 

And  wasn't  that  a  personal  triumph  for  the 
little  girl;  for  Hollywood  is  usually  too  proud 
to  admit  it's  wrong — even  when  it  is.  So  she 
listened  to  their  pleas  and  returned.  A  new 
Alice.  The  sunken  cheeks,  the  tired  eyes,  the 
emaciated  little  form,  the  unsure  manner — 
gone. 

Her  cheeks  were  round  and  lovely.  Her 
eyes  bigger  and  brighter.  Her  little  form 
rounded  out.  There  was  more  assurance  about 
Alice.    She  had  been  places  and  learned  things. 


But  Alice  doesn't  confess  (the  imp)  that  with 
all  this  rested  look,  this  new  assurance,  she 
has  gotten  herself  a  new  nose.  A  removed 
cartilage  has  certainly  done  things  for  Alice. 

Today  she's  right  back  in  the  same  studio 
she  left  so  suddenly  two  years  ago.  Warners 
heard  the  clamoring  of  the  fans,  saw  those 
thousands  of  letters  and  dozens  of  packed 
theaters  and,  being  wise,  cried,  "Welcome 
home,  Alice. " 

So  Alice  is  making  "Employees'  Entrance" 
at  Warners. 

The  trouble  between  Alice  White  and  Holly- 
wood was  simply  this:  Hollywood  resented 
the  White  kid. 

HPHEY  resented  her  easy  step  into  the  bright 
■*■  spotlight  and  big  money.  Too  many  actors 
and  actresses  had  worked  long,  hard  years  for 
that  coveted  spot.  Had  suffered  hardships 
and  trials.  Had  studied  and  worked  and  with- 
stood disappointments.  And  only  after  the 
hardest  years  of  trouping,  had  made  it. 

And  here  was  this  flip  little  kid,  just  a 
sassy,  untrained  script  girl,  stepping  into  the 
place  they  had  been  struggling  toward  for 
years. 

It  rankled. 

But  if  Alice  had  used  tact  and  gone  humbly, 
quietly  and  gratefully  about  her  work,  all 
might  have  been  eventually  forgotten  and  for- 
given. 

But,  no  sir!  You  weren't  going  to  soft- 
pedal  Alice.  Alice  was  as  good  as  anyone. 
This  with  a  loud,  irritating  snap  of  the  fingers. 

On  the  First  Xational  lot  at  the  time  (this 
was  five  years  ago)  were  Billie  Dove,  the  ultra 
and  ladylike  Corinne  Griffith  and  the  star  of 
stars,  Colleen  Moore.  And  into  their  refined 
midst  stepped  Alice.  Which  was  just  the 
same  as  putting  a  lighted  firecracker  under  the 
bishop's  chair. 


Within  Alice  burned  a  flaming  desire  to 
succeed. 

The  whole  catastrophe  of  this  misguided 
kid,  if  viewed  from  the  stage  by  an  audience, 
would  have  honestly  brought  a  lump  to  the 
throat  and  tears  to  the  eyes.  She  was  so 
wrong  in  her  reasoning.  But  Hollywood  was 
too  close  to  the  thing  to  see  it  with  anything 
but  a  disapproving  eye. 

She  never  hesitated  to  do  anything  the  studio 
asked  her  to  do.  The  world's  worst  publicity 
fell  to  Alice.  The  kind  that  had  to  be  done 
and  no  one  else  would  do.  She  offered  sug- 
gestions and  planned  things  herself  that  were 
often  very  good. 

A  ND  then  she  met  Sid  Bartlett.  The  one 
-'^-person  that  really  took  the  time  and  in- 
terest to  do  things  for  Alice.  She  absorbed  and 
learned  and  quieted  down  considerably. 

And  then  Alice  made  the  worst  blunder 
she'd  made  to  date.  She  went  elegant.  Oh, 
so  elegant.  With  lavish  apartment  and  chauf- 
feured  limousines.  Deahme!  She  grew  stand- 
offish with  the  studio  and  it  was  all  pretty 
awful.  The  little  script  girl  had  gone  hoity- 
toity.     Hollywood  snickered. 

And  so  it  went.  Hollywood  as  blind  in  its 
views  as  Alice  was  in  hers. 

But  the  movie  patrons  loved  her.  She  was 
real,  genuine  and  just  herself.  And  they  knew 
it. 

And  there  was  plenty  about  this  Alice  White 
to  love  and  admire,  too.    Don't  forget  that. 

For  instance,  there  was  that  certain  star, 
a  big  name  then,  who  lost  out  on  the  screen. 
It  was  .Mice  who  came  along  and  helped  her 
out.  Quietly,  this  time,  with  no  crashing  of 
cymbals.  Another  little  blonde  favorite  fell 
from  favor  and  again  Alice  was  the  only 
person  who  came  forward  with  a  helping  hand. 
With  no  noise  or  publicity.

see  their  favorite  in  the  same  old  story.  But 
they  still  loved  Alice. 

So  along  came  option  time  and  Alice's  option 
wasn't  taken  up.  She  was  out.  For  six 
months  she  bravely  faced  Hollywood  without 
doing  a  day's  work.  Still  in  her  chauffeured 
limousine  she  went  about,  her  funds  dwindling. 
Without  a  whimper  or  a  word  of  complaint. 
The  little  blonde  head  was  never  once  lowered. 

And  then  came  that  amazing  tour  with 
those  amazing  results. 

So  now  we  wonder. 

Alice  has  had  some  pretty  hard  knocks  in 
the  last  five  years.  She's  acquired  some  of 
that  trouping  other  stars  talked  about  so 
much  without  Alice  understanding.  But  now 
she  does  understand.  She's  learned  about 
movie  stars  from  stage-hands  all  over  the 
states.  How  they  did  this  and  were  criticized. 
And  Alice  has  learned  and  trouped  and  be- 
come quieter.  So  now  we'll  see  what  Holly- 
wood has  to  say  about  Alice  this  time. 

"You  see,"  she  said  in  talking  about  the 
city  of  Washington,  "the  taxis  have  no  glass 
partitions  between  you  and  the  driver  so  the 
conversations  can  go  on."  It  had  never 
occurred  to  her  thatperhapsconversationswith 
taxi  drivers  did  not  always  go  on. 

And  there,  right  there,  is  the  secret  of  this 
hold  Alice  White  maintains  on  her  admirers. 

There  is  no  glass  partition  between  them 
and  Alice.

Kill  a  COLD  before 
It  Takes  Root! 

Get  at  It  Quick  and  Get  at  It  from  the  Inside! 

TREAT  a  cold  quickly  and  treat  it  decisively!  Don't  fool  yourself  with 
half-way  measures.  Half-way  measures  lead  only  to  half-cured  colds. 
A  cold  calls  for  a  COLD  remedy.  Don't  depend  on  preparations  good  for 
half  a  dozen  things  besides  colds.  Many  popular  remedies  actually  make 
a  cold  worse  because  they  are  constipating  and  also  make  the  system  acid. 
Don't  depend,  either,  on  mere  surface  treatments.  A  cold  is  an  internal 

infection  and  calls  for  internal  treatment. 


The  Four  Things  Necessary! 

Grove's  Laxative  Bromo  Quinine  kills  a 
cold  and  kills  it  quick  because  it  is  dis- 
tinctly a  cold  remedy  and  does  the  four 
things  necessary  to  relieve  a  cold. 

First,  it  opens  the  bowels.  Second,  it 
kills  the  cold  germs  in  the  system  and 
reduces  the  fever.  Third,  it  relieves  the 
headache  and  that  grippy  feeling.  Fourth, 
it  tones  the  entire  system  and  fortifies 
against  further  attack. 

Grove's  Laxative  Bromo  Quinine  is  safe 
to  take!  It  contains  no  narcotics  and  pro- 
duces no  bad  after-effects.  Taken  promptly, 
it  will  usually  expel  a  cold  overnight.  So 
in  its  use  lies  safety.  Every  drug  store  in 
America  sells  Grove's  Laxative  Bromo 
Quinine.  Convenient,  pocket-size  box, 
cellophane-wrapped.  Get  it  today!

dresses  in  neat  little  frocks  which  remind  you 
of  mother's  girlhood  staiched  ginghams. 

And  the  finished  actress  you  have  seen  in 
"The  Man  Who  Played  God,"  "The  Rich 
Are  Always  with  Us,"  "So  Big,"  "The  Dark 
Horse,"  "Cabin  in  the  Cotton,"  "Three  on  a 
Match"  and  who  will  be  the  lead  opposite- 
Douglas  Fairbanks,  Jr.,  in  "Parachute 
Jumper"  is  as  simple  as  that. 

"Perhaps  I  should  wear  ermines,"  she  says. 
"That's  what  they  expected  when  they  met  the 
train.  Put  I  am  not  a  politician.  I  can't  be 
anything  but  what  I  am.  I  hope  I  can  act 
for  the  screen,  but  I  know  I  can't  act  as  a 
person. " 

IF  I  were  asked  to  describe  Bette  in  two 
words,  I'd  say  "common  sense."  Perhaps 
that  is  because  "common  sense"  is  the  thing 
to  which  she  clings  in  making  her  decisions. 

She  never  tested  that  out  as  thoroughly  as 
when  she  was  making  up  her  mind,  recently, 
whether  to  marry  or  not  to  marry.  There  was 
so  much  to  be  said  on  both  sides! 

Love  stood  on  the  credit  side  in  huge,  un- 
deniable letters.  Bette  and  Harmon  O.  Nelson, 
Jr.,  had  graduated  from  Cushing  Academy 
(prep  school)  together.  They  had  been  in  love 
then.  Mr.  Nelson  finished  at  Amherst  College 
this  past  June. 

He  came  to  Hollywood  to  see  her  the  past 
summer.  And  three  days  after  his  arrival, 
First  National  sent  her  East  on  personal  ap- 
pearances. 

True  love  has  rough  riding,  you  know.  He 
waited  in  California  for  her. 

But  he  had  no  job!    He  has  musical  talent 


and  hopes  to  become  an  orchestra  leader.  Hut 
hopes  are  not  cure-alls  for  financial  evils. 

He  didn't  wish  to  become  known  as  Mr. 
Bette  Davis.     Still  doesn't! 

Bette  didn't  want  him  to  suffer  what  so 
many  celebrity-husbands  suffer.  She'd  seen 
too  much  of  it. 

"We'd  better  wait — "  It  was  a  mutual 
decision. 

But  they  had  already  waited  six  years. 
Love  becomes  more  and  more  impatient.  As 
Bette  progressed,  would  they  grow  apart? 
Should  they  snatch  at  the  happiness  which 
seemed  to  be  in  their  grasp? 

If  they  didn't,  would  they  go  down  the  years 
— regretting? 

Bette  was  so  afraid  of  marriage,  so 
reasonably,  logically  frightened.  Her  mother 
and  father  had  been  divorced  when  she  was  a 
youngster.  That  was  a  frightful  experience 
for  Bette. 

When  she  graduated  from  prep  school,  her 
father  had  wanted  her  to  take  a  stenographic 
course  so  she  could  immediately  begin  making 
money. 

But  her  mother  had  fought  for  Bette's  right 
to  fulfill  a  childhood  dream,  the  dream  of 
becoming  an  actress. 

Her  mother  did  more  than  fight.  She  worked 
in  a  photographer's  shop  until  she  had  enough 
money  to  take  her  girl  to  New  York  City, 
walk  into  John  Murray  Anderson's  school 
and  say: 

"Here  is  my  daughter.  Will  you  take  her 
and  train  her?" 

It  was  Bette's  mother  who  had  faith  when 
Bette    was    cast    as    atmosphere    in    George 


Cukor's  company  of  "Broadway."  She  said, 
"You  wait,  Bette.  I  just  know  someone  is 
going  to  sprain  an  ankle.  If  you  learn  all  the 
parts — " 

Bette  learned  those  many  roles  to  please 
her  mother.  And  on  the  first  Wednesday 
matinee,  the  ingenue  sprained  her  ankle.  Bette 
replaced  her. 

It  was  Bette's  mother  who  secured  Bette 
more  than  one  position. 

The  child  was  ushering  in  the  theater  of  The 
Provincetown  Players.  Laura  Hope  Crews 
seeing  her,  said: 

"If  you  can  sing  'I  Pass  by  Your  Window' 
by  tomorrow  I'll  have  a  part  for  you." 

Bette's  mother  went  to  the  tiny  music  store. 
They  did  not  have  that  song.  She  stopped 
the  first  man  she  met  on  the  street.  "Can  you 
tell  me  who  is  the  church  organist  in  this 
town?" 

"Why,  I  am,  madam." 

Bette  learned  the  needed  piece  from  the 
organist  and  secured  the  part. 

TF  marriage  could  make  a  lovely  woman  like 
-*-her  mother  unhappy,  well — But  Bette  was 
lonesome. 

"Hollywood  is  the  most  lonesome  town  in 
the  world.  I  suppose  that  is  natural  where 
people  make  so  much  money.  I  felt  I  couldn't 
stand  another  year  here  alone.  Mother  was 
going  East  on  Friday. " 

It  was  at  the  dinner  table  on  a  Wednesday 
night. 

Bette's  mother  and  aunt  had  to  leave  for 
Boston  on  Friday.  Harmon  said,  "It  isn't  fair 
to  judge  marriage  by  one  experience. 


"Keep  it  simple,"  says  the  stencil  on  the  camera,  but  can  you  blame  Ronald  Colman  and  Phyllis  Barry  if 
they  aren't  able  to?  For  shame,  all  you  Peeping  Toms!  Weren't  you  young  yourselves,  once?  We'll  say, 
though,  under  the  circumstances  Ronnie's  carrying  on  manfully  in  this  scene  from  "I  Have  Been  Faithful" 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  December,  1932 


I  I  I 


My  parents  have  been  as  happy  as  yours  have 
been  unhappy." 

And  suddenly,  Bette's  common  sense  began 
working.  "I  suppose  there's  something  difficult 
about  every  marriage.  If  it  weren't  fear  and 
being  a  picture  actress,  it  would  be  something 
else.     Marriage  is  to  overcome  difficulties — " 

Bette's  mother  nodded. 

At  one-thirty,  they  piled  into  Bette's  car. 
Mother,  Bette's  aunt,  Harmon  and  Bette. 
The  three-day  California  license  law  would  not 
allow  them  to  be  married  before  mother  left. 
They  must  go  out  of  the  state.  They  started 
for  Yuma,  Arizona.  They  thought  it  was  about 
fifty  miles. 

They  were  on  the  edge  of  the  desert  before 
they  learned  it  was  three  hundred. 

HpHEY  were  married  at  three-thirty  in  the 
-*-  afternoon  by  a  minister  from  the  Indian 
reservation — when  it  was  so  hot  that  even  the 
Indians  were  having  their  siestas. 

Bette  had  dreamed  since  childhood  of  a 
wedding  veil,  bridesmaids,  the  fragrance  of 
roses. 

She  had  pictured  romance  amidst  soft 
greenery  rather  than  torture  on  a  desert. 
But  marriage  doesn't  really  depend  upon 
wedding  bells  and  fragrance  and  honey- 
moons—  her  common  sense  told  her.  And 
the  outcome  of  that  marriage  has  proved  that 
Bette  was  right! 

"I  have  discovered  I  didn't  want  a  husband 
who  earns  a  livelihood  by  peddling  his  kisses 
for  the  amusement  of  the  public,"  she  says. 
"Hollywood  men  too  often  forget  that  screen 
love-making  is  just  a  part  of  the  script. " 
And  maybe  Bette  is  right  again!

V\TILLIAM  GARGAN  may  be  a  new- 
**  comer,  but  he's  learned  Hollywood's 
number! 

Everyone  was  rushing  up  to  congratulate 
him  on  his  performance  in  "Rain."  "You're 
great,  Bill.     Simply  wonderful." 

Billy  listened  for  several  days  and  then  he 
sent  for  a  couple  of  guys  he  knew.  "I  have  a 
job  for  you.  It  won't  last  long,  but  I  want  it 
done  well.  Everyone  is  giving  me  the  glad 
hand  about  'Rain.'  I  want  to  know  what 
people  really  think.  Mix  around  with  the 
crowd  and  knock  me.  Hear  what  they  have 
to  say.  I  want  a  true  report  on  how  I  went 
over." 

A  man  who  doesn't  believe  the  "yes"  men 
of  Hollywood  is  a  novelty — and  novelties 
make  news. 

"D  AN  into  Ann  Harding  the  other  day.  She 
was  looking  gorgeous.  Red  broadcloth 
suit  with  black  fox  collar  and  cuffs.  No  hat 
because  her  hair  is  thick  and  the  knot  on  the 
back  of  her  head  too  big  to  make  hats  be- 
coming. 

Two  months  ago  she  looked  like  a  ghost. 
Now  she's  the  prettiest  we've  ever  seen  her. 
Getting  a  little  plump,  viewed  from  a  film 
angle.  But  that's  glorious.  Shows  she's  got 
her  old  pep  back,  which  she  lost  so  completely 
when  she  and  Harry  Bannister  parted. 

But  she's  restless.  "I've  got  to  get  back  on 
the  stage.  If  only  for  four  months.  I  must 
get  away  from  here,"  she  says. 

The  stage  was  her  great  professional  love. 
Hollywood  has  not  been  too  kind  to  Ann.  It 
has  brought  her  heartache  and  shattered 
ideals.  Now  that  she  is  beginning  to  be  her- 
self again,  it  is  natural  she  should  turn  to  that 
first  love. 

Since  it's  that  way,  Ann,  we  hope  you  get 
your  wish.  But  you  will  probably  be  just  as 
glad  to  get  back  to  the  movies. 

"VOU'VE  heard  the  old  refrain,  "The  show 
must  go  on!" 

Stu  Erwin  reversed  that  favorite  recently: 
"The  show  must  wait."  After  all,  a  man 
doesn't  have  a  first-born  but  once  in  his  life. 

June  Collyer  Erwin  was  in  the  hospital 
waiting.  Stu's  picture,  "He  Learned  About 
Women"  was  ready  to  start.  And  Paramount 
waited  three  days — a  record  for  studio 
patience.    Stu  wouldn't  leave  his  wife! 

'PHE  lovely  Gwili  Andre  has  be- 
come  reconciled  to  the  idea  of 
bathing  in  public  in  "No  Other 
Woman." 

But  the  climax  was  reached  when 
a  studio  employee  and  ardent  ad- 
mirer of  Miss  Andre  asked  her  to 
autograph  the  tub  with  black  paint. 

Just  to  keep  among  his  souvenirs!

to  dub  in  the  sound  of  screaming,  but  Chat- 
terton  cut  loose  with  a  shriek  that  shook 
down  what  little  building  remained  standing.

THAT  HMtEAHED    TIME    OF 

MONTH! 


The  old  story.  "Cora's  sick !"  She  doesn't  know 
science  has  found  the  way  to  block  all  menstrual 
pain.  Midol,  the  discovery  of  specialists,  ends  such 
suffering.  It  does  not  merely  bring  relief,  but 
removes  every  vestige  of  pain.  And  it  does  this 
for  women  who  once  had  to  spend  the  day  in  bed ! 
Midol  is  a  specific  that  goes  straight  to  the  seat  of 
this  organic  pain.  You  can't  get  the  same  result 
from  any  headache  remedy.  Midol  is  an  absolute 
antidote  for  menstrual  pain  throughout  the  period. 
Midol  means  that  any  woman  can  menstruate  in 
absolute  comfort.  And  it  is  perfectly  harmless;  it  is 
not  a  narcotic.  At  any  drug  store;  ten  tiny  tablets 
in  a  smart  little  box.  Simply  ask  for  Midol.

Even  more  amazing,  it's  a  real  life  role.  Lupe  recently  adopted  her  sister's

("^  FORGE  WHITE,  famous  for  his  Broad-

Jeanette  MacDonald.  It  has  been  a  long  time 
since  Jeanette  played  in  New  York.  It  is 
known  that  Paramount  is  negotiating  with  her 
for  a  new  musical  and  M-G-M,  Radio  and 
Universal  have  also  made  overtures.  But 
just  what  Jeanette  is  planning  to  do  next,  only 
Jeanette  knows. 

JOEL  McCREA  and  William  Gargan  had 
J  never  met  before  they  reported  for  work  on 
"Sport  Parade."  It  was  a  fight  scene  and  the 
director  made  it  clear  they  were  not  to  pull 
their  punches.  And  then  Joel  interrupted. 
"Before  I  land  on  Mr.  Gargan's  jaw  don't  you 
think  we  ought  to  be  introduced?"  And  they 
both  laughed  so  hard  they  couldn't  shake 
hands.

Ann  may  go  to  London  to  play  "Holiday" 
on  the  stage.  "Holiday"  has  never  had  an 
English  production.  Leslie  Howard,  with 
whom  Ann  is  co-starring  in  "Animal  King- 
dom," is  author  of  the  London  idea.  He  will 
produce  "Holiday"  and  play  opposite  Ann  in 
it.  The  luck  of  the  English  theater-goers. 
What  a  production  that  will  be!

anything  against  Hollywood.  He's  anxious 
to  get  back  again  for  a  visit.  But  they  keep 
George  jumping  so  fast  from  one  picture  to 
another  these  days  he  just  can't  make  the  trip. 
And,  incidentally,  it's  being  rumored  about 
that  George's  wife  may  soon  be  hitting  the  trail 
for  Hollywood  to  sever  those  matrimonial 
ties.  George,  however,  is  mum  on  the  sub- 
ject.   Very  mum. 

T'YE  heard  tell  that  a  star  is  a  great  influence 
to  the  other  members  of  her  cast.  And  now  I 
know.  On  the  Ruth  Chatterton  set  for  "Frisco 
Jenny,"  there  was  Ruth  chewing  away  at 
her  inevitable  gum.  Her  stand-in  chewed 
even  harder,  the  director,  William  Wellman, 
never  let  up  for  a  moment,  the  cameraman 
chewed,  the  electricians  chewed  and  to  cap 
the  climax,  in  stepped  George  Thomas  from 
the  publicity  department.  He  took  one  look 
around  and  pulled  out  a  package  of  his  favorite 
gum.  A  regular  chewing  spree.  Now  beat 
that!

Paramount  was  cold  on  the  little  black-

"The  Phantom  President."  It  was  only  a  fair 
lead,  at  most,  because  the  picture  went  to 
the  men.  But  she  made  it  stand  out  like  a 
red  rose  on  a  black  Iwnnet.

A  ROUND  the  tea  table  in  Ruth  Chatter- 
ton's  studio  dressing-room,  there  sat  the 
other  day,  Ruth,  her  new  husband,  George 
Brent,  and  her  former  husband,  Ralph 
Forbes,  having  the  jolliest  time  you  can 
imagine. 

Kind  of  nice,  isn't  it,  to  have  no  bad  feelings 
in  the  family? 

\X7ELL,  well,  Rosco  Ates  went 
Izaak  Waltoning. 

He  caught  a  fish,  which  slipped  off 
the  hook,  which  hook  immediately 
sank  itself  into  Rosco's  bare  wrist. 

And  d-d-d-d-did  he  b-b-b-b-burn 
u-u-up? 

'"PHOSE  two  old  troupers,   Marie  Dressier 
and  Polly  Moran,  are  famous  for  "going 

up"  on  their  lines.     But  no  one  ever  blames 

them. 

People   who  are  loved  as  much  as   Marie 

and    Polly   somehow   don't    get    blamed    for 

little  things  like  forgetting. 

Incidentally,  "Prosperity"  was  slowed  up  in 

production  because  Marie  has  been  allowed  to 

work  only  four  hours  a  day.     She's  back  to 

perfect  health  again,  but  the  producers  want 

to  keep  her  that  way. 

JIMMY  DURANTE  was  ready  to  leave  for 
J  New  York  when  he  had  finished  "The  Phan- 
tom President"  with  George  M.  Cohan.  Jimmy 
hasn't  been  back  to  the  "sidewalks"  since 
Hollywood  made  him  famous.  And  did  he 
want  to  see  them  rise  to  pay  him  honor. 
Did  he!  But  Producer  Irving  Thalberg  said, 
"No.   We  may  need  you." 

Was  Jimmy  boined?  Jimmy  was  boined! 
He  dashed  off  into  the  high  mountains  of 
California  to  go  fishing.    And  he  didn't  leave 


any  address.  If  the  fish  won't  bite,  Jimmy's 
going  to  bite  the  fish  and  get  even. 

JANET  GAYNOR  is  the  most  pop- 
ular star  in  England.     Even  more 
popular  than  Garbo  or  Dietrich. 

JOAN  CRAWFORD  is  taking  singing  lessons. 
^  Old  Cal,  roaming  about  the  M-G-M  lot  the 
other  day,  wandered  onto  one  of  those  huge 
sound  stages  and  way  over  there  in  a  corner 
was  Joan  and  her  accompanist  practising  their 
"do  re  mi's"  for  dear  life.  And  you  should 
hear  Joan  sing  "You're  Blase"!  Dear  me! 
'Tis  rumored  all  these  singing  lessons  may  lead 
up  to  Joan  playing  "The  Merry  Widow." 
There's  usually  a  good  reason  behind  every- 
thing this  Miss  Crawford  does. 

'"pHEY  were  showing  a  visitor 
about  the  set  where  "The  Pen- 
guin Pool  Murder"  is  in  progress. 
"See  that  fish  there,"  they  pointed 
out,  "it's  insured  for  fifteen  hundred 
dollars  and  we  pay  one  hundred  and 
fifty  dollars  a  week  for  it." 

Whereupon  a  little  extra  behind 
them  piped  out,  "And  I  had  to  be 
born  a  human." 


JOAN  BLONDELL  came  out  of  the  theater 
J  after  the  preview  of  "Three  on  a  Match"  in  a 
rage.  Her  work  was  no  good,  she  said.  She 
was  through  with  pictures. 

Boy-friend  George  Barnes  said,  "All  right, 
honey.  You  stay  home.  When  we're  married, 
you  won't  have  to  work  any  more,  anyway." 

Well,  we're  banking  on  Joan's  next  picture 
living,  up  to  all  that's  been  expected  of  this 
smart  little  comedienne.

\\  atch  him,  and  you'll  learn  how  to 
make  yards." 

\\  ben  Cagle  related  this  to  Booth 
during  the  shooting  <>f  the  picture,  it 
was  tunny  for  everybody  but  Fred 
Linehan,  for  the  Army's  great  back 
and  Vale's  midget  quarter  ganged  on 
the  Vale  lineman  every  chance  they 
got  and  his  ribbing  came  home  to 
roost  .  .  .  with  three  years' interest. 
All  of  which  came  under  the  general 
heading  of  fun  on  a  football  field. 

Any  preconceived  notions  on  the 
part  of  the  players  that  their  trip  to 
Hollywood  was  going  to  be  just  a 
great  big  picnic,  vanished  when  they 
wenl  to  work.  During  a  college  foot- 
ball season  the  players  go  on  the 
field  at  half-past  three  for  practice 
and  play  until  dark  and  for  most 
teams  Thursday  and  Friday,  before 
a  game,  sees  only  signal  drill  and 
ri'st. 

Not  so  in  a  motion  picture.  They 
had  a  six  o'clock  call  at  the  hotel; 
breakfast  at  seven  and  they  were  on 
the  field  shortly  after  eight  .  .  . 
every  morning.  By  nine  the  cameras 
were  set  up  and  from  then  until 
late  afternoon,  when  the  light  was 
too  weak  to  photograph,  they  were 
hard  at  it.  And  no  football  players 
ever  fought  harder  for  the  dear  old 
Alma  Mater. 

"COR  that  reason  the  shooting  of 
•*■  the  football  scenes  took  only  four 
■weeks,  for  Director  Russell  Mack  found  he 
had  thirty  experienced  and  highly  trained 
actors — for  the  parts  they  were  playing.  If  he 
wanted  Arlen  to  knife  through  the  line  of  scrim- 
mage, almost  fall  when  half  tackled  but  break 
fret-  and  gain  good  yardage,  just  as  three  men 
were  cutting  down  the  backfield  for  him,  that 
is  exactly  what  happened,  with  speed  and 
precision  that  made  the  All  American  Foot- 
ball Hoard's  mouth  water. 

And  there  was  a  dramatic  moment  when  the 
players  were  first  introduced  to  Dick  Arlen  and 
Johnny  Darrow,  specially  Arlen. 

"He's  an  actor,"  the  athletes  said.  "He 
doesn't  want  to  meet  us." 


Lanky  Irvine  Phillips,  former  cap- 
tain and  end  for  California,  as  he 
is  about  to  let  fly  a  forward  pass 


"Gosh,  those  guys  are  famous."  This  from 
Dick  Arlen,  and  with  plenty  of  embarrassment. 
''They'll  laugh  themselves  to  death  when  they 
see  me  in  a  football  suit." 

BUT  Dick  did  want  to  meet  them  and  they 
did  not  laugh  themselves  to  death  for  the 
reason  that  Arlen  used  to  play  in  the  backfield 
for  St.  Thomas  College.  It  did  not  take  long 
for  some  of  the  feel  of  the  game  to  come  back  to 


him.  Once,  when  Dick  made  a  slash- 
ing tackle  of  the  elusive  Booth  and 
"Albie"  stayed  down,  too,  the  Yale 
quarterback  rolled  over  and  said: 

"You  certainly  tore  me  down, 
Dick.  You're  wasting  your  time  in 
Hollywood.  You  ought  to  be  on 
somebody's  football  team." 

When  the  players  discovered  that 
Arlen  and  Johnny  Darrow  made  first 
rate  football  players  and  when  Dick 
and  Johnny  discovered  the  athletes 
were  first  rate  actors — but  that's  the 
next  part  of  the  story. 

Very  few  of  the  players  were  self 
conscious  when  it  came  to  reading 
their  lines.  According  to  Director 
Russell  Mack,  the  acting  ability  of 
the  men  assayed  pretty  high,  with, 
of  course,  one  shining  exception. 
That  was  the  great  Ernie  Nevers, 
who  is  rated  by  "Pop"  Warner  as 
one  of  the  outstanding  players  of  all 
time.  Now  Ernie  doesn't  know  how 
to  lose  his  temper,  but  he  was  sup- 
posed to  fly  into  a  blistering  rage  at 
Arlen,  supposed  to  have  taken 
money  to  "throw"  a  game. 

Well,  they  worked  until  three 
o'clock  in  the  morning  on  that  scene, 
but  Frnie  simply  couldn't  get  mad. 
Finally  the  despairing  director  had 
an  idea. 

"Don't  get  mad,  Ernie,"  he  said, 
"just  look  surprised."  And  it  went 
that  way,  for  a  surprised  Nevers  is 
far  more  dangerous  looking  than  an 
angry  one  and  if  you  don't  believe  this,  just 
ask  them  at  California,  or  Oregon,  or  Washing- 
ton State  or  Southern  California. 

And  as  for  the  comedy  scenes  in  the  picture. 
A  number  of  them  were  extemporaneous,  like 
the  scene  between  Johnny  Baker  and  "Hurry" 
Cain,  the  drawling  Alabama  player.  After 
Cain  had  monopolized  the  sponge  and  water 
bucket  during  a  rest  period,  for  too  long  to  suit 
the  California  linesman,  the  latter  said: 

"How  about  some  of  that  water  for  me?" 
"Pahdon  me,"  drawled  Cain,   "I   thought 
all  you  Californians  drahnk  nothin'  but  orange 
juice  out  here. " 

And  when  "Hurry"  was  having  his  bruised 


The  All  American  and  All  Star  teams,  who  display  their  most  brilliant  football  in  the  film,  "The  Ail-American."

nose  bandaged,  he  kept  putting  his  hands  up 
to  it  until  the  doctor  slapped  it  away  with  the 
curt  admonition:  "Keep  your  hands  off  that 
thing." 

"But  doctah,"  protested  Cain,  "ah'm  in- 
terested in  that  thing." 

After  the  four  weeks  of  work,  into  which 
they  crammed  more  football  than  most  teams 
see  in  four  seasons,  were  over,  the  players 
scattered  again.  "Albie"  Booth  wanted  to  re- 
main to  act  in  pictures,  but  he  went  back  East, 
to  attack  the  picture  business  from  another 
angle,  the  selling  end.  Fred  Linehan  remained 
to  play  extra  parts.  But  the  others  have  all 
gone,  leaving  only  a  photographic  record  of 
modern  football  as  all  players  have  dreamed 
it  should  be  played. 

A  ND  this  record  has  been  woven  into  a 
■*Mramatic  story  about  two  brothers,  Dick 
Arien  the  elder,  and  Johnny  Darrow  the 
younger.  It  tells  how  Dick,  an  All  American, 
became  ensnared  by  a  college  siren,  sold  out 


to  get  money  for  her  and  thus  achieved  dis- 
aster. 

After  he  has  vanished,  his  young  brother 
becomes  an  All  American  on  a  later  team  in 
the  same  school  and  he,  too,  falls  for  the  siren. 

Matters  come  to  a  climax  during  a  charity 
game  played  by  the  1931  All  American  team 
against  a  collection  of  former  All  American 
stars.  It  is  in  this  game  that  we  see  all  the 
football  great  in  action,  and  it  is  during  this 
torrid  struggle  that  Dick,  playing  with  the 
older  team,  manages  to  fight  his  kid  brother, 
on  the  1931  team,  back  into  the  paths  of 
straight  and  narrow  football  and  morals. 

T  TNDER  the  direction  of  the  Football 
*^-Board,  Frank  Carideo  and  Rockne's  former 
assistant,  Mannie  Vezie,  almost  every  sensa- 
tional play  of  the  past  few  years  has  been 
utilized  and  put  into  execution  by  these  two 
dream  teams,  whose  coming  together  resulted 
in  a  great  picture  and  perhaps  the  greatest  thrill 
a  dyed-in-the-wool  football  fan  will  ever  get.

Why  Clark  Gable 

Says  "I  Am  Paid 

Not  to  Think" 

|  CONTINUED  FROM  J'AGL  29  ] 


"  Possessed."  She  insisted  with  vehemence, 
too. 

Even  went  to  the  "front  office"  and  refused 
to  make  the  picture  unless  Clark  played  op- 
posite her. 

The  parts  chanced  to  fit  his  screen  person- 
ality in  these  pictures.  But  the  race  was  on. 
Marion  Davies  must  have  her  turn  and 
Norma  another  chance  since  Joan  had  him 
twice.  The  fact  that  he  didn't  fit  the  part 
in  Norma's  "Strange  Interlude"  was  forgot- 
ten. Women  are  apt  to  forget  seemingly  minor 
points  when  they  are  fighting  for  their  own 
way.  Even  Greta  Garbo  must  have  her  turn. 
The  role  in  "  Susan  Lenox "  was  not  appro- 
priate, either. 

TN  none  of  these  cases  was  Gable  asked 
-'■whether  he  would  like  to  play  the  picture.  "I 
found  out  I  was  going  to  do  'Susan  Lenox'  in 
Del  Monte,"  he  says.  "Read  it  in  the  paper. 
I  also  read  in  the  paper  that  I  am  to  go  to  Par- 
amount to  play  with  Miriam  Hopkins  in  'Xo 
Man  of  Her  Own.' 

"When  I  walked  on  the  lot,  one  day,  they 
told  me  I  was  to  play  'Red  Dust'  in  place  of 
Jack  Gilbert. " 

"But  'Red  Dust'  is  great  for  you,  isn't  it, 
Clark?" 

"  It  was  originally  chosen  for  Greta  Garbo. " 

"But  you  have  a  strong,  virile  role  in  'Red 
Dust'  "— 

"It  was  bought  for  Greta  Garbo." 

I  paused;  looked  at  him  closely.  His  face 
was  non-committal.  The  story  had  been 
bought  to  star  a  woman.  And  unless  they 
changed  the  script  completely,  it  was  a  wom- 
an's story.  Jean  Harlow!  Since  our  conver- 
sation, "Red  Dust"  has  been  released.  The 
script  was  evidently  changed,  because  it 
emerges  as  a  man's  story — Clark's — and  only 
the  exceptional  performance  of  Jean  Harlow 
made  her  part  equal  to  his. 

Well,  men  had  been  starred  before  in  a 
woman's  story. 

"What  should  a  story  contain  to  make  it 
interesting?"  I  asked. 

He  took  his  time  answering,  as  though  think- 
ing aloud.  He  had  forgotten  he  was  paid  not 
to  think. 

"You  must  have  characters  in  a  play  in 
which  the  audience  is  sufficiently  interested  to 
care  what  happens  to  them.  I  learned  that  in 
stock.  It  is  true  of  pictures.  The  characters 
in  themselves  must  be  interesting.  As  they 
were  in  'Possessed.'  If  the  character  isn't  in- 
teresting, no  actor  can  make  him  so. 

"  I  did  a  play  on  the  stage.  It  did  not  reach 
New  York.  I  would  like  to  do  it  in  pictures. 
It  was  called  'Broken  Windows.'  ". 

SUDDENLY  he  stopped,  looking  r.s  though 
he  had  awakened  abruptly  from  a  dream. 
He  laughed,  slightly  embarrassed. 

I  changed  the  subject  quickly.  "How's your 
polo?"  I  asked. 

"I  don't  play  polo  any  more." 

"Oh,  I  forgot.  They  won't  let  you  play  be- 
cause it's  too  dangerous. " 

"  Yes,  they  just  want  to  give  me  more  of  the 
kind  of  work  I  have  been  doing,  so  I  can  play 
polo  sooner. " 

Some  bite  in  those  words! 

For  a  man  of  whom  thinking  is  neither  ex- 
pected nor  wanted,  it  seems  to  me  that  Clark 
Gable's  mind  is  exceptionally  active. 

Can't  you  read  between  the  lines  one  of  the 
outstanding  reasons  for  his  great  popularity 
and  success?

Barbaric  Touches  Enliven 
Hollywood's  New  Costumes 


32

by  Sey 


HOLLYWOOD  seems  to  he  torn  between 
looking  quaint  and  going  primitive!  The 
two  trends  are  certainly  far  enough  re- 
moved from  each  other — but  the  gist  of  the 
thing  is  that  barbaric  notes  in  costume  jewelry 
and  accessory  trappings  have  come  in  with  the 
vogue  for  jungle  and  exotic  Far-East  pictures. 
Pagan  ladies  on  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross"  set 
are  weighted  down  with  heavy  metal  jewelry. 
And  Tala  Birell,  in  "Magana,"  wears  African 
tribal  necklace  and  bracelets.  A  gauntlet  of 
silver  rings  is  one  of  these  bracelets.  There  are 
lots  of  metal  and  wooden  gadgets  being  seen 


Shades  of  Nero's  time!  Here's  the 
sort  of  trappings  that  pagan  ladies 
loved.  Frances  Dee  is  wearing  this 
one  of  heavy  silver  discs  on  a  silver 
chain  to  show  you  how  smart  primitive 
jewelry  can  look  with  your  modern 
clothes.  Frances  borrowed  this,  in- 
cidentally, from  one  of  the  lovely  pagans 
on  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross"  set.  Note 
that  the  necklace  clasps  at  the  side  front 


mour 


about  town  and  it  is  a  trend  to  watch  care- 
fully. Incidentally,  those  heavy  metal  neck- 
laces are  lovely  when  worn  with  the  plain  high 
necklines  of  current  fashions. 

"DLACK  velvet  is  almost  a  Hollywood 
■'-'uniform  for  evenings  this  winter.  The  other 
night  at  a  night  club  opening  I  spotted  any 
number  of  stunning  gowns  or  ensembles  in 
velvet.  Joan  Blondell  was  wearing  a  dress 
with  a  high  square  neck  in  front  and  deep  V  in 
the  back.  Over  this  went  a  black  velvet  jacket 
with  high  collar  and  puff  sleeves  of  sable. 

Colleen  Moore  wore  a  black  velvet  with  puff 
sleeves  of  ermine;  her  wrap  wag  a  sleeveless 
bolero  of  the  fur.    A  clever  idea. 

JOAN  CRAWFORD  appeared  at  a  play  open- 
J  ing  in  Los  Angeles,  wearing  a  wine  red  velvet 
ensemble  that  had  a  most  unique  wrap.  It  had 
only  one  sleeve  caught  into  a  tight  cuff  and  the 
other  side  of  the  wrap  was  a  wide  cape.  That's 
a  thought  to  jot  down  for  your  next  evening 
appointment. 

Olga  Baclanova,  who  is  appearing  in  the 
stage  production  of  "The  Cat  and  the  Fiddle," 
essays  a  most  daring  costtime  color  combina- 
tion. She  wears  a  street  outfit  in  yellow,  brown 
and  deeper-than-coral  shades.  That  alone  is 
striking — but  wait,  with  this  she  wears  two 
wide  bracelets  in  two  subtle  shades  of  red!  It 
takes  a  real  flair  for  chic  to  attempt  anything 
like  that. 

/^AROLE  LOMBARD'S  next  picture  offers 
^some  advance  summer  fashion  tips.  She 
wears,  for  instance,  a  zebra  print  dress  in  green 
and  white.  Sounds  stunning,  doesn't  it? 
Watch  striped  effects — they  will  get  a  big  hand. 
Carole  is  very  fussy  about  her  accessories.  She 
has  to  have  just  the  right  shades  for  every 
costume — even  hosiery  shades  are  chosen  with 
a  hawk  eye  for  matching. 

Red  fox  is  increasingly  popular  with  the 
stars.  And  Connie  Bennett  wears  a  collar  of 
cross  fox  with  muff  to  match  on  a  tightly 
belted  navy  blue  coat.  She  likes  those  little 
hats  that  are  slashed  to  show  a  bit  of  hair,  too. 

OPEAKING  of  fur,  muffs  are  a  rage  out  here. 
'-'No  coat  or  suit  is  quite  complete  without 
one.  And  they  are  all  sizes  from  the  tiny 
barrel  ones  to  huge  pillow  ones. 

At  luncheon  the  other  noon,  I  spotted  Minna 
Gombel  wearing  an  audacious  little  brown  felt 
sailor  with  a  gold  and  green  feather  poised  in 
the  very  center  front.

The  second  agreement  was  a  protection 
against  their  becoming  involved  in  social  en- 
gagements where  the  parties  were  likely  to  be 
professional  rather  than  amusing. 

They  didn't  agree  before  marriage,  however, 


not  to  discuss  each  other's  work.  They  just

for  preventing 

Colds 

-a  clean  system! 


If  you're  nursing  a  cold,  see  a  doctor. 
Curing  a  cold  is  his  business.  But  the 
doctor  himself  will  tell  you  that  you 
can  do  much  to  make  yourself  less 
susceptible  to  colds. 

During  the  colds  season  it  is  more 
important  than  ever  to  "keep  regular." 
A  clean  system  is  vital  in  building 
natural  resistance  to  colds. 

But  when  you  use  a  laxative,  be  sure 
it  is  gentle!  It  is  not  safe  to  experiment. 

What  Doctors  look  for  in 
a  Laxative 

The  perfect  laxative,  according  to  physi- 
cians, slfould  be  as  mild  as  it  is  effective. 
It  should  limit  its  action  to  the  intestines. 
It  should  not  disturb  digestion.  It  should 
not  gripe.  It  should  not  be  habit-forming. 

Ex-Lax  checks  on  every  point! 
That's  why  so  many  leading  physicians 
approve  the  Ex-Lax  way. 

Ex-Lax  is  simply  phenolphthalein  — 
that  favorite  scientific  laxative  agent 
— combined  with  delicious  chocolate, 
in  the  correct  quality,  the  correct  pro- 
portion and  the  correct  dose. 

Help  prevent  colds  this  way! 

Heed  Nature's  laws  closely,  and  you 
won't  catch  cold  so  easily.  When 
Nature  needs  help — take  an  Ex-Lax 
or  two.  Its  pleasant  taste  and  gentle- 
ness make  Ex-Lax  perfect  for  children 
as  well  as  grown-ups.  But — be  sure  you 
get  genuine  Ex-Lax — leader  for  26  years! 
Just  "any"  laxative  won't  do.  It  takes 
Ex-Lax  to  get  Ex-Lax  results. 

Try  Ex-Lax  tonight! 

You  can  get  Ex-Lax  at  all  drug  stores,  10c,

Best  Remedy  is  Made 
At  Home 

To  half  pint  of  water  ndd  one 
ounce  bay  rum,  a  small  box  of  Barbo 
Compound  and  one-fourth  ounce  of 
glycerine.  Any  druprgist  can  put  this 
up  or  you  can  mix  it  at  home  at 
very  little  cost.  Apply  to  the  hair 
twice  a  week  until  the  desired  shade 
is  obtained.  It  imparts  color  to 
streaked,  faded  or  gray  hair  and 
makes  it  soft  and  glossy.  Barbo  will 
not  color  the  scalp,  is  not  sticky  or 
greasy  and  does  not  rub  off. 


a  canine  discussion.  Soon,  her  bad  day  is 
forgotten.  Or  I  will  come  home  and  say, 
'Damn.  When  can  we  get  over  to  Europe?' 
and  we  are  into  a  travelogue. 

"It's  just  a  form  of  selfishness  for  a  husband 
or  wife  bo  bring  home  professional  troubles. 
The  other  one  never  gets  a  fair  picture  of  what 
really  happened,  anyway.  Everyone  tells 
only  his  side  of  troubles.  Which  would  be  a 
bit  dangerous  in  our  family.  Kay  is  so 
irritatingly  honest!  If  I  sat  down  to  dinner 
and  told  about  a  scene  I'd  had  to  make  thirty 
times  and  blamed  some  temperamental 
actress,  she'd  probably  say:  'And  what  did  you 
do  or  not  do  to  make  her  temperamental?'  She 
knows  about  directors,  of  course,  being  an 
actress!" 

Kay  nodded  and  added,  "Kenneth  would  do 
the  same.  He  knows  about  actresses,  being  a 
director!" 

Y\  7IIICII  seems  pretty  wise,  doesn't  it? 
W  What  good  does  it  really  do  to  make 
hash  from  a  day's  difficulties?  Far  better  tc 
help  one  forget  them! 

They  do  tell  the  funny  things,  however. 
While  Kenneth  was  directing  "Careless  Lady," 
he  was  full  of  dog  stories.  They  had  a  trained 
canine  in  it.  Kay  felt  as  though  she  were 
personally  acquainted  with  the  clever  little 
actor;  she  heard  so  much  about  him  at  the 
dinner  table.  But  she  couldn't  have  told  you 
that  her  husband  was  directing  Joan  Bennett! 

Then  there  was  the  tale  of  the  girl  who  was 
almost  hired  for  a  part  in  one  of  Kenneth's 
pictures.  The  main  requirement  was  a  beauti- 
ful figure  as  she  was  to  be — ah,  scantily  clad. 
This  youngster  was  French  and  pretty  as  a 
camellia.  Said  Kenneth  to  this  girl:  "I  think 
you  will  do." 

"But  you  haven't  seen  my  pictures!"  she 
protested.  * 

"But  I've  seen  you." 

Still  the  girl  insisted  upon  showing  him  the 
pictures.  They  were  in  the  nude.  She  was 
not  hired. 

Of  course,  that  was  a  good  story  for  any 
husband  to  tell  his  wife  at  the  dinner  table. 
Kenneth  didn't  miss  the  opportunity.  Kay 
told  me  about  it — but  she  didn't  remember 
the  name  of  the  picture  or  of  the  girl  who  was 
hired. 

There  promised  to  be  difficulties  about 
sports.  Kay  was  mad  about  tennis;  Kenneth 
about  golf.  Each  played  his  favorite  sport 
every  day  ("including  Sundays)  they  were  not 
working  before  they  were  married.  Neither 
knew  nor  enjoyed  the  game  of  the  other. 

So  they  bought  a  boat  almost  as  soon  as  the 
ceremony  was  over.  A  small,  thirty-six  foot 
sailing  schooner.  Now,  they  spend  every  non- 
working  day  on  that.  You'll  find  them  every 
Sunday  headed  toward  Catalina.  When 
Kenneth  is  working  and  Kay  isn't,  she  re- 
turns to  tennis.    And  vice  versa  with  his  golf. 

The  boat  sounds  like  a  luxury.     It  isn't. 


Last  year,  it  cost  them  a  few  cents  under  one 
thousand  dollars  for  the  entire  twelve  months. 
The  reason?  No  crew;  no  cook;  no  maids. 
Kay  is  cook,  maid  and  stewardess.  Kenneth 
is  captain,  sailor  and  deck  swabber.  When  the 
boat  needed  cleaning,  they  were  at  Catalina. 
Kenneth  spent  his  day  diving  beneath  it  to 
clean  off  barnacles! 

When  either  is  working  they  have  no  social 
engagements.  They  broke  this  rule  one  eve- 
ning to  attend  a  dinner  at  Ben  Schulberg's. 
Kay  said,  in  accepting  the  invitation. "When 
ten-thirty  comes.  I  will  leave.    I  am  working." 

She  did.  Right  in  the  middle  of  dinner! 
Kenneth  drove  her  home  and  returned  to  the 
party.     He  was  not  working. 

The  usual  evening  formula  on  working  days 
is  dinner,  with  Kay  still  in  make-up.  Then 
each  takes  a  book,  crawls  into  his  separate  bed 
and  reads  until  sleep  conquers. 

Someone  told  me  recently  that  Kay  Francis 
is  no  longer  the  best-dressed  woman  in  Holly- 
wood. "She  has  so  few  clothes.  Mostly 
sports  things  and  yachting  costumes." 

I  told  Kenneth.  He  laughed.  "Kay  can't 
help  but  be  best-dressed.  You  know  what  I 
mean?  She  puts  on  a  pair  of  blue  trousers  and 
sweater  on  the  boat  and  washes  dishes  and  she 
still  looks  swagger!" 

Yes,  I  knew.  In  New  York,  Kay  was  "best- 
dressed."  The  day  she  stepped  from  the  train 
in  Los  Angeles,  the  newspapers  shot  pictures 
of  her  swank  trimness  and  captioned  the 
pictures:  "A  new  best-dressed  woman  for 
Hollywood." 

She  doesn't  need  many  clothes  for  that  repu- 
tation. And  she  hasn't  the  number  she  had 
before  she  was  married.  She  averaged  six 
parties  a  week  then.  "But  when  I  married,  I 
settled  down,  I  suppose.  That's  civilized, 
isn't  it?" 

■""THEY  quarrel.  How  they  quarrel!  They 
-^  are  like  two  trim,  intelligent  race  horses 
competing  for  sweepstake  honors.  Their  most 
recent  battle  concerned  a  proposed  European 
trip.  One  wanted  the  extreme  northern 
route;  the  other  the  extreme  southern.  Both 
were  decided  upon  Budapest  as  a  destination 
but  determined  that  their  pet  routes  were  the 
best  way  to  reach  it.  They  battled  all  the 
way  from  Hollywood  to  Santa  Barbara — as 
only  high-strung,  intelligent  people  can  battle. 

And  at  Santa  Barbara  they  discovered  that 
neither  was  right.  The  best  way  was  a  com- 
pletely neutral  route! 

"Which  only  proves  that  arguments  like 
that  are  usually  for  nothing,"  Kenneth 
grinned.  "But  they're  fun — after  they're 
over." 

But  never  a  professional  discussion!  And 
if  that  isn't  the  magic  key  to  Hollywood 
matrimony,  I'll  shift  my  bet  to  Marlene 
Dietrich  and  her  husband.  I  don't  know  what 
they  talk  about.  The  conversations  are  in 
German!

playmates.  He  was  always  clean.  If  he 
started  from  the  door  with  a  bit  of  dust  on  his 
shoes,  his  mother  called  him  back  and  brushed 
it  off.  His  shirts  might  be  frayed,  but  they 
were  clean  and  the  frays  were  neatly  mended. 

At  fourteen  he  ran  away  from  home. 
Patched  breeches  and  mended  collars  were  not 
for  the  "man''  George.  Hoys  become  men 
early — in  the  Tenderloin  district. 

His  first  job  was  helper  to  an  electrician. 
four  dollars  a  week.  Not  enough  for  clothes. 
And  he  couldn't  even  keep  clean.    Not  so  good! 

Some  of  the  other  "guys''  from  his  district 
who  had  escaped  as  he  did  were  ring  fighting 


and  getting  paid  for  it.  As  high  as  ten  dollars 
a  night.  Money  for  suits,  shirts  and  collars. 
George  knew  he  was  no  pugilist.  But  he  was 
willing  to  take  beatings  as  long  as  he  was  paid 
for  them.  He  still  wears  the  scars  of  those  en- 
counters. But  he  didn't  object  to  torn  ears  or 
gashes  or  bulging  eyes  as  long  as  he  could  slip 
into  a  fresh  suit  when  the  fight  was  finished. 

One  day  he  noticed  a  boy  delivering  a  parcel 
at  a  Park  Avenue  door.  The  boy  was  in  uni- 
form. Bright,  handsome  brass  buttons.  He 
noted  the  name  on  the  delivery  truck.  A  week 
later  he  was  delivering  furs  from  that  exclusive 
shop  to  those  exclusive  doors.     Every  brass

button  of  that  uniform  was  a  mirror!  His 
fighting  days  were  over. 

His  first  dance  halls  were  the  sawdust  floors 
of  new  markets.  Dances  were  the  vogue  for 
market  openings.  His  pals  knew  he  could 
dance.  They  urged  him  to  volunteer  a  per- 
formance. He  refused  until  he  was  dared. 
A  Tenderloin  lad  rises  or  falls  on  dares.  He 
looked  down  at  his  new  suit.  Only  a  quarter 
in  its  new  pocket.  He  danced.  The  crowd 
threw  money.  Dance  halls.  Vaudeville.  Caba- 
rets. An  absolute  sensation  as  the  interpreter 
of  the  Black  Bottom. 

Excellent  tuxedos  could  be  purchased  for 
sixty-five  dollars.  But  George  Raft  paid  one 
hundred  and  twenty-five  dollars  for  his.  And 
he  bought  them  often.  He  soon  learned  that 
his  one  passion  had  an  economic  advantage. 
If  a  man  looked  the  "best  dressed"  he  was 
treated  as  though  he  had  money,  even  though 
a  couple  of  dollars  in  the  pocket  was  his  only 
capital! 

"T  HAVE  always  been  able  to  get  credit.  Men 

■*■  trust  me.  Tailors,  especially.  I  looked  as 
though  I  could  pay!" 

Clothes  helped  his  career  as  a  dancer.  You 
have  heard  him  called  a  gigolo.  George  gets 
pretty  burned  up  about  that.  Someone  asked 
him  if  he  was  paid  for  dancing  and  he  said 
"Yes" — hence  the  gigolo.  He  admits  he 
doesn't  know  whether  to  get  vicious  about  that 
name  or  just  laugh  it  off  and  let  it  go.  He 
thinks  it  will  probably  be  less  trouble  to  laugh 
it  off.  He  was  paid  six  hundred  and  fifty  dol- 
lars a  week  for  one  dance  a  night  in  London. 
The  highest  paid  dancer  to  go  to  Europe.  He 
danced  at  the  Vanderbilt  home;  he  danced  for 
the  prince  of  Sweden.  He  went  back  into 
vaudeville. 

His  eventual  entry  into  pictures  was  purely 
accidental.  He  was  hanging  around  New  York 
and  Hollywood.  Just  commuting.  Vaude- 
ville had  refused  him  his  former  salary,  so  he 
left  vaudeville.  Cabarets  had  gone  the  way  of 
the  depression.  He  was  the  best  dressed  man 
on  Broadway  and  at  the  Brown  Derby  and 
Cocoanut  Grove.  Women  eyed  him.  He 
didn't  eye  back.    Twice  as  interesting. 

Roland  Brown  volunteered  a  part — a  gang- 
ster in  "Quick  Millions."  He  took  it.  Easy 
money.  A  new  suit.  He  thought  he'd  go  back 
to  New  York  when  it  was  finished. 

And  then  came  "Scarface"!  And  a  Para- 
mount contract.  Although  George  has  made 
three  pictures  since  that  one,  he's  still  on  his 
low  starting  salary.  His  salary  hasn't  kept 
pace  with  his  fame  by  any  means.  Not  a  new 
Hollywood  situation  for  sudden  sensations. 

In  "Night  After  Night"  he  reaches  his 
zenith.  He  knew  he  would  as  soon  as  he  read 
the  script.  It  might  have  been  written  from 
his  own  knowledge  of  life. 

rPHE  wardrobe  department  handed  him  a 
-*■  double  breasted  suit.  He  took  one  look  and 
said  they'd  have  to  wait  until  he  purchased  the 
proper  clothes  for  the  picture.  They  waited. 
He  went  to  a  tailor.  He  didn't  have  the  money 
— his  expenses  as  well  as  his  fame  had  gone 
beyond  his  immediate  pocketbook,  but  the 
tailor  trusted  him.  Made  him  eight  hundred 
dollars'  worth  of  clothes  on  credit.  George 
didn't  let  Paramount  provide  one  suit  for 
"  Night  After  Night."  He  wanted  each  one  as 
he  wanted  it! 

The  tailor  ran  an  advertisement  congratulat- 
ing George  on  his  work  in  the  picture,  in  a  local 
trade  paper — and  the  tailor  paid  for  the  ad. 

Yet,  George  doesn't  have  many  suits.  Just 
sixteen  or  seventeen.  There's  a  reason.  He'll 
be  sitting  with  a  pal  in  the  Brown  Derby  and 
look  him  over.  "I've  got  a  suit  I  think'll  fit 
you.     Better  come  and  try  it  on." 

"I'll  pay  you  for  it,  George." 

"Oh,  that's  all  right." 

That  happens  about  once  a  week.  But  if  the 
day  ever  comes  when  they  try  to  put  George 
Raft  into  a  costume  picture!  Tunic  and  bare 
le^s,  for  example.  Ouch!  That  day  will  bring 
a  great  dancer  and  a  great  actor  back  to  New 
York  City.  But  not  to  the  Tenderloin  district!

It  was  just  15  years  ago 
that  Ethel  Barrymore  was 
making  "The  Awaken- 
ing of  Helena  Ritchie" 


And  15  years  ago  we  inter- 
viewed charming  Billie 
Burke  and  one-year- 
old  daughter,  Patricia 


15  Years  Ago 


TN  December,  1917,  we  had  a  page  of  pictures 
-'-called  "Just  Five  Years  Ago,"  and  expressed 
horror  that  Francis  X.  Bushman,  the  great 
screen  lover,  had  been  doing  "character  parts"- 
— burlesque  country  constables  and  the  like — 
only  five  years  before.  We  showed  Arthur 
Johnson,  who  had  passed  on  in  1916;  John 
Bunny  and  Flora  Finch;  Maurice  Costello  and 
Florence  Lawrence.  Billie  Burke  was  on  the 
cover  and  we  had  a  story  that  said  she  looked 
about  sixteen,  in  spite  of  year-old  daughter, 
Patricia. 

We  reviewed  the  latest  Ethel  Barrymore 
release,  "The  Lifted  Veil,"  and  praised  it 
highly,  but  said,  "Miss  Barrymore  is  dignified 


and  serious — perhaps  too  much  so."  And, 
strangely  enough,  in  that  same  issue  we  ran  a 
Actionized  story  of  the  motion  picture,  "The 
Fall  of  the  Romanoffs."  Nance  O'Neil  was 
the  Czarina,  the  role  Ethel  Barrymore  is  just 
completing  in   "Rasputin." 

We  showed  a  "happy  home"  picture  of 
Geraldine  Farrar  and  Lou  Tellegen.  In  an 
article  about  Olive  Thomas  we  quoted  her 
almost  prophetic  words,  "Life's  too  short  and 
fate  too  funny  to  get  upstage."  A  page  of 
pictures  introduced  "Wally  Reid,  Jr."  just 
one  month  old. 

Cal  York  item:  Charlie  Chaplin  took  a 
whole    month's    vacation    from     the    studio. 


10  Years  Ago 


HTEN  years  ago,  just  as  today,  we  were  say- 
*•  ing,  "Conrad  Nagel  is  one  of  the  exemplary 
young  men  of  the  Hollywood  colony."  Yes, 
ma'am,  that  was  the  caption  we  used  under 
his  picture  in  the  gallery.  We  printed  what 
was  probably  the  first  magazine  interview 
with  Ernst  Lubitsch  and  called  him  "the 
master  of  tragedy."  His  recent,  "The  Man  I 
Killed"  still  bears  that  out,  but  how  about  the 
sly,  vivacious  "Love  Parade,"  "The  Smiling 
Lieutenant"  and  his  new  "Trouble  in  Para- 
dise"? 

We  worried  about  Jackie  Coogan,  who  was 
growing  old  fast!  He  was  just  approaching 
seven,  but  we  wondered  what  would  happen 


wrhen  he  reached  nine — or  ten.  Well,  we  were 
right.    The  screen  lost  him. 

Three  pages  were  given  to  pictures  of  the 
beloved  Mabel  Normand  in  her  new  Paris 
wardrobe.  And  a  page  to  Laurette  Taylor  as 
"Peg  O'  My  Heart."  And,  in  "Wedded  and 
Parted,"  we  told  the  story  of  Natacha  Ram- 
bova  and  Rudolph  Valentino. 

It  was  announced  that  "Tol'able  David," 
starring  Richard  Barthelmess,  had  won  the 
Second  Photoplay  Medal  of  Honor. 

Cal  York  item:  Rudolph  Valentino  at- 
tended the  Broadway  premiere  of  Rex  In- 
gram's picture,  "Trifling  Women,"  and  re- 
ceived   more    applause     than    the    picture. 


5  Years  Ago 


JOAN  CRAWFORD  was  on  the  cover,  look- 
J  ing  utterly  unlike  the  sophisticated  Joan  of 
today.  Gary  Cooper  was  in  the  gallery  and 
we  said  he  was  reported  engaged  to  Clara 
Bow  and  had  been  given  a  leading  part  in 
"Beau  Sabreur."  "What  more,"  we  asked, 
, 'could  any  young  fellow  possibly  want?" 
Evidently  it  wasn't  enough,  for  Gary  seems 
still  to  be  looking  for  happiness. 

We  printed  "The  True  Life  Story  of  Lon 
Chancy,"  and  the  interviewer  confessed  she 
almost  wished  she  hadn't  agreed  to  get  it. 
"To  write  such  a  man  as  I  saw  him,  detail  his 
character,  his  grandeur,  his  work,  frightens 
me.    May  I  do  him  justice!''     ■ 


"Beau  Geste"  won  the  Seventh  Photoplay 
Medal  of  Honor.  We  reviewed  "My  Best 
Girl"  and  said  it  was  "the  best  picture  Mary 
Pickford  has  made  in  several  years."-  And 
about  King  Vidor's  "The  Crowd,"  we  com- 
mented, "Here  you  have  Life,  as  it  is  lived  by 
millions  in  New  York  and  other  big  cities 
where  the  crowd  walks,  pushes,  tramples  each 
individual  member." 

Norma  Shearer  posed  for  our  Star  Recipes 
page  and  showed  how  to  make  Canadian  Oat- 
meal Sticks.  Mack  Sennett  included  Carole 
Lombard  in  his  selection  of  "Beauties." 

Cal  York  item:  Greta  Garbo  and  John 
Gilbert  are  not  "going  together"  any  more. 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  December,  1932 


The  New  Way  of  Finding  Screen  Stars 

[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  85  ] 


slimness,  unless  she  is  to  play  character  roles. 
The  same  principle  applies  to  the  minute  mus- 
taches of  many  screen  heroes.  A  full  sized 
mustache  would  photograph  like  the  old-fash- 
ioned whiskers  of  the  '90's.  Even  the  pencil- 
line  eyebrows  of  the  girls  must  be  exaggerated 
in  their  thinness,  to  thwart  the  camera  which 
partially  flattens  out  every  rounded  surface. 

THE  first  photographic  test  is  with  a  silent 
camera.  The  girl  whose  usual  carefully 
lighted  photograph,  after  retouching,  is  ad- 
mired by  her  friends,  gets  a  terrific  shock  when 
she  sees  the  first  studio  "still."  "Camera 
angles"  have  been  ignored;  lights  have  been 
played  on  her  from  all  directions,  showing  up 
every  irregularity  and  blemish;  there  has  been 
no  retouching. 

She  is  bad  enough  in  the  close-ups,  but 
wait  until  she  sees  those  long-shots,  showing 
how  she  moves  across  a  room,  how  she  uses 
her  hands  and  arms,  how  she  turns  her  head. 

"My  heavens,  do  I  look  like  that?"  is  a 
typical  comment  made  when  such  a  girl  first 
sees  herself  on  the  screen.  "What  made  me 
think  I  could  act  in  pictures?"  "Why  didn't 
anyone  ever  tell  me  I  walked  like  that?"  All 
these  are  familiar  exclamations  when  tests  are 
being  run  off. 

Of  course,  it  is  impossible  to  judge  ability 
solely  by  the  silent  test.  Perhaps  the  girl's 
voice  will  aid  her  immeasurably — in  a  silent 
test  she  hasn't  the  help  of  normal  facial  ex- 
pressions in  speaking.  Or,  vice  versa,  the  sound 
camera  may  reveal  that  she  grimaces  far  too 
much  when  she  talks. 

But  the  silent  test  is  a  great  help  in  deter- 
mining the  lightness  of  the  make-up,  whether 
the  arrangement  of  hair  is  pleasing,  how  the 
girl  carries  herself,  how  she  balances  her  body 
with  her  hands. 

If  she  qualifies  in  the  silent  test,  she  goes  into 
rehearsal  for  a  week.  With  two  or  three  other 
players,  also  awaiting  tests,  she  is  drilled  in  a 
short  sketch.  Unlike  some  companies,  the 
Fox  director  casts  his  players  as  carefully  as 
for  an  actual  picture.  He  chooses  a  vehicle 
that  suits  their  types,  (often  a  scene  from  a 
play  in  which  they  have  appeared),  and  groups 


people  who  should  perform  well  together. 

Working  conditions  are  like  those  on  an  ac- 
tual production.  There  is  a  continuous  story, 
so  the  actors  have  every  opportunity  to  give 
natural,  intelligent  performances. 

Rehearsals  over,  the  important  day  arrives. 
On  that  one  day,  in  two  sessions,  morning  and 
afternoon,  the  complete  test  is  shot,  scene  by 
scene.  Each  actor  has  his  chance  to  take  the 
center  of  the  stage,  to  get  the  close-ups,  to 
benefit  from  the  director's  full  attention,  with 
the  other  actors  merely  feeding  lines. 

Sometimes  the  novice  forgets  that  when  she 
hasn't  the  center  of  the  stage  she  is  still  a  vital 
part  of  the  scene.  During  a  recent  test  sketch 
in  which  two  men  and  a  girl  figured,  a  sequence 
called  for  dialogue  between  the  men,  one  of 
whom  sat  next  to  the  girl  at  a  small  table  while 
the  other  man  stood  facing  them  both.  The 
girl,  not  being  included  in  the  dialogue,  sat  by 
as  indifferently  as  if  she  had  nothing  to  do 
with  the  story,  instead  of  showing  by  her  ex- 
pressions the  emotions  the  dialogue  aroused  in 
her. 

Time  and  time  again  the  director  had  to  re- 
mind her  that  she  was  a  part  of  that  scene,  in 
spite  of  the  fact  that  she  had  no  lines.  Only 
at  the  end,  when  she  spoke  a  single  line,  did  her 
face  thaw  out.  Without  voice,  she  was  as  im- 
mobile as  the  studio  dummy  who  is  thrown 
over  the  cliff  in  the  long-shots! 

T  ET'S  suppose  the  applicant  has  passed  the 
-'-'test.  Let's  suppose  she  has  been  signed  at  a 
weekly  salary  that  may  be  as  low  as  $50,  if  she 
has  had  no  previous  experience,  and  as  high 
as  $400  or  $500  if  she  is  cast  immediately  in 
an  important  role,  as  Jimmie  Dunn  was.  (Of 
course,  for  a  prominent  stage  player,  the  figure 
will  be  much  higher.)  The  contract  may  be 
drawn  up  for  three  months,  for  six  months,  or 
for  a  year,  with  various  option  periods  and 
salary  increases. 

She  is  sent  out  to  the  West  Coast  (if  hers 
was  an  Eastern  test).  Like  Robert  Montgom- 
ery, who  was  signed  by  M-G-M,  she  may  hang 
around  the  lot  for  months  without  being  as- 
signed definitely  even  to  a  minor  role.  Bob 
loafed  for  six  months,  getting  more  discour-

The  reward  of  a  successful  screen  test.  Marion  Burns,  born  and  brought 
up  in  Hollywood,  was  "discovered"  3,000  miles  from  filmland — on  a  New 
York  stage — and  given  an  Eastern  test.  She  was  cast  with  Joan  Bennett 
in  the  Fox  picture,  "Pier  13,"  and  her  next  will  be  filmed  in  far-off  Malay 


Deep  in  your  eyes,  regardless  of  their 
color,  shape,  or  size,  is  great  potential 
beauty.  Dark,  long-appearing,  luxuriant 
lashes  are  needed  to  bring  out  this  hidden 
charm — the  lure  of  lovely  lashes  that 
may  be  yours  instantly  with  a  few  simple 
brush  strokes  of  the  New  Maybelline. 
Applied  with  pure  water  and  the  dainty 
Maybelline  brush,  its  magic  touch  will 
transform  your  lashes  into  the  appearance 
of  glossy,  dark,  curling  fringe. 

This  marvelous  preparation  gives  the 
very  young  woman  the  smart  attractive- 
ness she  so  much  desires.  And  for  the 
woman  over  thirty-five,  it  instantly  erases 
at  least  ten  years.  Try  it! 

The  New  Maybelline  eyelash  darkener 
is  not  a  dye.  It  is  absolutely  harmless, 
ideally  tearproof,  and  will  not  smart  the 
eyes.  Its  constant  use  keeps  the  lashes 
soft  and  silky  and  actually  tends  to  stimu- 
late their  growth. 

Truly,  a  real  treat  will  be  yours  when 
you  discover  what  the  New  Maybelline 
can  do  to  awaken  the  sleeping  beauty  in 
your  eyes. 

Be  sure  you  get  the  genuine  NEW  Maybelline.

aged  and  dissatisfied  every  day,  until  he  was 
finally  lent  to  United  Artists  for  "Three  Live 
Ghosts,"  in  which  he  had  played  on  the  stage. 
His  success  in  that  picture  made  his  own  com- 
pany realize  his  screen  possibilities. 

■L-TKLKX  TWF.I.VETREES,  Sylvia  Sidney 
■*■  ■*■(  with  excellent  stage  experience )  and 
Dorothy  Jordan  are  among  the  hundreds  of 
tiirls  who  were  dropped  by  the  studio  that 
first  signed  them,  after  successful  tests,  simply 
because  they  had  not  had  sufficient  time  to 
develop  and  prove  their  worth. 

Each  made  good  with  a  second  chance  at 
another  studio.  But  so  many  girls  never  get 
that  second  chance. 

And  not  all  tests  are  as  fair  to  the  actress 
and  as  sure.  Some  directors  simply  pose  a  girl 
in  front  of  a  black  "drop, "  give  her  some  frag- 
mentary scene  to  enact  with  or  without  the  help 
of  other  actors,  and  without  any  additional 
coaching  expect  her  to  prove  her  value  to  the 
powers  that  pay. 

Once  cast  in  a  role  in  an  actual  production, 
the  actress  must  be  able  to  hold  her  own  against 
the  scene  stealing  of  veteran  players;  she  must 
snap  into  her  scenes  without  too  much  special 
coaching;  she  must  not  betray  inexperience  or 
camera  fright. 

She  must  have,  above  all  things,  endless  am- 
bition and  unswerving  persistence.  She  must 
believe  in  herself,  believe  even  when  the  direc- 
tor decries  her,  when  she  fails  to  get  the  roles 
she  seems  most  fitted  for. 

And  she  must  go  on  believing,  even  through 
long  periods  when  there  may  seem  no  basis  for 
such  belief. 

But  if  she  stays  around  Hollywood  too  long, 
waiting  and  waiting  for  her  chance,  she  is  apt 
to  be  permanently  overlooked. 

"HPHERE    is    more   undeveloped    talent   in 
■*•  Hollywood  than  any  other  place  in  the 
world,"  says  one  director. 

'Many  of  the  girls  have  had  excellent  stage 
experience.  Some  have  played  extra  roles  in 
pictures.  Some  have  played  bits.  But  pro- 
ducers overlook  these  girls  because  they  are 
so  used  to  seeing  them  around  and  are  no 
longer  struck  with  their  appearance  or  ability. 
Newcomers  with  half  their  possibilities  often 
get  all  the  opportunities." 

That  job  behind  a  counter  or  at  the  type- 
writer doesn't  seem  so  hard  and  unsatisfying 
after  reading  all  this,  now  does  it!

Careful  there,  Harry!  She's  trying  her  best  to  vamp 
you.  It's  a  scene  from  Harry  Langdon's  new  picture, 
"The  Big  Flash."     The  beautiful  lady  is  Lita   Chevret 


THE  BIG  FLASH 

Educational-Mermaid 
Harry  Langdon's  comeback  picture,  and  he 
gives  you  plenty  of  laughs.  Promoted  from 
office  porter  to  newspaper  photographer, 
Harry  is  sent  to  get  pictures  of  a  gangster's 
girl.  What  the  girl  and  Harry  get,  when  the 
gangster  finds  them,  is  worth  seeing.  Tipped 
off  to  a  robbery  that  is  planned,  Harry  is  off 
to  get  pictures  of  that,  too.  He  gets  the  pic- 
tures, the  gangster  and  the  reward. 

MOVIE  ALBUM 

Vitaphone 
Back  to  the  strong  but  silent  days  of  the 
movies  when  matinee  idols  saved  the  girl  from 
worse  than  death!  You  used  to  pay  a  nickel 
for  such  thrills,  but  now  you'll  howl  merrily. 
The  best  surprise  in  this  series  of  flashbacks 
is  none  other  than  Marie  Dressier  cutting  up 
in  one  of  her  old  slapstick  comedies. 

OLD  NEW  YORK 
Educational 
One  of  the  funniest  pictures  ever  made  of 
little  old  New  York  in  the  horse-car  days. 
Johnny  Walker,  star  of  silent  pictures,  ar- 
ranged this  series  of  shots  taken  when  women 
wore  flower-garden  hats  and  men  wore  mus- 
taches. What  laughs  you  will  get  when  you 
see  the  Stock  Exchange  and  the  Bowery,  but 
the  best  of  all  is  a  prize-fight  at  Coney  Island. 
Kidding  comments  make  this  a  real  gloom- 
chaser. 

SHERLOCK'S  HOME 
Vitaphone 
Jack  Haley,  graduating  from  a  detective 
correspondence  course,  is  out  to  detect.  While 
he  is  taking  a  blindfold  cigarette  test,  the  safe 
is  robbed.  Jack  discovers  where  the  crooks 
bang  out  and  disguised  as  a  girl,  vamps  their 
leader.  The  marriage  ceremony  on  the  back 
of  a  patrol  wagon  is  a  riot. 

HEMSTITCHED 
Universal 

Gangsters  need  a  doctor.     They  kidnap  a 
man,  wearing  a  doctor's  coat,  from  a  doctor's 


office.  He  happens  to  be  a  gardener  mas- 
querading. With  the  help  of  a  pretty  nurse  he 
operates.  Hence — hemstitched.  There  are  a 
few  good  laughs  and  June  Clyde  never  looked 
prettier.

Laurel  and  Hardy  are  being  deported  out  of 
town  by  a  judge  who  has  found  them  guilty  of 
vagrancy.  They  are  put  up  for  the  night  by  a 
drunk  whom  they  have  helped  home.  Whose 
house  do  you  suppose  they  find  themselves  in? 
Plenty  of  roughhouse.

DA  Y PARTY 

Educational-Terr  ytoon 
Our  animated  friends  throw  a  birthday 
party  for  Farmer  Al  Falfa  and  if  you  go  you'll 
have  a  grand  time.  What  a  party!  They  even 
make  the  birthday  cake  while  you  wait.  Try 
the  recipe  sometime. 

OFFICER,  SA  VE  MY  CHILD 
Universal 

Slim  Summerville  and  Eddie  Gribbon,  a 
couple  of  marines,  end  up  as  policemen  whin 
the  llat-foots  go  on  strike.  And  the  ever- 
lasting grudge  between  the  bugler  and  the 
sergeant  is  continued.  Isn't  it  about  time 
they  settled  it? 

THE  PIE  COVERED  WAGON 

Educational 
The  kiddies  take  you  back  to  the  covered 
wagon  days  with  Indians  and  warfare.  When 
the  Indians  attack,  a  call  for  help  is  rushed 
through  to  the  troops.  The  battle  is  on  with 
arrows  and  pie  flying  through  the  air.  Are  the 
Indians  surprised?     See  for  yourself. 

MICKEY'S  GOLDEN  RULE 
Radio 

Mickey  (Himself)  McGuire  brings  you  this 
with  plenty  of  laughs.  It  has  young  urchins 
on  a  picnic  and  the  experiences  they  have 
when  they  encounter  a  trio  from  wealthy 
families.     Don't  miss  Mickey  in  this.

COCKTAIL

akes! 


What,  no  sauce  for  your  meat,  no 
seasoning  for  your  salad?  By 
Gad,  suh,  then  flavor's  gone,  so 
necessary  to  really  enjoy  the  good 
things  we  eat. 

There's  the  reason  why  plain  to- 
mato juice  is  so  woefully  lacking 
in  appeal.  Insist  on  College  Inn 
Tomato  Juice  Cocktail,  and  you 
get  flavor;  a  zestful  tang  that  marks 
the  thorough-bred  favorite. 

One  taste  tells  why  we  call  it  To- 
mato Cocktail;  one  taste  proves 
College  Inn  is  surely  more  than 
mere  tomato  juice!  Full-flavored, 
full-bodied,  full  of  vitamins — 
yours  for  a  better  tomato  drink !

The    Third    Girl 


A 


mid  the  gayety  of  prepara- 
tions for  the  Christmas 


season  won't  you  pause  a  mo- 
ment to  pity  the  "third  girl"? 
Among  all  young  women  who 
die  between  the  ages  of  15  and 
30  one  out  of  three  dies  of  tu- 
berculosis—  a  human  sacrifice 
to  ignorance  and  indifference. 
Tuberculosis  is  preventable  and 
curable.  Turn  your  pity  into 
action  and  buy  Christmas  Seals. 
Your  pennies  help  spread  the 
knowledge  that  will  save  lives.

Brief  Reviews  of 
Current  Pictures 

l  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  16  ] 


•     STATE'S  ATTORNEY  —  Radio  Pictures.  — 
Obviously  built  for  John  Barrymore — but  how 
he  plays  the  part  I    Helen  Twelvetrees  is  good.  (July) 

STRANGE  CASE  OF  CLARA  DEANE.  THE— 

Paramount. — A  strong  picture,  but  so  similar  to  "The 
Sin  of  Madelon  Claudet"  that  it  detracts  from  its 
punch.  Cora  Sue  Collins  looms  up  as  one  of  the  few 
great  child  performers.  Frances  Dee  and  Dudley 
Digges  lend  strength  to  the  story.      (June) 

•  STRANGE  INTERLUDE— M-G-M  —  From 
a  technical  standpoint — the  most  daring  picture 
ever  produced.  Imagine  Eugene  O'Neill's  analytical 
play  in  movies!  The  utterance  of  unspoken  thoughts 
makes  the  film  both  novel  and  interesting.  Norma 
Shearer  and  Clark  Gable  astonishingly  good.    (Sept.) 

STRANGE  JUSTICE  —  RKO-Radio.  —  Story 
doesn't  ring  true,  but  excellently  directed  and  well 
acted.  About  a  Broadway  play  boy.  a  hat  check  girl 
and  a  chauffeur.     {Nov.) 

•  STRANGE  LOVE  OF  MOLLY  LOUVAIN, 
THE — First  National. — Suspense,  humor  and 
heart  interest  adroitly  shaken  together.  Intriguing 
plot.  Ann  Dvorak  and  Lee  Tracy  do  a  swell  job. 
(June) 

STRANGER    IN    TOWN  —  Warners.  —  When 
you've  seen   Chic   Sale  in  one  picture,  you've 
him  in  all.     If  you  liked  the  others,  you'll  like  this. 
(Aug.) 

STRANGERS  OF  THE  EVENING— Tiffany 
Prod. — Rip-roaring  comedy  combined  with  lots  of 
mystery  and  shudders.     (July) 

STREET  OF  WOMEN  —  Warners.  —  Roland 
Young's  sprightly  acting  saves  this  story  from  gloom. 
Kay  Francis  is  splendid.     (July) 

•  SUCCESSFUL  CALAMITY,  A— Warners  — 
Not  the  greatest  George  Arliss  picture,  but  dis- 
tinctly worthwhile.  About  the  problems  of  a  modern 
family.     (July) 

•  SYMPHONY  OF  SIX  MILLION— Radio 
Pictures. — A  beautifully  told  story  of  love  and 
service  for  all  the  family  to  see.  Ricardo  Cortez  is  a 
doctor  in  the  tenement  district,  and  Irene  Dunne  a 
crippled  girl  who  devotes  her  time  to  blind  children. 
(June) 

TENDERFOOT,  THE— First  National— Joe  E. 
Brown  as  a  cowboy  from  Texas  hits  Broadway,  and 
the  laughs  begin.    Weak  story,  but  funny  gags.  (July) 

TEXAS  BAD  MAN.  THE— Universal.— Tom 
Mix  impersonates  a  desperado  to  trap  the  bandits. 
(Aug.) 

THEFT  OF  THE  MONA  LISA.  THE— Tobis.— 

Love  story  of  an  Italian  lad.  German  drama  with 
few  English  titles,  making  the  picture  lack  interest 
for  those  who  do  not  understand  German.     (June) 

THE  STOKER— First  Division-Allied.— Even  the 
American  Marines  get  into  this  melodramatic  jumble. 
Pretty  poor  stuff.     (Sept.) 

THEY  CALL  IT  SIN— First  National.— Loretta 
Young  lovely  as  the  church  organist  who  falls  in 
love  with  the  city  boy  (David  Manners).  George 
Brent  and  Una  Merkel  help  make  this  entertaining. 
(Xov.) 

THEY  NEVER  COME  BACK— First  Division- 
Artclass. — A  dull  story  of  a  prize-fighter  and  a  night 
club  performer.  Regis  Toomey  and  Dorothy 
Sebastian.      (Aug.) 

THIRTEENTH  GUEST,  THE— First  Division- 
Monogram. — A  thrilling  murder  mystery,  with 
bright  dialogue  and  comedy  to  offset  the  horror. 
{Nov.) 

THIRTEEN  WOMEN  —  RKO-Radio.  —  Mental 
suggestion,  with  fantastic  results,  is  the  brand-new 
theme  of  this  gripping  picture.  Myrna  Loy  (who 
plavs  a  Hindu  girl  magnificently),  Irene  Dunne  and 
Ricardo  Cortez.     (Oct.) 

•  THIS  IS  THE  NIGHT— Paramount— This  is 
a  light  and  farcical  interlude  that  movie-goers 
long  for.  Lilv  Damita  is  charming  as  is  Thelma 
Todd.  Roland  Young  and  Charles  Ruggles  are  mar- 
velous comedians.    (June) 

THOSE  WE  LOVE— World  Wide.— Slow  moving 
story  about  a  novelist,  his  self-sacrificing  wife  and 
the  other  woman.  Lilyan  Tashman.  Mary  Aator 
and  Kenneth  MacKenna.     (Nov.) 

THRILL  OF  YOUTH.  THE— First  Division- 
Invincible. — About  a  voung  couple  and  an  older  pair 
who   finally   find   their   way   to    happiness.     (.Yot.) 

THUNDER  BELOW  —  Paramount.  —  Tallulah 
Bankhead  emerges  from  melodramatic  plot  as  an 
actress  of  distinction.  Paul  Lukas.  Ralph  Forbes  and 
Charles  Bickford.     (July) 


Photoplay  Magazine  for  December,  1932 


129 


•  TIGER  SHARK— First  National.— An  excit- 
ing adventure  picture.  Edward  G.  Robinson  is 
great,  and  Zita  Johann  brings  a  new  type  of  shady 
dame  to  the  screen.     (Oct.) 

*TOM  BROWN  OF  CULVER  —  Universal.  — 
All  the  action  takes  place  at  Culver  Military 
Aeademv.  A  swell  picture  for  the  whole  family  to 
see.     (Sept.) 

TRAPEZE — Harmonie-Film. — A  story  of  circu* 
life,  with  German  dialogue,  English  captions  and  ex- 
cellent acting  by  Anna  Sten.     (July) 

,        TRIAL  OF  VIVIENNE  WARE,  THE— Fox.— 

^  A  fine  balance  of  drama  and  humor.  Joan 
Bennett  plays  a  lovely  prisoner  accused  of  murder. 
Donald  Cook,  her  attorney,  will  cause  a  flutter  among 
feminine  movie-goers.  But  the  laughs  go  to  ZaSu 
Pitts  and  Skeets  Gallagher.      (June) 

TWO  AGAINST  THE  WORLD— Warners- 
Weak  story,  but  Constance  Bennett  looks  pretty  and 
does  good  work  in  a  shallow  role.  Neil  Hamilton  and 
Allen  Vincent  are  the  boys.     (Oct.) 

TWO  FISTED  LAW— Columbia.— Tim  McCoy 
Western  in  which  another  villain  forecloses  the 
mortgage  on  the  old  ranch.    Heh-heh!      (Aug.) 

•  TWO  SECONDS— First  National.— If  you 
don't  like  your  drama  full  measure,  don't  see 
this.  The  story  of  what  passes  through  a  man's  mind 
in  the  last  two  seconds  he  is  conscious  before  electro- 
cution. Edward  Robinson's  work  is  memorable  and 
the  beauty  of  Vivienne  Osborne  impressive.      (June) 

UNASHAMED— M-G-M.—  Lewis  Stone  tries  hard 
to  save  this  unbelievable  story,  but  doesn't  quite. 
Helen  Twelvetrees  and  Robert  Young.     (Sept.) 

UNHOLY  LOVE— First  Division-Allied.— Based 
on  Flaubert's  "Madame  Bovary."  Neither  very  im- 
portant nor  very  entertaining.     (Oct.) 

VANISHING  FRONTIER,  THE— Paramount. 
— You'll  like  Johnny  Mack  Brown  with  a  Spanish 
accent  as  the  hold-up  man  in  this  story  of  early 
California.     (Sept.) 

WAR   CORRESPONDENT  —  Columbia.— Jack 

Holt,  Ralph  Graves  and  Lila  Lee  in  a  stirring  story  of 
activities  on  the  Chinese  battle  front.     (Oct.) 

•  WASHINGTON  MASQUERADE.  THE  — 
M-G-M.— Washington— politics— Lionel  Barry- 
more  as  the  respected  attorney  who  goes  wrong,  and 
Karen  Morley  as  the  scheming  vamp.  A  grand 
picture.  (Sept.) 

•  WASHINGTON  MERRY-GO-ROUND  — 
Columbia. — Lee  Tracy  plays  a  young  congress- 
man who  goes  to  Washington  on  purchased  votes, 
and  then  tries  to  double-cross  the  gang  in  the  interests 
of  his  country.     A  fine  cast  in  an  exciting  film.  (Nov.) 

WEEK-END  MARRIAGE— First  National- 
Wives,  it  seems  from  this,  shouldn't  work  and 
Loretta  Young  and  Norman  Foster  explain  it  all  in 
this  earnest  picture.     (Aug.) 

WEEK   ENDS    ONLY— Fox.— Not  new  in   plot, 

but  camouflaged  with  bright  tinsel.  Joan  Bennett 
does  well  as  a  rich  girl  made  poor  by  the  stock  market 
crash.     (Aug.) 

WESTWARD  PASSAGE  —  RKO-Pathe.  —  Ann 
Harding,  ZaSu  Pitts  and  Irving  Pichel.  The  story  is 
entertaining  enough  but  it  lacks  pep  and  punch. 
(Aug.) 

•  WHAT  PRICE  HOLLYWOOD  —  RKO- 
Pathe. — Fast  and  fascinating  entertainment 
and  all  very  true  to  Hollywood.  Constance  Bennett 
gives  her  finest  performance.  Lowell  Sherman  is 
great.     (A  ug.) 

WHEN  A  FELLER  NEEDS  A  FRIEND— M-G- 

M. — The  fine  acting  of  Jackie  Cooper  and  Chic  Sale 
furnish  such  a  delicious  frosting,  you  forget  the  cake 
is  a  bit  soggy.    Full  of  humor  and  pathos.     (June) 

WHILE  PARIS  SLEEPS— Fox.— A  rip-snorting 
mellerdrammer  of  Parisian  life  through  a  Hollywood 
spyglass.      (Aug.) 

WHITE  ZOMBIE— United  Artists.— An  utterly 
fantastic  tale  about  the  half-dead,  known  as  zombies, 
who  rise  from  their  graves.  Madge  Bellamy  and 
Be!a  Lugosi.  And  vou  don't  need  to  bother  seeing  it. 
(Sept.) 

•    WINNER  TAKE  ALL— Warners.-One  o*  the 
fastest,  laugh-provoking  pictures  on  the  screen. 
Jimmy  Cagney  is  great.     Don't  miss  it.     (July) 

WOMAN  IN  ROOM  13,  THE— Fox.— Wives, 
sweethearts  and  careers.  Elissa  Landi  gives  a  strong 
performance  in  a  weak  story.     (July) 

WORLD  AND  THE  FLESH,  THE— Paramount. 
— Against  a  Russian  background  are  set  George  Ban- 
croft and  Miriam  Hopkins.     Mild.     (July) 

WYOMING  WHIRLWIND,  THE— Willis  Kent 
Prod. — A  Lane  Chandler  Western.    (July) 

•  YOUNG  AMERICA— Fox.— This  is  about 
those  youngsters  who  get  the  reputation  for 
being  the  "worst  kids  in  town."  Raymond  Borzage 
steals  the  show.  Doris  Kenyon  has  never  been  love- 
lier, and  Spencer  Tracy  and  Ralph  Bellamy  do  grand 
work.     (June)

wind  machines  to  scatter.  When  those  folks 
got  home — 

But  they  spared  the  ladies.  Clark  Gable 
and  Lewis  Stone  were  on  hand,  but  Jean 
Harlow  and  Mary  Astor  were  basking  in 
cleanliness  at  home. 

They  didn't  escape  the  rain,  however.  It 
rained  for  eighteen  days  without  stopping  on 
the  stage  at  Metro  where  they  were  shooting 
Clark's  torrid  love  affair  with  Mary. 


the   latest   quip   on 
growing     quickies. 


They'll  never  let  him  be  himself,  this  Boris  Karloff  chap.  As  the  monster 
in  "Frankenstein,"  he  got  a  grand  start  in  weird  roles.  Here  he  is  being 
made  up  for  the  part  of  Fix  Manchu,  and  the  cameraman  is  scrutinizing  the 
result  with  the  "blue  glass"  to  make  sure  it  will  pass  the  lens'  keen  eye 


TF  the  rumors  of  the  little  difficulties  of  Carole 
and  Bill  Powell  were  true,  they  must  have 
been  smoothed  over. 

Carole  had  to  work  all  night  recently.  Bill 
was  not  on  a  picture.  Bill  went  to  the  set  and 
spent  the  entire  night  so  his  wife  wouldn't  be 
lonesome  between  scenes.  And  husbands  who 
are  quarreling  with  their  wives  don't  do  that. 

A  GROUP  of  friends  were  discuss- 
■*^  ing  a  flop  made  by  a  famous 
comedian. 

"Bet  the  poor  guy  feels  ashamed 
of  it,"  one  remarked. 

"Ashamed,"  another  said,  "why 
the  only  time  he  holds  up  his  head  is 
when  he  gargles." 

Y\  XE  all  know  how  ill  Joe  E.  Brown  has 
been  and  we're  all  glad  he's  well  enough 
to  be  back  in  a  picture.  But  what  nobody 
knows  is  that  Joe  is  making  that  swimming 
yarn  with  a  brace  on  his  back.  It'll  be  there 
for  at  least  six  months.  They  can't  get  a 
double  for  Joe.  That  mouth,  you  know.  So 
Joe  is  making  those  scenes  in  the  water  (it's 
supposed  to  be  a  swimming  race  from  Los 
Angeles  to  Catalina  Island)  himself — carrying 
his  back-brace  right  along  with  him! 

T  OTJISE  CARTER,  character  ac- 
tress, was  bemoaning  her  fate  in 
pictures  playing  one  mother  role 
after  another.  "Always  a  mother," 
she  moaned,  "and  never  a  bride." 

TF  you  wanted  a  truly  tough  day  you  should 
have   gone   with    the   "Red    Dust"   location 

into  Laurel  Canyon. 

They  had  twelve  wind  machines  going  at 


once.  But  not  for  wind.  Dust!  Men  stood 
on  parallels  above  the  machines  and  threw 
shovels  of  black,  dry  dirt  into  the  air  for  the 


AND  here's 
"^^those  fast 
Seems  an  actor  was  called  to  one  of 
the  smaller  studios  for  a  part.  His 
agent  phoned  about  it.  "Sorry,"  the 
studio  replied,  "but  we  can't  use  him. 
He  doesn't  fit  the  uniform." 

TT  looks  as  if  that  Nancy  Lyon-Harry 
Bannister  affair  is  not  just  a  publicity  blurb, 
after  all.  For  Nancy  is  leaving  for  London 
and  making  no  bones  about  stating  that 
Harry  Bannister  is  awaiting  her  there. 

While  Alexander  Kirkland,  who  made  such 
a  hit  in  "Strange  Interlude,"  is  phoning  a 
New  York  divorcee  every  night.  And  when 
her  decree  becomes  final,  it's  wedding  bells 
for  Alex.  So  you  see,  that  rumor  about  Ann 
Harding  and  Alex  was  false.  Merely  old 
friends,  tried  and  true. 

T3ERHAPS  Laurel  and  Hardy's  next  feature 
picture  will  be  filmed  in  Paris.  A  French 
company  has  asked  Stan  and  Oliver  to  name 
their  price  for  a  two  version  comedy,  French 
and  English.  Even  if  the  sum  is  as  large  as 
the  national  debt,  they  guarantee  to  meet  it. 


You'll  see  that  honest  Scotchman,  Ernest  Torrence,  in  the  arch  criminal 
role  of  Moriarty,  in  the  Fox  film,  "Sherlock  Holmes."  Isn't  this  an  inter- 
esting camera  study  of  Director  Howard  and  Torrence  as  he  intently 
reads  the  lengthy  script  of  his  part  just  before  the  cameras  are  turned  on?
