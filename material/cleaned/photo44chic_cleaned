There's  only  one  thing  your  severest  critic — that's  me! — could  possibly  find  wrong  with  you.   mother  :  And  that  is  .  .  .  ?   marcia:  You  have  quite  nice  teeth,  darling.  But  they  look  as  if  they'd  been  associating  with  a  London  fog.  They  don't  shine  out  any  more  and  make  people  say,  "Oh,  what  a  be-eauti-  ful  lady!"  I'll  bet  my  last  fifteen  cents  that  you  have  "pink  tooth  brush."   mother  :  My  gums  do  bleed  a  little.  Should  I  get  all  upset  about  it  ?   marcia:  Well — it  has  never  yet  helped  anybody  have  swell-looking  teeth!  And  suppose  you  get  some  horrid  gum  trouble  like  gingivitis.  Or  Vincent's  disease.  Or  pyorrhea,  even.  Or  find  that  some  good  teeth  are  actually  in  danger.   mother  :  Very  well.  I'll  start  using  Ipana,  as  my  erudite  daughter  does.   marcia:  And  every  time  you  clean  your  teeth,  put  a  little  bit  more  Ipana  on  your  brush  and  massage  it  right  into  your  touchy  gums.  See  how  grand  and  hard  my  gums  are?   mother  :  Your  teeth  look  nice  and  bright.   marcia:  Ipana  has  ziratol  in  it.  The  food  we  eat  nowadays  is  too  soft  to  keep  the  gums  firm — but  Ipana  and  massage  keep  your  gums  firm  anyway.  So  you  use  Ipana.

"Red  Dust"  pleased  the  lovers  of  melodramatic  realism  and  put  Clark  Gable  among  the  movie  heroes  of  the  month.  A  Jean  Harlow  enthusiast  sees  in  her  an  actress  capable  of  big  parts.  Gable  got  the  plaudits  of  co-eds  seeing  the  film  en  masse.  Do  they  like  'em  rough?    THE  $25  LETTER   Panning  the  movies  has  become  a  national  pastime.  I'm  sick  of  the  people  who  think  that  a  sneer  aimed  with  alleged  scintillating  wit  at  Hollywood  is  clever  and  smart.   I  agree  that  there  is  still  a  vast  quantity  of  third-rate  stuff  emanating  from  the  film  studios.  But  isn't  that  true  of  books,  music,  painting,  the  theater  or  any  form  of  creative  expression?   Anyone  capable  of  functioning  mentally  be-  yond that  naive  but  odious  period  of  juvenilia  characterized  by  facetiousness  and  the  wise-  crack realizes  that  motion  pictures  have  pro-  gressed in  the  last  year  as  never  before.  They  have  become  a  definite  cultural  influence.   K.  J.  Howard,  Portland,  Ore.   THE  $10  LETTER   Don't  go  it  blind  when  seeing  shows.  We  used  definite  differentiation  when  the  stage  was  the  popular  medium  of  entertainment — prob-  lem plays  and  musical  comedies  were  two  different  things.  Janet  Gaynor  pictures  and  Bela  Lugosi  horrors  are  different,  too.   Don't  take  friends'  recommendations  or  criticisms  as  infallible.  Probably  you  wouldn't  wear  hats  they  chose  or  eat  dinners  they  ordered,  on  a  bet.  Why  allow  them  to  in-  fluence you  into  missing  splendid  pictures  or  sitting  in  on  duds?  Photoplay  has  concise  reviews — trustworthy  tips  for  your  taste.   Chloe  B.  Ayer,  Springfield,  111.    THE  $3  LETTER   I  wonder  what  the  coming  years  will  hold  for  those  condemned  to  live  bound  to  the  common-  place. Imagination  quickens  with  the  realiza-  tion of  what  wonders  may  be  spread  before  us  poorer  mortals  by  the  glamorous  motion  pictures.   Long  as  I  live  I  can  share  with  delightful  women  and  stalwart  men  an  endless  succession  of  adventures  and  experiences  in  every  clime.   The  Arabian  lady  enthralled  her  husband-  king  for  one  thousand  and  one  nights.  Today  the  commoner  has  more  than  that  king  could  imagine.   John  F.  MacDuffee,  Portland,  Me.   ONLY  CHEERS  FOR  LA  SHEARER   "Smilin'  Through"  had  the  shining  beauty  of  moonlight  on  a  quiet  lake,  the  loveliness  of  true,  enduring  love.  A  welcome  relief  from  mystery,  murder  and  gangster  stories.  Its  sad-  ness left  no  scar.  The  acting  of  Norma  Shearer,  Fredric  March,  Leslie  Howard  and  O.  P.  Heggie  left  a  memory  of  something  brave  and  tine  in  a  world  saddened  too  much  these  days.  Mrs.  Marion  W.  Beebe,  New  Haven,  Conn.   In  "  Smilin'  Through"  Norma  Shearer  adapts  herself  to  the  role  of  sweet  young  girl  as  easily  as  she  has  played  the  sophisticate.   Elise  E.  Reeder,  Los  Angeles,  Calif.   I  nominate  "Smilin'  Through"  and  players  like  Norma  Shearer,  Fredric  March  and  Leslie  Howard  as  a  cure  for  depression  ills.  From  them  we  learn  our  petty  troubles  are  nothing.    That  love,  romance,  hopes,  dreams,  forgiveness  go  on  forever.    I'm  smilin'  through.   John  Armour,  Wichita,  Kan.   RAH!  RAH!  RAH!  GABLE!   "Red  Dust"  is  a  honey!  Clark  Gable  doesn't  let  anybody  down  for  original  interpre-  tation. The  State  College  co-eds,  at  the  same  show,  gave  him  a  great  hand.   Jean  Harlow  should  go  far.    Her  reactions  to  every  part  she  plays  are  her  own,  and  very  fine.  I  am  anxious  to  see  her  attempt  a  big  part.  Mrs.  Katharine  A.  Dunlap,   San  Diego,  Calif.   FOR  DUNNE  AND  BOLES   "Back  Street"  is  superb — beautiful.  Really,  I  can't  express  the  way  that  picture  stirred  me.  You  could  never  have  had  a  better  team  than  Irene  Dunne  and  John  Boles.   Tillie  Blen  Strauch,  Memphis,  Tenn.   Why  can't  we  have  more  of  Irene  Dunne  and  John  Boles  and  more  pictures  like  "Back  Street"?  Mrs.  William  S.  Turner,   Indianapolis,  Ind.   A  PERFECT  VOYAGE   "One  Way  Passage"  is  the  perfect  combina-  tion of  powerful,  simple  story,  sophistication,  fine  acting  and  beautiful  photography,  a  picture  with  an  appeal  to  everyone.  From  William  Powell  and  Kay  Francis  down  to  the  room  steward,  each  is  a  polished  actor.  Earle  M.  Blackmax,  Philadelphia,  Penna.    A  triple  treat  is  the  pet  comedy,  "The  Big  Broadcast,"  with  screen,  stage  and  radio  names.  Bing  Crosby  is  song  bird  and  lover  romancing  with  Leila  Hyams.  Stuart  Erwin  also  clicks.  In  its  array  of  "air"  stars  the  picture  makes  the  networks  look  sad  and  steals  a  march  on  television    W ith   IJrickbats    8c   lJo    uquets    MODEL  FOR  HUSBANDS   Rudy  Vallee  and  Mickey  Mouse  have  their  clubs.  So  has  Lewis  Stone.  We  have  to  keep  it  secret  to  avoid  the  remarks  of  husbands  and  high  school  sons  and  daughters.   This  is  our  ritual:  We  sigh;  that  is  a  tribute  to  friend  husband,  and  then  we  look  adoringly  at  a  photograph  of  Lewis  Stone.  He  is  the  glamour  of  middle  age,  a  gentleman  of  the  old  school  in  modern  guise — what  Everywoman  dreamed  her  husband  would  grow  into.   Part  of  his  charm  is  his  fastidious  taste  in   ROMANCE  inspires  most  enthu-  siasm among  moviegoers  this  month.  "Smilin'  Through"  is  by  far  the  best  loved — with  only  com-  mendation. "Back  Street"  contin-  ues a  big  favorite,  along  with  "Bird  of  Paradise,"  "A  Bill  of  Divorce-  ment" and  "One  Way  Passage."   The  comedy  choice  is  "The  Big  Broadcast"  and  "Red  Dust"  delights  the  realism  lovers.  "Rain"  is  still  an  argument-provoker.   After  Norma  Shearer,  the  highly  favored  actresses  are  Joan  Crawford,  Greta  Garbo  and  Marie  Dressier.  Katharine  Hepburn  is  rapidly  gain-  ing an  enthusiastic  following.   Fredric  March  and  Leslie  How-  ard are  the  "white  haired"  boys  of  the  moment.  John  Boles  and  Clark  Gable  have  a  grand  court.  Robert  Montgomery  still  bewitches  the  girls  and  Ramon  Novarro's  singing  charms  them.   One  reader  senses  the  quality  of  trees  in  the  work  of  her  favorites.  We're  sure  she  means  bouquets —  not  that  their  acting  is  wooden  or  nutty.    dress.  How  we  fight,  cajole  and  plead  with  our  husbands  to  attain  that  well-groomed  appear-  ance!   Mrs.  J.  P.  Arthur,  Oakland,  Calif.   ROOTING  FOR  RICARDO   Ricardo  Cortez  was  simply  superb  in  "Symphony  of  Six  Million."  Handsome,  en-  dowed with  unusual  sensitivity,  he  is  handed  the  role  of  the  detective  in  "Thirteen  Women"  in  which  for  a  brief  moment  he  holds  the  hand  of  the  lovely  Irene  Dunne.  Give  Ricardo  a  picture  worthy  of  his  talent  and  see  if  he  isn't  box  office.   Marian  Hart,  New  Haven,  Conn.   THREE  ARTS  IN  ONE   See  "  The  Big  Broadcast" !  Bing  Crosby  and  Stu  Erwin  do  the  grandest  bit  of  acting.  The  public  gets  the  full  benefit  of  radio,  stage  and  Hollywood  stars  in  one  picture.   Mrs.  M.  Dewey,  Daytona  Beach,  Fla.   CONNIE?    NO!  BETTE!   The  idea  of  comparing  Bette  Davis  with  Constance  Bennett!  I  never  could  see  any-  thing interesting  in  Constance  Bennett.  But  Bette  Davis  has  glamour — gorgeous  glamour.  Maybe  I  owe  Constance  Bennett  an  apology,  but  I  have  written  the  way  I  feel.   Lee  Norquest,  Lafayette,  Ind.   ELECTED  FILM  TROUBADOUR   In  this  demand  for  Ramon  Novarro  to  do  a  musical  picture  again  few  people  have  given  suggestions  for  plays.  Why  not  "The  Choco-  late Soldier" — and  Lily  Pons  warbling  "M\-  Hero"?   Miss  Margaret  M.  Ryan,  Chicago,  111.    The  beautiful  philosophy  and  gentle  romance  of  "One  Way  Passage"  and  the  compelling  acting  of  Kay  Francis  and  William  Powell  prompt  a  Southern  clergyman  to  characterize  the  picture  as  sermon,  poem  and  masterpiece.    Aline  MacMahon  and  Frank  McHugh  are  applauded,  too    Norma  Shearer  was  acclaimed  for  her  change  from  sophisti-  cated roles,  Leslie  Howard  gained  a  legion  of  admirers  and  "Smilin'  Through"  satisfied  film  audiences'  yearning  for  romance  in  movies.  The  picture  was  the  month's  outstanding  favorite  with   not   one    dissenting   voice    My  two  girl  friends  and  I  are  ardent  ad-  mirers of  Ramon  Novarro,  but  we  would  like  to  hear  him  sing  more  often.   We  went  to  sec  "Huddle"  and  stayed  to  hear  him  sing — twice.   Ruth  Tollman,  Toledo,  Ohio   When  first  I  saw  Ramon  Novarro  I  became  his  true  follower.  The  adding  of  voices  to  pictures  made  me  very  happy  because  my  favorite  star  has  been  able  to  stand  all  demands  of  the  microphone.  "The  Pagan"  revealed  his  golden  voice.   Stephanie  Pilati,  Vienna,  Austria   BETTE  CLICKS  IN  DIXIE   All  true  Southerners  should  see  "Cabin  in  the  Cotton,"  in  fact  everyone  from  North  or  South.  A  revelation  for  the  whole  family  to  enjoy.  Richard  Barthelmess  was  perfect  and  Bette  Davis  never  more  exquisite.   L.  T.  Roemer,  Galveston,  Texas   URGES  SMILES  FOR  TEARS   Just  because  she  can  emote  so  artistically  Tallulah  Bankhead  has  been  cast  for  every  hard  luck  role  in  repertory.  In  "Faithless"  there  are  moments  when  her  smile  reveals  her  winsome    personality.   What  couldn't  that  clever  lady  do  if  cast  in  a  sprightly  role?  Mrs.  J.  L.  O'Connell,  Washington,  D.  C.

FALSE  FACES— World  Wide.— Startling,  with  a  brand-new  idea — an  expose  of  malpractice  in  "face  lifting."

(July)   •  LIFE  BEGINS— First  National.— Unusual  story,  laid  in  a  maternity  ward  where  life  begins  and  sometimes  ends  cruelly.  Relieved  by  comedy,  nevertheless  a  serious  film,  for  adults  only.  Eric  Linden,  Aline  MacMahon  and  Loretta  Young  head  a  fine  cast.     (Oct.)   LITTLE  ORPHAN  ANNIE  — RKO-Radio.—  Mitzi  Green  is  reason  enough  for  seeing  this  picture.  Little  Buster  Phelps  runs  a  close  second  and  May  Robson  is  a  magnificent  grandma.

Film  notables  and  ex-champs.  Jack  Oakie  is  an  aspiring  palooka,  Marian  Nixon  the  slight  romantic  interest.     (Dec.)   MAEDCHEN  IN  UNIFORM— Carl  Froelich  Prod. — German  language  film  with  English  sub-  titles, about  a  Prussian  school  for  girls  and  the  effect  of  its  rigid  discipline  and  repression  on  their  emotional  lives.

Babies  undernourished  through  another  winter  may  be  handicapped  by  frail  bodies  through  life.  The  hun-  gry  father  of  a  hungry  family  is  hardly  the  man  to  seek  employment  with  persistence,  or  to  do  well  on  the  job  when  he  gets  it.   Before  you  can  save  a  man's  soul  it  is  often  neces-  sary  to  feed  his  body.  You  have  no  right  to  expect  the  civic  virtues  of  patience,  courage  and  honesty  from  starving,  freezing  men  and  women.  If  they  preserve  a  just  attitude  towards  the  laws  of  the  city  in  which  they  live,  it  is  a  miracle.   This  winter,  as  never  before,  it  is  the  duty  of  all  who  are  well-clad,  well-housed,  and  well-fed  to  help  the  less  fortunate.  The  fact  that  you  gave  last  year,  and  the  year  before,  does  not  lessen  your  responsi-  bility. The  fact  that  you  cannot  afford  a  large  con'  tribution  must  not  deter  you.  The  upturn  of  busi-  ness with  a  gradual  improvement  of  economic  con-  ditions does  not  remove  the  crisis  of  this  moment.  Emergency  appropriations  by  the  federal  govern-  ment amount  to  $300,000,000,  but  they  meet  only  half  the  increased  national  needs  for  human  relief.    The  rest  is  up  to  you!   How  will  your  dollars  be  used?  First  of  all,  they  will  feed  the  hungry,  and  relieve  the  absolute  want  of  the  unemployed.   They  will  be  used,  also,  to  take  care  of  the  sick  and  aged.  They  will  help  to  maintain  hospitals,  orphanages  and  schools.  They  will  make  possible  clinics  and  visiting  nurses.   The  dollars  you  give  are  invested  in  the  forces  of  civilization  right  in  your  community!    WELFARE    AND    RELIEF    MOBILIZATION   The  Welfare  and  relief  Mobilization  is  a  cooperative  national  pro-  gram to  reinforce  local  fund-raising  for  human  welfare  and  relief  needs.  J\(o  national  fund  is  being  raised;  each  community  is  making  provisions  for  its  own  people;  each  community  will  have  full  control  of  the  money  it  obtains.   Give  through  your  established  welfare  and  relief  organizations,  through  your  community  chest,  or  through  your  local  emergency  relief  committee.    Newton  D.

STRANGE  JUSTICE  —  RKO-Radio.  —  Story  doesn't  ring  true,  but  excellently  directed  and  well  acted.  About  a  Broadway  play  boy,  a  hat  check  girl  and  a  chauffeur.      (Nov.)

Photoplay  Magazine  for  January,  1933    What  the  Audience  Thinks   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  7  ]   MOVIE  MORALS   We  realize  the  great  influence  movies  have  on  fashions,  but  how  about  the  influence  fashions  have  on  movies?  In  the  Short  Skirt  Era,  the  flapper  movie  actress  had  her  knees  photographed  almost  as  often  as  her  face.  Now  we  have  become  more  subtle.  Changed  fashions  demand  a  more  ladylike  heroine.  She  may  not  always  be  "good,"  but  she  does  not  flaunt  her  trespasses  and,  whatever  else  she  may  be,  she  is  not  a  hoyden.   With  fashions  going  more  and  more  Vic-  torian, I  am  wondering  if  our  screenheroines'  morals  will  finally  go  Victorian,  too !  But  that  would  be  too  dull.   Lillian  Telander,  Mora,  Minn.   THE  DEAR,  DEAD  DAYS   I  saw  "The  Birth  of  a  Nation"  at  an  age  when  I  had  to  sit  on  my  father's  lap  during  the  performance.  Not  long  after,  I  saw  "Hearts  of  the  World,"  and  we  laughed  and  wept  as  only  a  Griffith  audience  could.  With  all  the  sophistication  the  talkies  have  acquired,  these  pictures  have  not  been  outdone.   There  were  others:  Darling  Marguerite  Clark  in  "Snow  White"  .  .  .  Wally  Reid,  gallant  and  young,  in  "The  Charm  School"  .  .  .  Charlie  Chaplin  in  "The  Kid"  .  .  .  Norma  and  Constance  Talmadge  .  .  .  Valen-  tino in  "The  Four  Horsemen"  and  little  Betty  Bronson  in  "Peter  Pan."   Will  our  present  idols  last  longer  than  those  veterans  have  done.  I  doubt  it.  They  pioneered  their  way  across  the  silver  screen  and  left  us  a  glorious  memory.  Let  us  drink  a  thin,  Volsteadian  toast  to  the  old  guard — God  bless  'em!   Jenne  Cannon,  Salt  Lake  City,  Utah   WHAT  MAKES  A  GOOD  MOVIE?   It  seems  to  be  the  opinion  of  certain  parties  that  any  picture  containing  a  moral  or  a  "lesson"  is  a  good  movie.  I  don't  like  the  im-  plication. And  I  believe  a  majority  of  the  movie  fans  resent  this  feeling.   After  work  they  want  to  be  entertained.  Good,  clean  entertainment  that  doesn't  leave  them  feeling  the  after-effects  of  a  sermon!   Not  that  I  think  a  picture  with  a  moral  can't,  at  the  same  time,  be  entertaining.  But  to  bring  a  day  satisfactorily  to  a  close,  the  movie  doesn't  have  to  propound  a  theory  or  teach  a  lesson.   H.  L.  Sibole,  Elvins,  Mo.   LITTLE  THINGS  THAT  COUNT   I  have  received  many  valuable  suggestions  from  movies  for  furnishing  my  apartment.  I  never  fail  to  notice  the  arrangement  of  furni-  ture, the  artistic  way  odds  and  ends  are  placed,  the  lighting  fixtures,  and  especially  the  draperies  and  the  grouping  of  pictures.   Mrs.  J.  E.  Lassiter,  Newport  News,  Va.   FIVE  QUEENS  IN  THE  DECK   I,  a  mere  man,  have  pleasant  memories  of  "The  Right  to  Love,"  "Merrily  We  Go  to  Hell,"  and  "Letty  Lynton."  Of  course,  my  next  remark  may  start  an  argument.  But  I  don't  care!  Here  are  my  favorite  five  among  screenland's  most  beautiful  girls:  Joan  Marsh,  Frances  Dee,  Irene  Dunne,  Marlene  Dietrich,  and  Maureen  O'Sullivan.

"RAIN"  PRAISE  AND  CENSURE   I  dashed  out  into  one  storm  to  see  another  and  my  desires  were  more  than  satiated  in  "Rain."  Joan  Crawford's  reactions  to  the  tropics,  void  of  artifice,  were  most  compelling.  Walter  Huston  gave  a  rendition  well  worth  remembering.   Myrtle  Bannan,  San  Francisco,  Calif.   I  was  going  to  see  "  Rain"  because  Joan  Crawford  is  my  favorite  actress.  But  I  left  disappointed.  Why?  Because  she  overacted.

I  think  the  professor's  comparison  to  alcoholic  effects  is  a  bit  unfortunate,  but  perhaps  he  had  an  eye  to  the  sensational.  Pictures  do,  of  course,  re-  lieve us  of  dull  moments  and  help  us  forget  our  troubles.  But  that  is  not  the  chief  reason  for  their  popularity.  Is  not  this  nearer  the  truth:  nothing —  except  ourselves — is  more  interesting  than  other  human  beings?   The  very  essence  of  the  motion  picture  is  human  life  and  action.   That  is  why,  whether  we  live  on  Broadway  or  Main  Street,  we  slip  inside  the  charmed  enclosure  of  the  motion  picture  theater,  for  here  illusion  is  more  real  than  reality  itself.    A  WOMAN  tried  again  and  again  without  success  to  do  a  certain  bit  for  a  scene  in  Charles  Rogers'  "The  Devil  Is  Driving. "   Director  Benjamin  Stoloff  looked  over  the  faces  of  the  extras.  He  noticed  the  anxious  eyes  of  one  of  the  five-doll  a  r-a-dayers.   "Here,  you  try  it,"  he  commanded.   The  woman  turned  on  that  scene  like  an  old-  hander.    No  wonder!   She  was  Mary  MacLaren,  one  of  Hollywood's  highest -paid  years  ago.  A  star!  She  married  and  retired  to  India.   Four  years  ago  she  returned  to  Hollywood,  divorced,  to  make  a  comeback.  Photoplay  carried  a  big  story  on  her  return  and  experiences  in  India.   This  bit  is  the  first  screen  work  she  has  done  except  as  an  extra.  Let  us  hope  it  may  lead  to  real  character  opportunities.    Photoplay  has  passed  another  milestone.  On  November  10th  fell  the  eighteenth  birthday  of  this  publication.  The  motion  picture  industry  was  hardly  more  than  an  infant  when  this  youngster,  too,  came  into  the  world,  and  they  have  grown  up  together.   Unlike,  however,  most  of  the  studio  organizations,  Photoplay's  management  and  direction  have  remain-  ed the  same.  Its  problems,  naturally,  have  not  been  as  complex  as  those  of  the  great  industry  whose  ac-  tivities it  records.  Yet,  nevertheless,  in  this  world  of  flux  and  change  Photoplay's  undeviating  continuity  is  remarkable.  Hardly  more  than  a  pamphlet  in  the  beginning,  it  early  won  leadership  in  the  field  of  motion  picture  publications  and  has  maintained  that  leadership  ever  since.    BUT  one  monster  at  a  time,"  appears  to  be  an  unwritten  tradition  of  Hollywood.  Lon  Chancy,  finding  this  position  vacant,  made  the  most  of  his  opportunity  and  a  name  for  himself  as  a  master  in-  terpreter of  fiendish  r61es.  Whoever  saw  him  in  "The  Hunchback  of  Notre  Dame"  or  in  "The  Phantom  of  the  Opera"  had  impressions  burned  into  his  memory  that  time  cannot  eradicate.   Yet  when  he  came  to  the  screen  to  play  the  part  of  a  fake  cripple  at  five  dollars  a  day  in  "The  Miracle  Man,"  the  sinister  make-up  of  his  later  famous  roles  was  missing.  It  took  time  for  him  to  discover  and  develop  that  rare  combination  of  histrionic  technique  and  mechanics  that  but  one  other  man  has  success-  fully imitated.   Boris  Karloff — is  it  coincidence? — is  now  repeating  on  the  Universal  lot  Chaney's  spectacular  career.  Yet  he  is  not  another  Chaney.  His  methods  and  effects  are  distinctly  individualistic.  Whether  his  range  will  be  as  great  as  that  of  his  distinguished  prototj'pe  time  alone  will  reveal.  Karloff's  first  notable  performance  was  the  Monster  in  "Franken-  stein," that  old  hair-raiser  of  the  early  nineteenth  century  and  a  unique  and  sensational  romance  of  its  dav.    THESE    "monster"   parts,    when   backed   by  the  right  plot,  the  right  settings  and  skillful  direction,  seem   almost   invariably  to   have   met   with   popular    success.  But  obviously  to  secure  these  effects  is  some-  thing far  more  than  a  trick.  It  is  an  art  and  true  art  is  something  that  cannot  be  mechanically  copied.   The  taste  for  the  weird  and  the  uncanny  is  perennial  in  the  human  soul.  It  is  easy  to  conceive  of  Karloff  ten  years  from  now,  when  the  names  of  other  out-  standing actors  of  the  day  shall  have  practically  been  forgotten,  still  holding  an  undisputed  eminence.   Chaney's  and  Karloff 's  names  should  go  down,  linked  together,  in  motion  picture  history.    YEARS  ago  an  obscure  newspaper  cartoonist  and  an  equally  obscure  reporter  worked  on  a  New  York  newspaper.   The  cartoonist  was  John  Barry  more;  the  reporter,  Fritz  Tidden.   You  know  where  Jack  landed.    Well,  Fritzy  manip-  ulates all  of  Clarence  Brown's  business  in  Hollywood.  And  when  Ethel  Barrymore  came  to  the  Coast  he  took  hers  over,  too.     Jack  got  his  pal  the  job  with  bis.    THOUGH  not  hedged  about  by  the  divinity  that  once  belonged  to  kings,  the  mystery  that  sur-  rounds the  great  actresses  of  the  screen  is  a  sub-  stitute that  is  almost  as  good.   With  Garbo  still  abroad,  at  this  writing,  rumors  pop  across  the  Atlantic  with  all  the  brilliance  and  plentitude  of  a  shower  of  Leonids;  she  is  going  to  appear  in  a  stage  play  in  Europe ;  she  is  going  to  take  up  her  residence  on  an  island  off  the  Spanish  coast,  they  say.  And  a  group  of  newspaper  men  in  Europe,  with  persistent  reiteration,  hint  that  the  world's  great  Swede  is  a  widow.   On  the  other  hand,  Marlene  Dietrich,  breaking  a  cautious  silence  of  many  months'  standing,  gives  an  exclusive  interview  to  Photoplay  Magazine.  A  wise  move  on  her  part,  too,  as  it  places  her  tangled  situa-  tion before  the  public  sympathetically.  And  Dietrich,  a  woman  of  unusual  intelligence  and  understanding,  chose  the  psychological  moment  to  break  her  silence.    SINCE  women  came  out  from  behind  the  mul-  tiplicity of  petticoats  and  grew  friendly  with  the  sun,  the  "milk  white  skin,"  about  which  the  poets  used  to  sing,  is  disappearing.   So  says  Busby  Berkeley,  chorus  director  of  many  of  the  dance  routines  in  motion  picture  extravaganzas.   Repeated  coats  of  sun  tan  have  given  the  average  young  American  woman  a  distinct  brownish  body  tinge.  If  sun  tan  continues  to  be  fashionable  the  whole  white  race  may  show  effects  of  it  in  a  few  generations,  to  quote  our  authority.   There  are  no  "milk  white"  examples  among  all  the  hundreds  of  chorus  girls  in  Hollywood  who  have  been  tried  out  for  Berkeley's  various  productions.   Does  this  mean  the  extinction  of  the  blonde?  It  looks  perilously  like  it.    HERE'S  one  of  the  best  Jolson  stories  to  date.  It  seems  Al  was  scheduled  to  make  a  radio  broadcast  and  just  as  he  was  about  to  go  on  the  air  he  received  a  long  distance  call  from  New  York.   "The  broadcast  was  great,"  a  pal  said  across  the  wires,    "you   were   marvelous,   Al,   just   marvelous!"   "Hey,  wait  a  minute,"  Al  shouted,  "why  I  haven't  even  made  it  yet."   There  was  a  profound  silence  from  the  other  end.   And  then  his  friend  chirped  up  brightly,  "Yeah,  but  you  forget  the  three  hours  difference  in  time,  Al.  You're  all  through  back  here."    IN  a  recent  issue  of  Motion  Picture  Herald  there  was  printed  an  interesting  analysis  of  the  basic  production  costs  for  the  year  1932  as  compared  with  the  pro-  duction budget  of  1926,  in  the  days  of  the  silents.  Today,  as  six  years  ago,  for  every  dollar  expended,  actors'  salaries  take  twenty-five  cents;  studio  and  physical  administration  costs  are  now  twenty-three  cents  against  a  former  twenty  cents;  the  amounts  invested  in  scenarios  and  stories  show  a  proportionate  increase  of  fifty  per  cent — the  1926  cost  being  ten  cents  on  a  dollar  and  the  1932,  fifteen  cents.  Directors,  cameramen  and  assistants  receive  now  thirteen  cents  in  comparison  with  the  former  ten  cents.   While  all  the  costs  are  not  here  covered,  those  mentioned  are  among  the  principal  ones.   The  increase  in  allowance  for  scenarios  is  account-  able by  the  fact. that  the  advent  of  talkies  brought  a  trend  toward  books  and  stage  plays,  for  which  a  considerable  price  or  royalty  often  has  to  be  paid.   This  increase  in  proportionate  costs,  wherever  they  occur,  must  not  be  misinterpreted.  Very  few,  if  any,  studios  spent  as  much  in  1932  for  salaries,  production  costs,  etc.,  as  they  did  in  1926.  Conservation  has  been  the  watchword  and  there  are  no  signs  that  this  trend  will  diminish,  at  least  during  the  early  months  of  1933.    A  MOST  popular  set  in  Hollywood  has  been  the  one  where  thirty-eight  old  ladies  met  daily  to  make  a  sequence  for  "R  I  Had  A  Million."   They  gathered  cozily  about,  chatting  and  knitting,  until  they  were  called.   Margaret  Mann,  who  will  be  remembered  in  "Four  Sons,"  the  Gold  Medal  picture  for  1928,  brought  pans  of  home-made  ginger  bread  for  everyone  to  sample.   One  old  lady  who  acted  the  part  of  a  blind  woman,  read  Braille  with  her  fingers.   "You  did  that  perfectly,"  the  director  said.   "I  should,"  she  replied  sweetly,  "I've  just  recovered  from  thirty  years  of  blindness. "   At  the  conclusion  of  their  sequence,  Paramount  enclosed  an  extra  fifty  dollars  in  each  pay  envelope,  and  many  an  old  lady  wept  with  gratitude,  as  that  work  was  the  first  most  of  them  had  had  in  a  year.   Kathryn  Dougherty    Scotty  Welbourne    NOT  since  Paul  Muni's  "Seven  Faces,"  has  a  film  been  given  the  interesting  background  of  a  wax  museum.  This  scene  is  from  Warners'  Technicolor  picture,  "The  Wax  Museum,"  in  which  Lionel  Atwill  plays  a  sculptor,  shown  here  putting  the  finishing  touches  on  a  wax  figure  of  "Voltaire."  Director  Curtiz  holds  the  script    £7    Is  Dietrich  Th    rou    Read  these  startling  State-  merits  as  made  by  Marlene  Dietrich  in  an  exclusive  interview,  the  first  she  has  granted  in  many  months    By  Ruth   Biery    flannel  suit  with  perfectly  tailored  trousers,  coat,  shirt  and  tie  (the  extra-wide  brim  of  her  white  hat  was  the  only  concession  to  her  femininity),  she  paced  the  floor  with  rapid,  well-balanced  and  concretely  graceful  strides.  She  smoked  one  cigarette  from  another.  She  was  nervous.  Breaking  a  protective  silence  is  not  easy  for  a  woman  as  intelligent  and,  at  the  same  time,  as  sensitive  as  Marlene  Dietrich.   I  tried  to  find  proper  words  to  describe  her  even  as  I  sat  watching  her,  but  it  was  difficult.  Dressed  like  a  man,  she  was  so  obviously  a  high-strung  woman.  Her   nervousness,   her   great   grace,    her  rapid,   high-    Suggesting  an  ascetic — pale,  mystical — Josef  Von  Sternberg  wields  a  powerful  influence  over  the  professional  life  of  Dietrich.  Will  his  retirement  mean  the  end  of  her  career?  Only  a  Euro-  pean-bred person  could  understand  this  situation    HOLLYWOOD  is  eagerly  discussing  Marlene  Dietrich  and  her  problems.  Her  contract  with  Paramount  is  finished  in  February.  Will  she  re-sign?  Will  she  make  pictures  with  other  directors  than  Von  Sternberg?  Will  she  remain  in  this  country  or  return  to  Europe  as  has  been  rumored?  That  Maurice  Chevalier  gossip?  What  was  behind  the  seeming  unfriendliness  between  herself  and  Von  Sternberg?   W'hat  was  all  that  fuss  about  the  kidnapping  of  her  daughter?     Was  this  just  another  publicity  racket?   Literally  hundreds  of  curious,  anxious  questions.   Marlene  has  not  granted  an  interview  for  seven  months.  She  has  remained  isolated  behind  her  forbidden  guard  of  nine  detectives.  Yes,  I  said  nine.  Neither  Marlene  nor  her  daughter  has  moved  without  the  protection  of  armed  guards  for  many,  many  weeks.  She  had  added  what  threatened  to  be  an  indefinite  silence  to  her  well-  managed  defense.   But  now  she  has  broken  that  silence.  "It  is  right  that  the  American  people  who  have  been  kind  enough  to  see  my  pictures  should  know  and  understand.  It  is  right  that  I,  myself,  should  tell  them."   She  paced  the  floor  of  her  simple,  yet  luxurious  dress-  ing-room suite  while  she  was  talking.   Dressed  in  a  white    Here  is  the  answer  to  that  question  which  has  kept  public  and  studios  agog    The  eternal  mother,  whose  fears  for  her  daughter's  safety  are  potent  fac-  tors in  her  desire  to  return  to  Germany    tensioned  speech  made  her  so  supremely  feminine  that  one  forgot  the  trousers.   She  was  curious  about  all  that  had  been  said  about  her.  She  had  me  repeat  the  rumors.  When  I  hesitated  at  something  which  seemed  to  me  too  cruel,  too  absurd,  she  urged  me  on.  She  laughed  merrily  as  the  gossip  mounted.  When  I  had  finished,  she  sobered.   "I  didn't  see  anyone  for  more  than  half  a  year.  I  am  stepping  out  from  that  silence  because  I  have  wanted  to  tell  the  truth.   "r"pHE  fact  is,  Mr.  Von  Sternberg  has   JL  wanted  me  to  work  with  someone  else.  It's  me  that  always  asks  him  to  make  my  pictures.  There  are  letters  which  Mr.  Schul-  berg  has  from  me  saying,  'Please  make  Mr.  Von  Sternberg  do  it.'   "Both  of  our  contracts  are  up  after  the  next  picture.  I  will  not  remain  in  Hollywood.  I  am  sure.  I  will  go  to  Paris  and  Berlin  and  London  and  sing.  I  have  some  stage  offers.  Mr.  Von  Sternberg  is  tired  of  pictures.  He  wants  to  go  to  Japan.  And  I  will  never  make  pictures  in  America  with  anvone    but  Mr.  Von  Sternberg. "   Although  Marlene  did  not  know  it,  she  was  merely  verifying  what  Josef  Von  Sternberg,  himself,  had  told  me  when  those  two  were  at  war  with  Paramount  over  the  making  of  "Blonde  Venus."   "I  am  going  to  retire.  I  had  just  so  many  stories  in  me.  I  wouldn't  be  surprised  if  I  have  to  make  'Blonde  Venus'  and  one  more  (the  terms  of  his  contract — also  Mar-  lene's)  and  then  never  make  another."    Hollywood  cannot,  of  course,  under-  stand such  an  arrangement.  A  star  of  Marlene  Dietrich's  potentialities  to  re-  tire from  the  screen  because  she  will  allow  only  one  man  to  direct  her!  A  woman  who  would  reject  all  that  money!   I  wonder  if  America  can  understand  her.  Marlene  Dietrich  is  so  ail-in-  clusively European.  And  despite  the  efficiency  of  communication  in  this  modern  era—  Europe  is  still  Europe  and  America  still  America.  Marlene's  view-  point is  wholly  theirs.  One  must  bridge  the  Atlantic  to  even  begin  to  under-  stand her.   She  tried  to  make  me  see  it.   "My  contract  could  have  gone  longer.  I  wanted  to  be  free  when  he  was  free.  I,  myself,  don't  like  making  pictures.  I  can  live  without  making  them.  I  am  not  the  movie  actress.   "I  haven't  got  to  act  to  be  happy.  I  can  be  quite  happy  without  acting.  I  know  so  many  actresses  with  that  ter-  rible desire  to  act.  They  cannot  be  hap-  py unless  the  desire  comes  out  of  them  in  acting.    limbs  that  made  the  West-  ern world  gape,  which  were  first  seen  in  "The  Blue   Angel"    I  have  other  Money  doesn't  mean    I  DON'T  have  it  at  all  duties.   "And  money,  a  thing  to  me.  "   I  asked  her  if  this  wasn't  because  her  family  has  money.  She  shrugged.  And  a  shrug  from  Marlene  Dietrich  can  be  more  expressive  than  an  entire  volume  of  words  from  another  woman.   "Yes.  We  have  money.

Bette  Davis  made  this  re-  mark immediately  after  she  had  married  a  boyhood  sweet-  heart who  knew  absolutely  nothing  about  screen  love-  making.   Bette  was  unwilling  to  risk  married  life  with  a  man  whose  very  work  called  for  him  to  make  love  to  other  women.   Many  Hollywood  women  seem  to  have  preferred  hus-  bands who  were  not  actors.  Gloria  Swanson's  first  husband  (Wallace  Beery)  was  from  the  screen,  but  her  last  three  have  been  non-professionals.   Marian  Nixon,  Constance  Talmadge,  Connie  Bennett,  Joan  Bennett,  Janet  Gaynor  and  a  host  of  others  have  chosen  men  who  are  not  actors  for  husbands.   Likewise,  Clark  Gable,  Neil  Hamilton,  Robert  Mont-  gomery and  Richard  Dix  have  non-acting  wives.   On  the  other  hand,  Lilyan  Tashman  and  Edmund  Lowe,  Joan  Crawford  and  Douglas  Fairbanks,  Jr.,  Mary  Pickford  and  Doug,  Sr.,  Clara  Bow  and  Rex  Bell,  Vilma  Banky  and  Rod  LaRocque,  and  a  long  list  of  others  are  professional,  as  well  as  personal,  partners.   WHICH  is  the  wiser  choice?  No  one  can  make  definite  answer.  The  problem  is  as  rela-  tively old  to  Hollywood  as  the  "egg  or  the  chicken  first"  is  to  the  world.  There  are  dangers  in  either  direction.  But  then,  any  matrimonial  boat  faces  rough  seas,  whether  launched  in  Hollywood  or  Des  Moines,  Iowa.  And  screen  actors  and  actresses  are  just  as  faithful  and  loyal,  as  a  class,  as  any  other  group  of  people.  Love  always  seems  to  an-  ticipate that  marriage  will  change  human  nature.  Human  nature  is  not  so  easily  changed.    Those  torrid  kisses  you  pay  to  see  at  your  local  theater  often  leave  lingering  memories  with  the  players  as  well  as  with  you    Smart  girl — Bette  Davis!  When  she  married  she  wanted  her  husband  for  keeps.  "It's  safest  to  marry  a  non-professional,"  she  reasoned,  and  so  Harmon  O.  Nelson  was  elected  to  be  the  lucky  man    If  it  were — we  would  already  have  a  Utopian  civilization  and  a  divorceless  Hollywood.   But  a  Hollywood  marriage  faces  exceptional  dangers.  If  an  actress  chooses  an  actor  she  has,  immediately,  two  possi-  bilities.    Screen  love-making  and  professional  jealousy.   The  same  is  true,  of  course,  if  an  actor  chooses  an  actress.   If  the  partner  is  non-professional — the  danger  is  in  the  opposition  of  interests.         f)         j-,         ,  .  r  •      i   Bette  Davis  may  be  faced  today  with  the       OY   hiVdllTie    LieueV   32    thought;  "Will  he  be  known  as  Mr.  Bette  Davis?"  and  more  deadly  still,  "Will  he  become  content  to  be  known  as  Mr.  Bette  Davis?"   She  preferred  that  risk  to  the  one  of  having  him  an  actor  who  would  spend  his  days  making  love  to  other  women.   I  have  said  —  you  can't  change  human  nature  by  mar-  riage. Let  us  take  this  jealousy  between  an  actress  wife  and  an  actor  husband  as  an  illustration.   ALL  actors  must  be  jealous  to  reach  the  pinnacle  of  fame.  It  is  the  great  "I  am"  within  them  which  pushes  and  propels  from  one  rung  of  the  ladder  to  another.  They  must  feel  that  they  are  better  than  the  other  fellows.  And  they  must  feel  jealous  of  the  one  who  seems  to  be  succeeding  more  rapidly.  Jealousy  is  an  ab-  solutely normal  part  of  their  egotistically  ambitious  natures.  Joan  Crawford  and  Douglas,  Jr.,  for  example,  swore  in  the  first  heat  of  that  mad  passion  which  swirled  them  away  from  life's  normal  channels  that  they  would  never  be  jealous.  They  swore  they  would  change  their  normal  actors'  natures.  I  can  remember  Joan  sitting  on  her  kitchen  sink  in  the  old  Beverly  Hills  house  and  saying,  "I  will  always  want  Dodo's  success  ahead  of  mine."  He  retaliated  in  like  manner.  Brave  words  — but  each  is  still  zealously  furthering  his  own  career.   Mary  and  Doug,  Sr.,  are  just  now  proving  that  mar-  riage has  not,  through  all  these  years,  changed  their  natures.  Doug  is  ready  to  retire  and  live  upon  the  wealth  and  the  laurels  which  pictures  have  already  brought  him.  Mary  is  not.  Marriage  has  never  been  able  to  kill  the  intense  ambition  within  her.   Actors  are  more  highly  tuned,    more   emotional    than  the   average   person.     Also   a  necessity  of  the  profession.  And  if  an  actor  is  making  love  all  day  long  to  a  beautiful  girl  as  part  of  his  profession,  can  you  expect  him  to  forget  the  moment  the  last  scene  for  the  day  is  completed?   Be  reasonable.  If  you  spent  a  day  in  Ronald  Colman's  arms,   could  you  forget  it?    Or,  if  you  are  a  man,  and  you  had  spent   eight  hours  clasping  and  unclasping,  kissing  and  un-kissing   Marbne   Dietrich — would   you   forget   it?

By  Jack  Jamison    IT  all  started  back  when  Gary  decided  to  leave  Hollywood  for  a  while  and  take  a  trip.  Some  said  he  was  sick.  Others  said  he  was  merely  tired.   He  had  a  right  to  be  tired,  heaven  knows;  he  had  turned  out  something  like  six  full-length  features  in  a  year.   But  that  does  not  matter.  Nor  does  it  matter  that  other  rumorites  claimed  that  he  was  simply  trying  to  kid  the  stu-  dio into  giving  him  a  raise —  for  when  an  actor  whose  pic-  tures are  selling  well  asks  for  a  vacation,  you  know,  the  studio  sometimes  responds  with  a  boost  in  salary  to  keep  him     before     the     cameras.   But  what  matters  is  that,  when  Gary  Cooper  walked  in-  to the  front  office  and  said,  "I'd  like  to  go  away  for  a  while,''  the  studio  promptly  came  back  with,  "Go  to  it!"   "My  doctor  says  that  I  ought  to  take  a  rest,"  Gary  explained.   "All  right.  Fine,"  they  told  him.  "  Take  a  nice  trip.  We'll  see  you  when  you  come  back."   That  last  sounded  a  bit  om-  inous. Gary's  contract  was  coming  up  soon,  for  re-sign-  ing. Why  was  the  studio  so  willing  to  let  him  leave  town?  Were  they  glad  to  get  rid  of  him?  Was  he  done?  Whispers  came  to  his  ears.   Hollywood  was  saying  that  he  was  done,  that  Paramount  was  angling  for  a  New  York  boy  named  Cary  Grant,  to  replace  him.     That  was  round  one.     And  Gary  Cooper  lost  it.   Round  two  began  when,  almost  simultaneously,  Gary  sailed  from  New  York  on  his  trip  and  Cary  Grant  arrived  in  Holly-  wood "on  an  auto  tour."  The  whisperers  began  to  feel  surer  of  themselves.  It  was  an  open  secret  that  Cooper  had  been  weakening  at  the  box-office.  Nothing  was  more  natural,  then,  than  to  suppose  that  the  studio  might  be  looking  for  another  lad.  And  Cary  Grant,  scouts  reported,  certainly  looked  likely!   IF  Paramount  were  to  put  him  under  contract,  the  suspicions  would  be  confirmed.  And,  as  you  know,  that  is  exactly  what  Paramount  did.   "Ah-h-h!"  The  "I-told-you-so's"  swelled  into  a  veritable  chorus.  It  was  noticed  instantly  that  Cary  looked  enough  like  Gary  to  be  his  brother.  He  weighed  172  pounds  to  Gary's  160,  and  he  photographed  dark  as  against  Cooper's  sandy  hair  and  blue  eyes;  but  they  are  both  tall,  lithe,  "threat  men."   "They  not  only  picked  a  man  that  looks  like  Gary,  but  they  even  picked  a  name  like  Coop's,"  the  wiseacres  observed,  pointing  out  further  that  Grant's  initials,  C.  G.,  were  Gary's    Cary  looks  enough  like  Gary  to  be  his  brother.  Both  are  tall,  they  weigh  about  the  same,  and  they  fit  the  same  sort  of  roles.     Even  their  names  are  similar!    Have  these  two  young  men  —  Gary  Cooper  (above)  and  Cary  Grant  been  matched  in  the  screen  ring,  with  the  de-  cision left  to  the  public?    reversed.  Round  two,  there  s  no  doubt  of  it,  went  to  Cary  Grant.  He  began  im-  mediately to  appear  in  ex-  actly the  same  sort  of  parts  that  had  always  been  given  to  Cooper — "This  Is  the  Night,"  for  instance,  and  "Sinners  in  the  Sun."   GARY  COOPER  was  in  Africa,  shooting  lions.  What  would  happen  when  he  came  home?     Would  the  studio  take  him  back,  with  Cary  Grant  on  the  pay-roll?  "Not  a  chance! "  said  those  who  believed  that  Gary  was  through.  But  Gary  won  round  three,  for  all  that.    For,  the  instant  he  set  foot  on  Hollywood  soil,  Paramount  signed  him  to  a  nice  new  contract.    Of  course,  he  arrived  with  a  pet  monkey  whose  name  sounded  a  lot  like  Tallulah,  thus  acquiring  for  himself  a  lot  of  splendid,  free  publicity.    That  may  have  had  something  to  do  with  it.    It  looked,  from  the  reaction  of  the  public  to  that  publicity,  as  though  theater-goers  were  still  interested  in  Coop-  er's name.   Maybe  the  studio  took  him  back  because  of  a  sudden  fear  that  he  might,  after  all,  have  too  much  appeal  to  make  it  sound  business  to  let  him  go.  That  monkey  was  a  master  touch.  Gary  had  trained  for  a  longer  time  in  the  Publicity  Gymnasium  than  Cary  Grant.  He  knew  the  ropes.  And  he  won  round  three.   And  so  round  four  started  with  both  boys  on  the  same  studio  lot — two  men  who  look  a  great  deal  alike,  and  who  fit  the  same  sort  of  parts.  No  wonder  Hollywood  is  watching  the  fight  with  bated  breath!  For  there  is  trouble  brewing  whenever  a  studio  has  the  misfortune  to  own  two  or  more  stars  who  fit  equally  well  into  one  type  of  part— as    [  please  turn  to  page  111  ]   33    Three  Ring   Circus  o    THE  stage  is  set.  The  audience  is  filing  in.  Behind  the  curtain,  prop  men,  producers,  writers,  and  actors  are  flying  madly  about.  Getting  in  each  other's  way.  It's  a  mad  confusion.  The  orchestra  steals  from  its  hiding  place  beneath  the  stage  to  the  pit.   The  theater  is  filling  fast.  Faces  of  the  actors,  some  gay,  some  sad,  are  glimpsed  here  and  there  in  the  wings.  A  last  call  for  the  players.  The  overture.  Quiet.  The  theater  is  darkened  while  the  great  spotlight  of  publicity  is  turned  on  the  stage  called  Hollywood.   A  last  "toompa  toompa"  from  the  orchestra.  A  last  breath-  less pause.  And  the  curtain  goes  up  on  "Hollywood's  Three.  Ring  Circus  of  1932.''   For  a  second  the  stage  is  empty.  In  one  corner  stands  the  gate  to  the  great  Union  Depot  through  which  the  actors  pass  and  re-pass  in  and  out  of  Hollywood.   The  three  rings  are  scat-    tered about  the  huge  stage.   The  audience  waits  tensely.   And  suddenly,  it's  on.  And  the  audience  beholds  Holly-  wood— its  Hollywood — in  the  year  1932.  Without  any  re-  gard for  time  or  dates,  the  circus  goes  on.   Amidst  the  confusion,  Jimmy  Durante  comes  hopping  in,  re-  moving cactus  from  his  anatomy.  The  desert  had  called  "  Schnozzle. "  He  removes  a  large  spine  from  his  nose  and  the  audience  yelps.     "How  mortifyin',"  Jimmy  remarks.   Jimmie  Dunn  and  his  chorus  of  girls,  Molly  O'Day,  Cecilia  Parker,  June  Knight,  Maureen  O'Sullivan  and  others,  go  into  a  quick  song  and  dance  while  Jimmie  warbles,  "What  have  I  Dunn  to  deserve  this?''  Telegraph  boys  fly  madly  in  and  out  of  the  wings  bringing  the  message  that  Gloria  Swanson  has  a  new  baby,  while  Lupe  Velez  is  seen  leaping  from  Howard  Hughes'  car  to  the  rear  end  of  the  "  Sunset  Limited"  to  go  bye-  bye  with  Jack  Gilbert.  Signs  flash  on  and  flash  off  announcing,  "It's  no  longer  Greta  Garbo,  but  just  Garbo,"  while  through  the  depot  gate  comes  a  little  gray-haired  man  who  steps  quietly    into  the  third  ring — Chaplin,  home  from  Europe.  In  the  second  ring  are  Garbo,  Beery,  Crawford,  the  Barrymores,  Lewis  Stone,  and  the  making  of  "Grand  Ho-  tel" is  on.  Suddenly  there  is  a  wild  ter-  rifying scream,  and  through  the  trees  swings  the  long,  half-naked  body  of  Johnny  Weissmulle1".  Tarzan,  and  his  call  of  the  bull  ape  echo  through  the  land  while  fifty  thousand  women  swoon  with  delight.   In  the  first  ring,  through  doors  marked  Paramount,  Radio,  Metro-Goldwyn-  Mayer,  Fox,  United  Artists,  stepped  the  producers  in  nifty  polo  pants  and  silk  hats.  They  grab  hands,  go  into  a  quick  tango,  and  join  in  their  theme  song,  "Production  costs  must  come  down  (kick  twice),  must  come  down  (dip),  must  come  down  (glide),  production  costs  must  come  down  (twirl),  but  how  in-  the'ell  can  we  do  it?"   Doug  Fairbanks  and  a  monkey  set  sail  for  the  South  Seas  on  Joe  Schenck's  yacht,  to  make  a  picture.   Now  the  actors  shrink  back  in  alarm.  The  ghastly  figure  of  Frankenstein  moves  across  the  stage  with  twenty  little  Frank-  enstein off-spring  in  its  wake.  The  Monster  had  little  monsters  and  the  reign  of  horror  pictures  is  on.   Actors,  writers,  everyone  is  racing  about  stuffing  key-holes,  pulling  shades.

He  wants  more  sugar.  The  Warner  Brothers  come  running.  "Little  boys  mustn't  have  too  much  sugar,"  they  warn,  "make  tummy  ache."  Jimmy  kicks  and  screams  the  louder.  And  won't  play.  "I'll  be  a  doctor  first,"  screams  Jimmy.  And  leaves  town.  .   THE  show  goes  on.  Snappy,  wisecracking  writers  from  New  York  arrive  in  droves  to  a  quick,  snappy  step  and  leave  two  weeks  later  doing  a  broken  arch  trot.  Song  writers  sneak  in  unnoticed.   Columnists  and  fan-writers  race  in  and  out,  in  and  out,  screaming,  "Scoop,  scoop,  we've  got  to  have  a  scoop."   The  cry  goes  up,  "Is  Garbo  leaving?  Is  Garbo  coming  back?     Is  there  a  Garbo?"   In  the  distance  can  be  heard  a  din.  It  grows  louder.  More  confusing.  And  here  they  are,  the  Four  Marx  Brothers.  Two  arrived  by  plane,  one  by  train  and  Harpo  comes  limping  in  after  a  blonde.    From  now  on  Hollywood  never  looks  the  same.   The  scene  changes.  A  beautiful  blonde  stands  alone  in  her  hilltop  home  and  waves  goodbye  forever  to  a  husband  on  his  way  to  Reno.  Ann  Harding  and  Harry  Bannister.

A  mob  gathers.

People  might  think  I  was  connected  with  the  moving  picture  business,"  said  Mr.  Marx  roll-  ing his  eyes  and  his  cigar  simultaneously.   A  T  a  movie  the  other  night  a  fan  rushed  up  *-to  Aileen  Pringle  and  said,  "  I  saw  you  in  the  picture  tonight.  "  "Sonny,"   Aileen   replied,    "your  eyesight  must  be  wonderful. "   ■\X7LLL  ROGERS  was  playing  with  his  well-known  rope  one  day  during  the  making  of  "Too  Busy  To  Work"when  Floyd  Gibbons  unexpect-  edly walked  onto  the  set.   "I  see  you're  keeping  in  practice,  Will."   "That's  just  it,"  Rogers  shifted  his  gum.  "You  never  can  tell  in  these  times  how  soon  you'll  have  to  pick  up  the  old  routine."   •"THREE  months  makes  a  lot  of  difference  sometimes,  and  even  studios  slip  up  on  dates.  Paramount,  thinking  that  Nancy  Car-  roll's contract  expired  February  next,  put  her  in  a  picture;  imagine  their  embarrassment  when  Nancy  convinced   them   that  she  was    actually  through  in  November.  They  had  to  have  her  finish  the  film,  of  course — and  didn't  little  Nancy  make  them  pay  through  the  nose!   CIX  years  ago,  Charles  Laughton/the  Nero  in  ^"The  Sign  of  the  Cross,"  was  a  hotel  clerk.  Since  he  took  up  acting  he  has  appeared  in  more  than  twenty  London  stage  successes  and  two  in  New  York.   /TPHE  best  squelch  of  the  year  goes  to  Jean  Hersholt.  It  seems  a  quickie  producer  hired  Jean  for  one  of  those  "economical  epics"  and  owing  to  Jean's  rather  heavy  salary,  they  worked  him  long  and  hard.  The  first  day  he  worked  ten  hours,  the  next,  twelve  hours  and  the  third,  eighteen  hours.  Finally  the  producer  said  to  Jean,  "Mr.  Her-  sholt, we'll  have  to  use  you  all  day  today  and  all  night,  too.  We've  got  to  finish  this  picture."  But  this  was  too  much.  "Say,"  Jean  said,  "fof-the  love  of  heaven,  who's  wait-  ing for  this  picture,  anyway?"   TX  a  way  there's  something  regrettable  about  ■^lovely  Joan  Crawford  and  her  rapidly  chang-  ing friendships.  Ann  Harding,  Claudette  Col-  bert, etc.  One  friend  for  a  while  and  then  another.   Of  course,  these  friendships  may  have  been  exaggerated  as  in  the  case  of  Marlene  Dietrich  and  Joan.  Marlene  went  twice  to  Joan's  house  and  was  amazed  to  read  about  the  "intimate"  friendship  between  herself  and  Mrs.  Fairbanks.   "We  do  not  speak  of  friendship  so  lightly  in  Europe,"  she  said.  "It  takes  years  to  make  a  friendship,  not  just  two  little  visits. "    38    Will  Hays  should  know  about  this.  Just  look  how  hard  Director  John  Ford  and  Wallace  Beery  are  working  to  keep  harmony  in  the  picture  business!

How  long  he  will  be  gone,  when  he  will  re-  turn, what  he  will  do  in  the  interim  are  ques-  tions for  which  he  does  not  even  try  to  find  the  answers.   Still  suffering  from  the  shock  of  his  divorce  from  Colleen,  John  married  the  former  Janet  Hamilton  Gattis  on  his  last  trip  to  Honolulu  but  news  dispatches  of  their  separation  almost  beat  the  formal  wedding  announcements  to  Hollywood.

So,  they  separated  in  order  to  give  each  other  a  chance  at  happiness.

It  just  doesn't  seem  possible  that  in  his  youthful  years  he  could  have  gained  the  experience  neces-  sary to  such  an  understanding  of  life,  re-  gardless of  his  acting  talent.  He  seems  to  live  every  role.   Take  that  scene  in  "Life  Begins"  where  he  finds  himself  with  a  tiny  baby  on  his  hands.  His  young  wife  dead!  The  average  young  man  of  twenty-three  is  much  too  young  to  have  had  the  ex-  periences to  draw  upon  for  the  sort  of  acting  Linden  gives.   The  boy  has  talent,  naturalness,  sin-  cerity. But  other  lads  have  had  talent  and  still  their  work  has  lacked  force,  power  and  depth  of  emotion.  For  a  twenty-three-year-old  boy  Eric  Linden's  work  has  an  emotional  quality  that  is  astounding.   Bernhardt,  George  Arliss  and  Lewis  Stone  have  said  they  use  technique  and  not  emotion  in  their  acting.  It  is  in-  teresting to  consider  this  theory  when  watching  young  Linden.  What  quality  puts  that  spark  into  his  work  that  makes   AO    soul  that  has  That  seems  a  boy,  but  you'll  Linden's  story    Eric  Linden  doesn't  play  a  part  on  the  screen.  He  relives  his  own  life  tragedies   By  Jeanne  North    his  character  portrayal  seem  inspired  ?     Emotion  or  technique  ?   As  I  watched  Eric  from  the  sidelines  of  a  sound  stage,  my  speculation  led  me  to  try  to  find  the  answer  by  recalling  and  analyzing  what  he  had  told  me  about  his  young  life.   Eric  Linden  is  one  of  the  strangest  young  men  who  ever  came  to  Hollywood.  Outstanding  as  a  unique  personality,  even  among  the  many,  many  unusual  characters  who  find  their  way  to  the  cinema  capital.   There  seems  to  have  been  drama  in  almost  every  moment  of  his  life.  It  wasn't  his  happy  lot  to  have  a  carefree  childhood  and  youth  of  play,  parties,  girls  and  good  times.   NO  fatherless  waif  from  the  pages  of  Dickens  had  a  more  bleak,  drab,  heartbreaking  childhood  than  this  sensitive  lad.  And  until  very  recently  his  life  continued  to  be  a  bitter  struggle.  But  in  spite  of  almost  all  work  and  no  play  his  spirit  kept  him  from  being  "a  dull  boy"  and  has  guided  him  into  becoming  a  splendid  actor.   No,  Eric  Linden's  life  hasn't  been  the  usual  one.  Far  from  it!  This  lad  has  really  lived!  Perhaps  he  isn't  acting  at  all!  His  mind  may  be  reaching  down  into  that  strange  past  of  his  and  drawing  forth  the  emotion  and  reaction  he  has  felt  as  a  human  to  fit  the  part  and  situation  he  is  conveying  at  the  moment  in  the  screen  drama.   This  youngster  was  that  shy,  sensitive  type  of  boy  forced  to  travel  the  hardest,  roughest  road  and  his  keen  emotional  nature  keeps  tearing  the  bandages  from  the  sore  spots  of  his   soul  so  he  may  probe  them  and  make  them  serve  him  now.  The  wounds  inflicted  by  life,  that  once  seemed  to  be  master,  are  now  the  servants  of  his  talent.  He  doesn't  remember  his  father.  His  mother,  a  gentle  Swedish  woman,  was  left  alone  with  her  five  babies  when  Eric  was  just  a  tot  of  one  or  two.  Barely  more  than  a  girl,  she  and  her  husband  had  come  to  America,  and  then  life  stranded  her  in  a  strange  country  with  her  children,  the  youngest  only  a  few  months  old  and  the  eldest  about  five.    GRANTING  the  influence  of  heredity,  Eric  inherited  his  strength  of  character  from  his  mother  and  the  acting  stimulus  from  his  father,  who  had  been  on  the  Swedish  stage.   The  lack  of  a  father  made  quite  a  difference  in  the  path  those  little  feet  were  to  climb.  About  the  first  thing  Eric  re-  members very  clearly  was  trudg-  ing home  from  school — he  was  seven    then— and    hurrying    to   [    PLEASE    TURN    TO    PAGE    104    ]    Eric  and  Mrs.  Linden  have  shared  sor-  row and  poverty.

I  stood  under  the  euca-  lyptus tree  and  watched  him  come,  his  shoulders  squared  for  some  ordeal  ahead,  his  steps  lagging.  He  walked  up  and  looked  at  me  for  a  long  second.  He  didn't  lay  his  hand  on  me,  for  Tom  Mix  knows  how  I  dis-  like to  be  patted  or  fondled.  He  just  stood  there.   "Tony,"  he  said  at  last,  "you  and  me  have  been  buddies  for  a  long  time.  We've  been  through  fire  and  hell  and  heaven  to-  gether. But,  Tony,  the  time  has  come  when  we've  each  got  to  go  our  own  way.  You  un-  derstand, boy?"   He  pointed  to  my  weak  leg.  Yes,  I  understood.  For  a  long  time  I  had  suffered  with  that  leg  but  had  tried  to  ignore  it.  I'd  had  a  lot  of  aches  in  my  life  and  couldn't  believe  this  one,  too,  wouldn't  pass  away.  Then,  during  the  making  of  our  last  picture,  just  as  I  leaped  across  a  stream  with  Tom  on  my  back,  it  had  caught  me — a  sharp,  stabbing  pain.  And  we  both  went  down.  I  knew  it  would  never  be  better.   "You're  going  to  green  pastures,  Tony,"  he  said.  "You've  earned  a  long  rest.  You  know,  don't  you,  old  fellow,  that  often  you've  been  the  only  friend  I  had.  The  one  thing  in  this  world  I  could  come  to.    Well,  I'll  not  forget  you  now."    For  twenty-one  years  there  was  a  great  friend-  ship between  man  and  horse.  Read  Tony's  tribute  to  Tom  Mix,  a  truly  "human"  document    Whoopla!  Those  were  the  days.  Nevermore  will  Tony  carry  Tom  safely  over  mountain  and  chasm    wouldn't  stay  "put."  The  ten-  der grass  on  the  other  side  of  the  street  always  looked  greener,  somehow,  so  I  kept  dashing  across,  dodging  cars  and  wagons.   TWO  men  in  a  car  by  the  r<    HE  laid  his  hand  for  just  a  moment  on  my  head,  and  then  he  was  gone.   I  watched  him  out  of  sight,  over  the  pasture  gate.  I  was  glad  he  had  told  me,  man  to  man,  with  no  sobbing  heroics.  He  knew  I  wouldn't  have  liked  that.   Yet,  as  I  watched  him  go,  my  mind  went  back  to  the  first  time  I  ever  saw  Tom  Mix.    I  was  running  along  by  my  mother's  side.    She  was  hauling  a  vegetable  wagon  and  I  was  too  young  to  be  left  at  home.         jy  q,   But  like  most  colts  (human  ones,  too),  I       AJY     Ofl  YCL    oadside  watched  me.   "Look  at  that  colt,"  one  man   remarked.  "He'd  make  a  good   cutting  pony,  wouldn't  he?  "  A   cutting  pony  is  one  that  can  go  into  a  herd  of  cattle  and  run  out   the  particular  one  that's  wanted.   They  spoke  to  the  vegetable  man  about  me  and  I  heard  him  say,  "  He  belongs  to  my  boy.  If  he  will  sell,  it's  okay  with  me."  The  next  day  I  saw  the  two  men  drive  up  and  speak  to  the  boy.  When  it  was  all  over,  I  had  been  sold  to  one  of  the  men  for  $17.50.  I  soon  learned  my  master's  name  was  Tom  Mix  and  that  he  was  a  movie  actor.  He  rode  "Blue  Boy,"  a  big,  kindly  horse,  and  did  all  sorts  of  tricks.   I  was  placed  in  pasture  with  other  horses.  They  kept  the  name  Tony,  given  me  by  the  son  of  the  vegetable  man.   When  I  was  about  four  years  old,  "Blue  Boy"  died.  They  buried  him  in  this  very  field  and  placed  that  stone  over  him.  "  We  grew  old  together,"  it  reads,  and  bears  Tom's  name.  And  then  one  day,  Tom  came  and  took  me  away.  It  was  the  begin-  ning of  an  amazing  life  for  me.   In  the  mornings  Tom  would  ride  me  j-j-  .  i  out   to  a  place   where   a  group  of  men   11  Q  1111  1 1011        waited  with  [  please  turn  to  page  106  ]    Look  Out!  Here's   Mae  West/    Broadway's  dar-  ling, and  most  spectacular  stage  exhibit,  explodes  on  the   screen    THE  talkies,  perfected  and  petted,  were  getting  just  too  refined  and  genteel!  Human  passions,  on  the  screaming  screen,  were  being  swathed  in  elegant  velvet  and  piped  down  to  mere  whims.  Movie  actors  were  giving  exqui-  site imitations  of  ladies  and  gen-  tlemen.   And  suddenly,  without  the  faintest  peep  of  warning — boom !   There  was  a  terrific  explosion.  A  blonde  bomb  had  gone  off  in  a  cream-puff  factory.  When  we  fans  had  dusted  ourselves  off,  and  the  smoke  had  cleared  away  — there  was  Mae  West!   Mae  West  as  the  indestructible  Maudie  in  "  Night  After  Night."  Blonde,  buxom,  rowdy  Mae —  slithering  across  the  scene  in  a  spangled,  sausage-skin  gown!

But  when  all  the  returns  are  in  and  the  ballots  counted,  I  dare  say  that  the  theater  has  never  sent  Holly-  wood a  more  fascinating,  spec-  tacular and  useful  figure  than  Bounding  Mae  West,  queen  of  the  big-hearted  bad  girls  of  show  business.

She's  a  story-book  person,  this  wild  and  wiggling  West.   Not  only  does  she  act  'em —  she  writes  'em.  The  dialogue-  writer  of  "Night  After  Night,"  after  a  gallant  struggle  to  write  typical  Mae  West  lines,  fainted  dead  away  from  exhaustion,  and  Mae  wrote  her  own  material.  Her  next  picture,  "  Ruby  Red,"  is  from  a  story  of  her  own.  She  specializes  in  naughty  ladies  with  big  souls  and  golden  hearts.  In  the  creation  of  such  dazzling  dames  she  stands  alone  in  American  show-business.   Once  they  are  written,  how  Mae  acts  them!   To  me,  there  is  not  a  greater  sight  on  stage  or  screen  than  Mae  West  sneaking  up  on  a  six-foot  leading  man  with  romance  in  her  heart  and  murder  in  her  eye.

And  I'd  rather  hear  her  say  "Hello,  honey  —  whatta  yah  doin'  tonight?"  in  that  world-  weary  nasal  whine  of  hers,  than  listen  to  the  best  drawing-room  comedy  ever  written  for  beauti-  ful hams  in  tail-coats.   Oh,  there's  no  doubt  about  it!  Mae  West  is  going  to  give  us  some  of  the  jolliest  movie  hours  we've  ever  spent.   She  has  brought  a  new  and  fascinating  figure  to  pictures.  Now  watch  her  go!   And  how  did  she  get  the  way  she  is?   HER  public  life  has  been  just  as  tinseled,  rowdy  and  hila-  rious as  the  dizzy  dames  she  cre-  ates. I've  known  her  for  years,  and  she's  never  failed  to  fascinate  me  as  a  woman  and  an  actress.  She  first  burst  upon  my  pop-  ping eyes  in  the  early  spring  of  1919.  A  grimy  and  bedraggled  young  soldier  just  home  from  the  wars,  I  had  sneaked  away  from  our  Long  Island  camp  to  explore  Broadway  on  $4.60.  That  night  I  found  myself  in  a  cheap  seat  at  "Sometime,"  a  musical  comedy  starring  Mr.  Ed  Goofy  Wynn.   And  there  was  Mae  West — a  slender,  beautiful  ball  of  fire  who  performed  as  a  specialty  dancer  in  high  kicks,  cartwheels  and  fast  taps.  She  was  a  tasty  tornado,  and  I  fell  madly  in  love  with  her,  of  course.   Shortly  thereafter  came  the  great  "Shimmy"  plague,  and  Mae  shook  all  over  the  United  States  as  its  greatest  exponent.  She  herself  estimates  that  the  shakes  she  gave  off  during  those  years,  if  harnessed,  would  have  furnished  heat,  light  and  power  to  the  great  city  of  Chicago  for  six  months.   For  a  time  she  was  teamed  in  vaudeville  with  the  nervous  and  high-strung  Harry  Richman.  (Who  in  the  class  remembers  Mr.  Richman  in  pictures?  What?  Not  one  hand?     Think  now!    Clara  Bow!    Remember?)   But  all  this  fiddle-diddle  was  only  preparation  for   Mae's  greater  career.   One  calm,  quiet  day  an  entertainment  labeled,  chastely  and  simply,  "Sex,"  blew  up  in  the  face  of  New  York  City.   The  author  was  Miss  Mae  West  and  the  star  was  —  yes,  you've  guessed  it,  Johnny! — Miss  Mae  West!   This  delightful  hunk  of  culture  ran  on  for  some  months,  charming  the  excitable   pOSt-War  [  PLEASE   TURN  TO   PAGE  108  ]    Did  Garbo  Marry   Stiller:    Is  there  any  basis  in  fact  for  this  strange  rumor?   By  Axel  In  givers  on    SEVERAL  journalists  who  drifted  up  to  Stock  holm  from  other  cities  in  Europe  are  modestly  and  hopefully  silent  when  given  credit  for  starting  the  rumor  that   Garbo  married  Mauritz  Stiller,  the  Swedish  motion  picture  director,  back  in  1924  when  they  were  both  working  on  a  picture  in  Constantinople.    Was  it  an  inspirational  hunch  they  had?     Was  it  just  a  wild  guess,  or  ? —   There's  an  old  saying  about  fire  being  es-  sential to  flame.  Garbo,  ran  the  gossip,  re-  members Stiller  as  husband  as  well  as  friend  and  comrade  and  director.   Garbo,  said  the  whisperers,  is  a  widow.    The  Swedish  director  and  his  protlge  deft)  thus  strolled  in  Berlin  in  1924.    Was  this  a  promenade  of  husband  and  wife?    The  Greta  Garbo  who  sailed  with  Stiller  for  America  in  1925.  She  was  destined  to  be-  come America's  most  famous  immigrant    "I  have  everything  in  the  world  to  thank  Stiller  for."  Was  Garbo  referring  solely  to  her  film  career  when    she    said   that?    Newspapermen  heard,  and  set  out  to  verify.  Pity  the  poor  newspapermen.   But  the  interesting  part  of  it  all,  of  course,  is  that  rumors  not  infrequently  come  to  stand  as  truth.  Flame  and  fire  again.  You  never  know  for  sure,  even  while  shoulders  are  being  shrugged  in  all  directions;  for  if  the  facts  can  support  a  rumor  they  may  be  able  to  support  reality.   So  put  the  question  on  the  blackboard  and  study  it  carefully:   Did  Garbo  marry  Stiller?   We  begin  with  the  present.   Stockholm,  where  Stiller  and  Garbo  first  met,  got  the  rumor  in  a  newspaper  dispatch  from  Vienna,  and  Stock-  holm newspapers,  in  their  headlines,  immediately  branded  it  as  a  "rovarhistoria,"  or  cock-and-bull  story.   THE  original  story  was  that  Garbo  had  married  Stiller  in  Constantinople  under  a  mutual  pledge  of  secrecy.  That  Garbo,  furthermore,  would  have  kept  the  marriage  a  secret  forever  if  she  hadn't  found  it  necessary  to  put  forward  her  claim  to  a  share  in  Stiller's  estate.   Her  present  visit  to  Sweden,  so  the  rumor  ran,  was  not  so  much  to  find  peace  and  quiet  as  to  take  part  in  legal  proceedings  regarding  division  of  property  left  by  Stiller.   Newspapermen  in  Stockholm  were  stopped  cold.  Lawyers  handling  the  affairs  of  Stiller,  who  died  in  1928,  declared  the  story  false  from  start  to  finish.   47    They  remarked  with  delectable  irony  that  they  ought  to  know  whereof  they  spoke.  Other  persons  who  should  presumably  be  in  the  know  in  the  matter  refuse  to  believe,  and  say  harsh  things  about  people  who  start  rumors.   But  the  gossip  carries  on,  and  here  and  there  one  encounters  a  touch  of  mystery.    There  can  be  no  question  but  what  Stiller  and  Garbo  were  the  best  of  friends.     They  were  together  much  in  Stockholm.     They  were  together  in  Hollywood.     It's  en-  tirely possible,  in  the  way  that  many  things   are   possible,    that    they   may  have    been    more    than   friends,    and  yet —   LET'S  revert  to  the  past.  In  1923,  Stiller,  who  had  definitely  established  himself  as  one  of  the  founders  of  the  motion  picture  in-  dustry as  it  now  exists  in  Sweden,  heard  about  a  girl,  one  Greta  Gustafs-  son,  who  had  played  small  parts  in  a  film  production  and  who  had  com-  pleted her  training  at  the  Royal  Dramatic  School  in  Stockholm.  He  gave  her  a  small  role  in  "Gosta  Ber-  ling's  Saga,"  trained  her  himself,  got  her  to  change  her  name,  and  took  her  to  America.  The  rest  is  history.  While  Garbo  stayed  on  in  Hollywood,  Stiller  came  home  in  1927,  a  bit  disillusioned,  to  die  on  November  8,  1928.   Much  has  been  written,  in  Sweden  at  least,  of  Garbo's  near  fright  when  she  had  her  first  interview  with  Stiller.  There  is  reason  to  believe  that  she  was  frightened.  In  addition  to  being  a  large  man,  more  than  six  feet  tall,  Stiller  had  become  known  for  his  blustering,  shouting  methods  of  directing  a  film  production.  He  insisted  that  the  people  he  directed  do  their  very  best,  bz  more  than  mannikins,and  oftentimes,  it  seems,  he  more  or  less  scared  them  into  real,  honest-to-goodness  acting.    Two  years  after  her  arrival  in  Hollywood  thus  appeared  Greta  in  "Love,"  with  John  Gilbert.  Broken-hearted,  Stiller  had  re-  turned to  Sweden    THAT  first  meeting  must  have  been  a  remarkable  study  in  contrast.  Stiller  was  then  forty,  in  the  full  flush  of  his  success  in  Sweden,  and  a  man  of  the  world  in  many  ways.  Garbo  was  seventeen  and  a  bit  uncertain  about  life,  even  if  she  did  have  positive  ideas  as  to  what  she  wanted  to  do.   The  Stiller  that  Garbo  saw  was  a  man  with  gray-black  hair,  black  mustache,  sharp  but  heavy  eyes  under  heavy   eyelids,  pronounced  black  eyebrows,  and  a  dominant  nose,  all  assembled  together  in  an  unusually  large  head.  It  was  a  face  that  in  many  ways  concealed  the  real  Stiller.   Stiller,  in  turn,  saw  a  young  girl  with  unusually  large  and  clear  eyes  and  long  eyelashes,  and  a  latent  spark  of  determina-  tion and  fire  that  in  many  ways  matched  his  own.  He  saw  a  girl  who  was  yet  to  become  most  impressively  individualistic;  who  was,  all  told,  no  more  than  a  typical  Stockholm  girl.  But  Stiller,  unquestionably  an  artist,  with  originality  of  thought,  and  good  judgment  of  people,  became  certain  of  Garbo's  abilities.  Being  certain  he  proceeded,  with  char-  acteristic drive  and  energy,  to  bring  them  to  full  fruition.   What  Garbo  came  to  know  about  Stiller,  moreover,  was  that  the  man  could  be  as  charming  as  he  could  be  blunt  and  dis-  concerting. He  had  no  desire  to  make  friends  with  people  who  did  not  interest  him.   He  carried  an  intense  conviction  back  of  his  ideas.    But  if  Stiller  wanted  to  make  a  friend,  if  he  wanted  to  be  pleasant,  he  could  be  so  amaz-  ingly and  intelligently  delightful  that  people  could  not  resist  him.  He  was  handsome  in  the  very  irregularity  of  his  features.  There  was  a  charm  in  the  manner  in  which  he  could  shift  his  personality.  The  rough  surface  con-  cealed but  did  not  always  hide.   It  is  no  discredit  to  Garbo  to  say  she  must  have  been  attracted  to  Stiller.  She  was  young  and  a  dreamer.  He  was  older  and  knew  the  world.  He  had  it  in  his  power  to  help  her,  and  did  help  her.  He  was,  in  many  ways,  the  symbol  of  what  she  wanted  to  be.  On  the  venture  to  America  he  must  have  been,  to  an  immense  degree,  a  steadying  and  sympa-  thetic influence.   And  keep  in  mind  the  marked  simi-  larities of  personality  and  attitudes  and  ambition.  Both  determined  to  succeed.  Both  convinced  that  they  needed  a  greater  scope  for  their  talents.  Both  independent  in  thought.  With  Stiller  excited  about  having  found  a  real  actress.  With  Garbo  excited  about  the  future.   THEY  had  much  in  common,  these  two,  and  from  the  time  of  that  first  meeting  they  were  much  together.  It  was  Stiller  who  took  Garbo  to  Berlin  and  to  Constantinople;  who,  through  his  own  ambitions  and  desire  to  develop,  encouraged  the  same  thoughts  in  Garbo.  It  is  easy  to  understand  Garbo's  respect  and   admiration  for   Stiller.   At  the  time  Stiller  had  a  reputation  for  being  a  rather  thorough-going  bachelor.  People  who  knew  him  say  that  he  more  or  less  avoided  women.  But  there  is  no  reason  to  believe,  on  the  other  hand,  that  he  was  immune  to  feminine  charms,  and  Garbo  was  attrac-  tive. Stiller,  in  developing  and  bring-  ing out  that  attractiveness  and  charm,  as  an  artist  bringing  out  the  colors  in  a  painting,  could  hardly  have  been  una-  ware of  the  result.   That  they  might  have  married  in  Constantinople  is  possible.  Marriage  in  Sweden  requires  formal  announce-  ment in  church  and  newspapers.  A  secret  trip  to  the  altar  in  Stockholm  would  have  been  difficult.  But  Con-  stantinople is  quite  a  distance  from  Sweden.  And  Stiller  might  well  have  reasoned  that  a  public  marriage  would  be  a  drawback  to  the  career  of  his  pro-  fessional ward.   On  the  other  hand,  the  reasons  for  branding  the  marriage  rumor  as  false  are  numerous.  Men  who  knew  Stiller  are  convinced  his  interest  in  Garbo  was  not  that  deep.  And  no  adequate  reason  has  been  advanced  as  yet  why  they  should  have  married  secretly,  or  how  they  could  have  kept  their  marriage  a  secret.  On  the  face  of  it,  it  seems  absurd  that  the  tempestuous  Garbo,  in  love  with  a  man,  and  married  to  him,  could  avoid  any  in-  direct acknowledgment  of  the  fact.  Against  this,  of  course,  can  be  matched  the  very  secrecy  of  her  life  in  Hollywood.   THE  theory  that  Garbo  desires  to  share  in  Stiller's  estate  also  is  ridiculed,  and  perhaps  rightfully  so.  Stiller  has  a  brother  in  California  and  a  sister  in  Sweden.  There  are  other  claims  against  his  estate  which  was  not  large.  Even  if  Garbo  needed  money,  which  is  doubtful,  it  would  be  difficult  for  her  to  press  any  claims  without  coming  partly  into  the  open  about  them.     And  the  lawyers  deny.   A  friend  of  Stiller's?     Unquestionably.   "I  have  everything  in  the  world  to  thank  Stiller  for,"  Garbo  has  said  repeatedly.

Probably  there  is  more  idle  specula-  tion about  the  Fays  than  the  average  picture  couple,  because  they  talk  so  seldom  about  themselves.  Hollywood  is  never  capable  of  understanding  those  who  do  not  employ  "selves"  as  the  certain  subject  of  conversation.   This  speculation  has  touched  every  possible  subject.  The  recurring  divorce  rumors;  the  insistent  repeti-  tion of  the  story  that  Barbara  is  quar-  relling with  Warner  Brothers  because   of  Frank's  former  quarrel  with  Warner  Brothers.  The  lavish  cost  of  their  new  mansion-home.  Literally  hundreds  of  curious,  eager  suppositions.   The  answers  form  one  of  the  most  interesting  chapters  of  Hollywood  history — culminating  with  Barbara's  new  contract  with  Warner  Brothers  and  the  sale  of  Frank's  first  self-produced  picture.   Barbara  will  do  three  pictures  this  year  instead  of  six  as  she  did  last.  She  has  a  voice  in  the  selection  of  her  stories.  The  pro-  ducers will  submit  six  for  each  picture;  if  she  does  not  like  any  of  them,  the  final  choice  will  be  made  in  a  conference  between  producers  and  Barbara  and  Frank  Fay.   She  will  do  no  more  "back  to  the  farm"  roles,  at  least  for  the  present.  The  picking  of  cabbages  and  potatoes  are  taboo.  Dramatic  sophistication  will  be  the  first  choice.   Frank's  sale  of  the  first  of  his  series  in  which  he  is  producer  and  actor  is  a  true  triumph.    It  will  be  released  by  Warner  Brothers,  for  whom  he  once  starred.  He  received  one  hundred  thousand  dollars  as  an  advance  on  the  profits — a  certain  proof  that  it  is  a  good  picture.   He  will  make  three  more  immedi  ately.     Among  them  is  the  fiction-  ized  history  of  the  life  of  Stephen  P"oster,  composer  of  "Way  Down  Upon     the     Swanee     River,"  "Old  Black  Joe"  and  other  all-  time  favorites.     Frank  expects  much   from   this.     Of  course,  the  songs  will  be  in  it.   The  Fay  adopted  son  and  heir  is  eight  months  old  and  has  had  his  first  two  teeth  without  a  murmur  of  discomfort.  He's  as  brown  as  a  well-baked  apple,  as  healthy  as  a  perfect-baby  prize-winner  and  as  intelli-  gently cunning  as  an  eight-  months-old  can  be.   THE  new  estate  has  a  large  house,  gymnasium,  swim-  ming pool,  bath-bungalow  and  all  the  other  accessories  neces-  sary to  complete  three  acres  of  subtle  comforts  and  beauty.   At  last,  the  Barbara-Frank  household  is  in  order!   But  it  is  the  manner  in  which  it  grew  to  such  stable  solidity  that  I  consider  one  of  the  most  revealing    and   entertaining    They've  see-sawed  up  and  down,  have  Barbara  and  Frank,  not  caring  which  one  was  riding  the  upward  side,  so  long  as  they  could  have   their  fun   together   52    While  Hollywood's  going  over  the  affairs  of  Barbara  Stanwyck  and  Frank  Fay,  we'll  discuss    them,    too   By  Ruth  Biery    stories  in  the  film  city.  I  am  going  to  review  it  for  you  chronologically  so  you  can  see  it  as  a  whole  and  answer  all  these  Hollywood  speculations  to  your  own  satisfaction.   As  you  know,  Frank  Fay  had  been  one  of  the  headliners  of  Broadway  for  fifteen  years.  He  owned  his  own  night  club,  too — seven  dollars  cover  charge.  A  terse  compliment  to  its  swankiness!   Barbara  had  played  for  two  con-  secutive years  on  Broadway  in  "  Bur-  lesque."   A  record.   In  1929,  Joseph  Schenck  brought  them  to  Hollywood  in  his  private  car  to  make  pictures  for  United  Artists.  Those  were  the  early,  hectic,  we-don't-know-where-we-are-going  days  of  the  talkies.  Now  Frank  and  Barbara  didn't  expect  Hollywood  to  know  much  about  them.  But  it  was  a  shock  to  have  an  important  producer  approach  Frank  on  the  train  to  ask,  "Mr.  Fay,  what  did  you  do  on  the  stage?"   Frank  is  red-headed,  Irish,  impulsive  and  gifted  with  an  amazing  sense  of  rapid-fire  humor.  "I'm  a  juggler."   "Do  you  think  juggling  will  get  over  in  pictures?"  "I'm  a  dramatic  juggler."  "Oh,  I  see."   The  name  of  Frank  Fay,  in  foot-high  letters  on  Broadway  for  fifteen  years  had  meant  absolutely  nothing  to  one  of  the  most  important  studio  bosses.   Norma  Talmadge,  Mary  Pickford,  Douglas  Fairbanks,  Irving   Thalberg  and  a  host  of  other  most-importants  were   at  the  train  to  welcome  Joseph  Schenck  back  to   Hollywood's  warm  bosom.  Barbara  naively   imagined  he  must  be  returning  from  at   least  a  year's  absence  in  some  foreign   country.   But  when  one  of  the  great  asked  him  if  he  had  enjoyed  his  trip  and  he  replied,  "Three  weeks  is  a  short  time  to  enjoy  New  York,"  Barbara  realized  she  was  in  a  land  of  new  customs  where  natives  pay  tribute  to  return-  ing kings,  even  though  they  have  been  merely  commuting  between  cities.    B    OTH  Barbara  and  Frank  realized  the  weirdness  of  this  new  land  more  and  more  as  one  Hollywood  day  tumbled  into  another.  Barbara  was  cast  almost  immediately  in  "The  Locked  Door."  '  But  there  was  a  hesitation  about  Frank's  assignment.   "He  may  be  a  big  shot  on  Broadway,  but  whoever  heard  of  him  any  other  place?"  seemed  to  be  the  complicating  question.  A  producer  sum-  moned a  passing  office  boy,  a  stenographer  and  a  paper  car-  rier and  asked,  "  Did  you  ever  hear  of  Frank  Fay?"   One  of  these  local  products  had  had  the  price  to  see  Frank  during  the  several  times  he  had  played  Los  Angeles.  "Sure,  he's   a   swell   actor,"  he  said.   "  One  out  of  three—  you  see?  "  the  producer  demanded.

It  was  Teach-  in  July.  "Resolved:    That  during   1933,  I  shall  not  build  a  house,  or  any  part  or  parcel  thereof."   I  did  my  building  in  1932 — a  summer  home  at  Laguna  Beach,  California.  I  didn't  exactly  build  it — I  merely  paid  the  bills.  Our  plans  called  for  a  six-room  cottage —  we  finished  with  seventeen.   The  only  Hollywood  stars  whose  suggestions  are  not  reflected  in  our  home  are  the  five  who  were  out  of  town  during  its  construction;  Fairbanks  in  China  and  the  Four  Marx  Brothers,  two  in  the  hospital  and  Harpo,  running  true  to  form,  with  nothing  to  say.   But  Groucho  came  down  to  Laguna  after  the  structure  had  been  completed.   "Slim,"  said  the  erudite  Groucho,  "your  home  is  beautiful.  It  breathes  genius.  There  has  been  in  Hollywood,  I  regret  to  say,  a  decadence  in  architecture — a  return  to  the  pagan  swimming  pool — but  this  place — ah,  Slim,  it  thrills  with  the  inspiration  of  a  master  builder.  Architecturally  speaking,  it  surpasses  the  great  Notre  Dame  cathedral  in  Paris,  by  two  up  and  three  to  play.   "Where  your  home  faces  the  ocean,  I  find  a  subtle  trace  of  the  Renaissance;  there  is  a  superb  Gothic  delicacy  on  the  north,  a  pure  Roman  influence  in  the  south  and  a  magnificent  reflec-  tion of  the  early  Byzantine  toward  the  rising  sun.  It  is  Cyclopean  in  its  generosity;  plethoric  in  its  cultural  grandeur.  It  is  neither  cryptic  nor  sacerdotal,  but,  Slim,  it  will  always  be  popular."   I  thanked  Dr.  Marx,  saying  that  was  exactly  the  effect  we  had  aimed  at.   As  we  reached  the  cellar,  Groucho  clapped  his  hands  in  sheer  ecstasy.   "  I  observe,"  he  beamed,  "that  even  here,  you  have  not  forgot-  ten your  alchemistic  symbolism."   I  replied  very  proudly  that  I  had  attended  to  that  the  very  first  thing  and  showed  the  two  five-gallon  crocks  so  cemented  to  the  cellar  floor  that  they  could  not  be  re-  moved even  by  the  smartest  of  Mr.  Volstead's  boys.    Don't  take    any    advice   about  building    IN  the  beginning,  we  had  no  idea  of  a  beach  home.  The  original  Summerville  idea  was  a  ranch — on  the  desert's  rim — broad,  sweeping  acres,  shady  patios,   lowing  kine,    friend's  a  bouse.  Slim  did.  When  he  saw  his  empty  purse  he  made  this  New  Year's  resolution  —  last   July    "Now  this  is  wrong  here,"  cheerfully  remarks  Slim's  director,  Edward  Ludwig,  as  he  points  out  an  architectural  error  in  the  blue  print.  You  needn't  ask  what  Slim  is  thinking  about.  The  expression  on  his  face  tells  the  story    ponies  and  packhorses  and  a  crackling  sagebrush  fire  at  night.  But  like  others  before  us,  we  tarried  by  the  wayside,  stopping  to  visit  at  Laguna  Beach — cultural  home  of  world-famous  artists,  writers  and  a  recent  invasion  of  picture  folk.  We  were  attracted  to  a  house  built  around  a  large,  rectangular  living-  room,  with  an  inviting,  wide-hearthed  fireplace.   The  owner  offered  what  seemed  a  bargain.  Furthermore,  here  at  last  was  the  realization  of  another  dream — an  oppor-  tunity for  a  motion  picture  actor  to  get  something  without  pay-  ing a  ten  per  cent  commission  to  a  contact  man — a  chance,  perhaps,  never  to  come  again.   WE  hastened  to  buy,  the  deed  was  recorded,  the  cottage  was  ours.      Our  happy  meditations  were  brought  to  an  abrupt  ending  by  the  hilarious  entrance  of  Polly  Moran.   She  agreed  the  living-room  was  grand,  but  there  had  to  be  more  and  better  bedrooms.  "Tear  down  everything  but  the  living-room  and  build  around  it,"  she  suggested.  Swell  idea!  I  hunted  up  an  architect  and  a  contractor  and  we  soon  had  plans  and  specifications  calling  for  a  six-room  cottage  to  cost  "somewhere  around  six  thousand  dollars  "   The  city  engineer  brought  the  news  that  the  old  foundation  wouldn't  support  the  proposed  remodeling.  The  architect  said  a  new  one  wouldn't  cost  more  than  eight  hundred  dollars.    Oh,   well—   Fredric  March  and  Ralph  Bell-  amy, fellow-citizens  of  Laguna,  argued  remodeling  was  an  expensive  proposition — better  tear  the  whole  thing  down  and  build  a  modern  cottage.   So  up  started  the  new  house,  when  the  architect  called  a  quick  halt.  He'd  forgotten  the  "nooks"  in  the  big  rooms.  We'd  never  had  a  nook  and  didn't  want  any.  He  insisted    all    modern    rooms    must   [  PLEASE  TURN'  TO  PACE   112  ]   53    The  Lure  of  New  York  Stage    HERE  is  something  that,  it  is  said,  has  never  appeared  upon  the  screen  before.     It  will  be  shown  in  Warner  Brothers'  production  of  back  stage  theatrical  life — "42nd  Street."   The  new  feature  you  will  see  in  this  picture  is  a  series  of  three  revolving  stages,  each  of  which  is  really  a  large  disc,  turning    in  opposite  directions.  The  cameras  are  mounted  on  the  outer  disc  and,  of  course,  travel  with  it.   As  the  dancers  go  through  their  movements,  the  effect  is  dizzying  and  breath-taking — one  finds  himself  gripping  the  seat  ahead  for  support.   Above  we  see  one  of  the  big  dance  numbers  of  the  show.    Life  Set  to  Music  and  Drama    Those  two  cute  girls  with  the  lights  turned  full  upon  them  are  Ginger  Rogers  and  Una  Merkel,  whose  parts  call  for  a  place  in  the  chorus.   This  is  one  of  those  scenes  in  the  production  for  which  highly  technical  knowledge  is  necessary.   So  directors  stand  back  while  a  dance  expert — the  man  with    Photo  by  Stagg   out-pointed   finger — puts  the   hoofers  through  special  dance  steps.   And  looming  over  all  are  the  figures  of  Dick  Powell,  Warner  Baxter,  Ginger  Rogers,  Bebe  Daniels  and  George  Brent — the  major  characters  in  the  rhythm,  the  laughter,  the  music  and  the  heartaches  of  "42nd  Street."

Joe  Brown  doesn't  get  across  the  Catalina  Channel  by  swallowing  it,  either.  His  impromptu  aquaplane  ride  is  a  high  spot  in  hilarity.  Ginger  Rogers  was  made  for  a  bathing  suit,  and  somebody's  idea  of  kidding  "Strange  Interlude"  is  price-  less.   Don't  miss  the  fun.    SPENCER  TRACY  plays  a  tough  guy  who  goes  to  prison  with  a  carnation  in  his  buttonhole.  He  makes  the  picture  real  in  spite  of  the  rather  unconvincing  story  of  a  man's  experi-  ence from  his  entrance  into  prison  to  his  exit  through  the  death  house.  Bette  Davis  as  the  girl  in  love  with  Spencer,  and  Lyle  Talbot  as  a  rebellious  prisoner  are  good.  Arthur  Byron  plays  a  humane  warden.    Sparkling  dialogue.    THE  MATCH  KING—   First  National    EVENINGS  FOR  SALE-  Paramount    FREELY  adapted  from  the  life  of  Ivar  Kreuger,  this  picture  is  distinguished  by  the  interesting  performance  of  Warren  William  in  the  title  part.  Paul  Kroll  begins  as  a  racketeering  street-sweeper,  rises  by  unscrupulous  methods  to  control  of  the  match  industry,  and  as  circumstances  close  around  him,  com-  mits suicide.  Lili  Damita,  who  essays  a  Garbo  type  of  role,  falls  somewhat  short  of  being  one,  but  her  clothes  are  lovely.    GOOD  entertainment,  with  Mary  Boland  stealing  honors  as  a  sentimental  American  widow  with  ten  millions  and  a  desire  to  see  the  Vienna  of  her  "  Merry  Widow"  dreams.  Plenty  of  sparkle,  beautiful  sets;  and  romance  by  Herbert  Marshall,  as  the  pauperized  post-war  count,  and  Sari  Maritza.  Sari  is  charming,  and  Marshall  will  make  feminine  hearts  beat.  Charlie  Ruggles,  sober  for  a  change,  is  even  funnier  than  usual.    UPTOWN  NEW  YORK-  World  Wide    THE  MASK   OF   FU  MANCHU   —M-G-M    JACK  OAKIE  gives  a  fine  performance  as  Eddie,  a  regular  guy  who  falls  for  a  lady  with  a  past,  played  by  Shirley  Grey.  The  way  they  meet  is  a  comic  high  spot.  The  picture  has  grand  comedy  throughout  and  fine  dramatic  value.  The  musical  accompaniment  is  excellent,  as  you  would  expect  from  Victor  Schertzinger,  who  directed.  Vina  (Bad  Girl)  Delmar,  the  writer,  clicks  again  with  a  fine  human-interest  yarn.   58    EXCEPT  for  the  kids,  who  cannot  seem  to  get  enough  thrillers,  "Fu  Manchu"  is  a  disappointment.  The  sets  are  handsome  and  the  cast  excellent — Boris  Karloff  as  the  dreaded  Fu  Manchu;  Lewis  Stone,  Karen  Morley,  Myrna  Loy,  Jean  Hersholt,  Lawrence  Grant  and  Charles  Starrett.  The  story  is  about  British  scientists  who  seek  the  mask  and  sword  of  Genghis  Kahn  and  their  struggle  to  outwit  Fu  Manchu.

In  order  to  convince  a  young  playwright  (Joel  McCrea)  that  she's  no  lady,  Connie  throws  custard  pies  and  cuts  no  end  of  capers.  Jobyna  Howland,  as  the  constantly  inebriated  mother,  is  grand.  Paul  Lukas  has  a  small  part.    Connie,  as  usual,  is  worth  seeing.

Boris  Karloff  here  represents  an  ancient  mummy  that  has  come  to  life    Meet   the   Monster/   Boris  Karloff  can  perhaps  impersonate  evil  more  convinc-  ingly than  any  other  man    in    pictures   By  Ruth   Rankin    This  is  the  story  of  his  long  fight  to  achieve  a  burning  ambition.   Boris  Karloff  was  born  in  England  forty-five  years  ago.  He  was  the  youngest  of  eight  brothers  and  one  sister.  He  borrowed  the  name  of  Karloff  from  his  mother's  side  of  the  house,  which  was  Russian.   He  sailed  for  Canada  in  1909  with  a  few  personal  belongings  and  an  ambition  which  never  left  him.   HE  had  to  take  the  first  opportunity  of  work  that  he    ^he  could  find.  A  man  with  twenty-eight  cents  in  his  pocket  can't  be  very  particular.  He  joined  a  pick  and  shovel  crew.     No  pay  check  for  a  week.   I  HAD  heard  that  Boris  Karloff  said  it  would  not  be  worth      Twenty-eight   divided   by   seven   isn't   very   nourishing,   but  going  through  again  his  twenty  year  struggle  for  success, —      Karloff  lived  on  four  cents  a  day  for  seven  days,  as  extra  man,  truck-driver  and  pick  and  shovel  "stiff."  One  morning  he  picked  up  a  newspaper  and  came  across  an   This  struck  me  as  a  strong  statement.     I  asked  him      advertisement:      "Experienced  character  actor  wanted,"  by  about  it.  the  Brandon  Players.   Yes,  it  was  true,  he  said.    He  had  endured  incredible  hard-  A  chance,  an  opening,  at  last.    And  no  price  was  too  great  to   ship  and  frustration.    He  had  worked  at  back-breaking  manual      pay  for  this  chance,  labor.    He  dug  ditches  and  hoisted  three-hundred-pound  casks  Karloff  disregarded  that  word  "experience'^and  landed  his    of  nails.  He  loaded  trucks  with  a  shovel  and  unloaded  them  by  shovel.   When  he  couldn't  get  work,  he  went  hungry.  He  slept  on  benches  in  parks.  He  knows  a  raw  and  elemental  half-section  of  life  as  few  men  have  known  it.   And  voluntarily  he  went  through  this  hell  of  hard  labor,  cold,  some-  times starvation,  because  he  had  an  ideal  and  lived  up  to  it.   He  had  a  shining  ambition,  and  he  had  to  live  while  he  was  striving  to  attain  it.  He  had  to  work  with  his  hands  for  it.  Work,  and  cling  to  it  with  every  ounce  of  strength  in  him.  He  could  have  taken  the  easy  way,  renounced  his  ideal,  and  the  good  things  of  life  would  have  been  his  for  the  asking.   He  wanted  to  be  an  actor,  and  he  had  to  battle  life  on  his  own  to  achieve  this  ambition.  There  was  no  easy  way  here,  no  short  cut.   His  family  expected  him  to  go  into  the  consular  service  of  the  English  government.  But  he  want-  ed to  be  an  actor  so  he  ran  away.   m    But  nothing  can  look  as  wicked  as  the  "Heathen  Chinee,"  as  you  must  admit  in  here  beholding  Karloff,  who  plays  the  sinister    role    in    "Mask    of   Fu  Manchu"    first  acting  job.  Thirty  dollars  a  week.  Perhaps  an  actor  was  the  last  thing  he  was.  at  that  embry-  onic stage.  Anyway,  he  worked  hard.  He  specialized  in  villains,  leering  with  terrifying  menace,  to  the  delight  of  provincial  audiences.   The  Players  went  broke  and  dis-  banded in  Saskatchewan  in  1912.   A  few  days  later,  someone  tossed  a  copy  of  the  Billboard  out  of  a  train  window,  and  again  he  found  a  job  through  an  adver-  tisement.   THIS  one  ended  in  Chicago  in  1914.  Then,  when  the  war  broke  out,  he  tried  to  enlist  in  the  British  Army.  With  unconscious  irony,  they  turned  down  this  man  who  had  survived  unspeakable  hard-  ships, exhausting  toil  for  days  at  a  stretch,  who  had  slept  in  the  open  with  a  newspaper  between  himself  and  the  penetrating  Canadian  cold — turned  him  down  because  they  said  he  had  a  heart  murmur.

The  beaded  bolero  terminates  in  two  broad  shoulder  straps  at  the  back,  extend-  ing to  the  waistline.  Bracelets  are  a  nice  accessory  note  with  this  dress.    Q£k^£    WHITE  brocade  is  gaily  patterned  in  tiny  flowers  for  these  graceful  evening  slip-  pers, accented  by  an  unusual    use    of    braid.    THIS  leaf  belt  'buckle,  in  nickel  or  gold,  is  the  best  excuse  in  the  world  for  buying  a  new  belt.  Good  on  fabric  or  leather.    DLACK  calf  Dg  e  n  e  ro  u  s  I  y  studded  with  silver  nailheads  makes  about  as  smart  a  bag  as  you  can  possess.    QUILTED  satin  is  luxurious  and  appropriate  for  afternoon.  A  talon  fastener  re-  places  the  usual  clasp.

Warren  William  discusses  screen  technique  with  Muriel  Gordon,  a  co-worker  in  Warners'  "Employees'  Entrance."  Want  to  know  the  secret  of  his  clipped-off  name? — it  used  to  be  Warren  William  Krech!    _    Her  longue  in  Her  Cheek    Madge  Evans  realizes  now  that  the  Hollywood  game  is  a  com-  plex one,  requir-  ing the  greatest  sportsmanship    NO  leading  lady  nov-  ice has  ever  had  the  meteorical   rise  of  Madge  Evans.    Remem-  ber the  fuss  Metro  made  about  her?  There  is  no  way  of"  estimating  the  amount  of  money  they  spent  in  publi-  cizing this  "new  find,"  but  it  would  as-  suredly run  into  tens  of  thousands  of  dol-  lars!   And  Madge  made  good!    Money  is  spent  m  titanic  waves  in  Hollywood  to  publicize  one  starlet  after  another.     "New  faces"  is  the  uni-  versal cry  of  all  picture  producers.    They  spend  seemingly  endless  sums  in  telling  the  public,  "Here  is  a  discovery.    She  will  be  another  Garbo,  Die-  trich or  Bennett."   The  producers  are  not  foolishly  optimistic.  They  are  merely  hoping.  They  gamble  on  their  hopes,  and  like  most  gamblers  win  one  out  of  a  thousand  times.  But  those  few,  scattered  wins  are  what  eventually  return  them  an  interest  on  all  of  their  investments.  Assuredly,  Dietrich  and  Garbo,  for  examples,  have  paid  the  losses  on  thousands  of  girls  who  were  advertised  as  "dis-  coveries" and  proved  to  be  "flops."   Madge  promised  to  cover  many  "flops"  who  had  preceded  her.  Not  as  a  Garbo  or  Dietrich,  but  as  a  leading  woman  who  could  increase  the  box-office  income  of  any  male  star  with  whom  she  played.   And  as  box-office  leading  men  are  as  scarce  as  a  farmer's  profits,  so  are  leading  women.  We  have  told  you  many  times  in  Photoplay  how  difficult  it  is  to  find  heroes  to  play  opposite  Garbo,  Shearer,  Crawford  and  Bennett.  Well,  it  is  just  as  tough  to  locate  girls  who  can  act  to  play  with  Gable,  Montgomery,  Colman  or  Barrymore  (John)!   Loretta  Young  is  the  perfect  example  of   an  adequate  leading  woman.     Also  Mary  Brian,   Frances  Dee,  Carole  Lombard.     Also,  Madge  Evans.   Metro  realized  this.  They  also  realized  the  day  had  come  when  there  must  be  more  than  one  good  name  to  a  picture.  A  male  star  must  have  a  heroine  whose  name  was  as  important  as  her  face  and  her  figure.  They  decided  to  make  Madge's  name  important.   Madge  helped  them.  She  did  a  good  job  in  every  picture  in  which  she  was  cast.  She  carved  a  place  for  herself  that  few  carve  so  quickly.  Previewing  a  picture  in  which  she  was  lead-  ing lady  for  Bob  Montgomery,  I  left  the  theater  behind  a  mother  and  son,  the  latter  about  twenty-one.   "That's  the  kind  of  girl  I'd  like  to  see  you  marry,"  said  the    Eva  line  Lie  be r    mother.     "She's  so  pretty  and  wholesome. "   "  Gee,  you  wouldn't  have  to  urge  me,  mums! "  he  an-  swered.   And  that's  what  Madge  Evans  does  to  them.   And  then,  right  in  the  middle  of  this  successfully-  started  career,  she  left  Me-  tro! Refused  to  sign  the  contract  they  gave  her.  The  papers  said  she  was  going  to  free-lance.   Incidentally,  she  left  at  about  the  same  time  that  Marian  Marsh,  Evalyn  Knapp  and  Jimmy  Cagney  were  telling  Warner  Broth-  ers goodbye.  And  for  nearly  a  year  you  heard  nothing  about  Marsh,  Knapp  or  Evans.  You  heard  plenty  of  Cagney.  He  saw  to  that.  He  made  threats.  He  turned  Bolshevik.  He  did  everything  but  stand  on  a  soap  box  on  Hollywood  Boulevard.  Wise  boy.  Per-  haps it  wasn't  temperament  as  much  as  brains  with  Jimmy.  He  didn't  have  a  high-paid  publicity  depart-  ment to  honk  the  horn  for  him,  so  he  honked  it  him-  self. He  saw  that  the  pub-  lic didn't  have  a  moment's  chance  to  forget  Jimmy  Cagney.   But  Madge  and  Evalyn  and  Marian  were  ladies.  They  faded  from  the  pic-  ture behind  a  smoke  screen  of  silence.   Madge  says  with  a  twinkle  in  her  now  wide-  open  eyes,  "If  it  hadn't  been  for  Tom  Gallery,  I'd  never  have  had  my  name  in  the  paper.  Running  around  with  Tom  proved  a  bless-  ing."       •   Since  Madge  had  never  been  seen  with  a  Hollywood  "  beau"  before  and  since  Tom  was  being  divorced  by  ZaSu  Pitts,  the  newspaper  boys  did  keep  her  name  in  the  black  lines.  Although  Tom  was  not  as  good  copy  as  red-headed  Cagney's  soap  boxes.  And  yet  Madge  had  her  tongue  in  her  cheek  during  all  those  months  when  she  was  supposed  to  be  "not  working."  When  she  left  Metro  she  was  receiving  seven  hundred  fifty  dollars  a  week.  Her  contract  called  for  a  raise  to  twelve  hundred  fifty.  Metro  wished  to  retain  her  services  at  the  seven  hundred  fifty  figure.     Miss  Evans  walked  out  on  them.   She  had  every  intention  of  returning  to  the  stage — imme-  diately. Her  trunks  were  packed.  You'd  have  to  know  Madge  and  the  serious  way  in  which  she  analyzes  life  to  believe  this,  although  I  know  it  is  her  true  theory.  "It  wasn't  just  money.  I  had  saved  money  on  seven  hundred  fifty  a  week.  I  could  continue  to  save  it.    That  is  big   [  please  turn  to  page  108  ]   69    When  her  screen  career  looked  most  prom-  ising, Madge  followed  Jimmy  Cagney's  example  and  held  out  for  more  money.  Like  a  good  soldier,  she  won  the  fight,  but  how  about  the  scars  and  stripes  of  battle?    JDeauty  Is  Made,  IMot  £>    orn    This  is  Sylvia,  to  whom  the  women  of  this  country  owe  a  big  vote  of  thanks  for  her  efforts  toward  giving  them  all  lovely  faces  and   figures    NOW,  girls,  if  you  aren't  satisfied  with  your  figures  it  isn't  your  Aunt  Sylvia's  fault.  Goodness  knows,  I've  done  my  best  in  this  series  of  articles  to  show  you  how  to  be  slim  or  plumper.  I've  talked  straight  to  you  and  have  never  once  handed  you  any  hokum,  but  there  are  a  few  more  things  I  want  to  tell  you.   With  you  who  have  written  telling  me  about  the  improve-  ment in  your  figures,  I  am  pleased  and  delighted.  Good  girls!  I  give  you  a  pat  on  the  back — a  good  hard  pat,  too,  to  make  you  hold  your  shoulders  up.  But  I  want  you  to  keep  it  up — keep  up  the  diet  and  the  exercises  until  you  are  exactly  where  you  want  to  be  from  the  standpoint  of  weight.  And,  even  when  you  have  reached  perfection,  don't  slip  back  into  your  old  ways.   You  who  haven't  had  the  courage  to  go  along  with  me —  I  want  to  tell  you  that  there  is  still  time  for  you  to  snap  out  of  it.  Get  the  back  issues  of  Pho-  toplay, for  in  them  you'll  find  the  way  to  beauty  and  health.  It's  not  too  late  to  start  im-  proving yourself.  And  when  you  see  the  stars  of  the  screen  and  realize  that  very  few  of  them  had  the  perfect  figures  at  the  beginning  that  they  now  have,  doesn't  it  make  you  want  to  be  as  lovely  as  they?  You  can  be,  you  know;  you  can  be  anything  you  want  to  be.   I  wish  you  could  have  seen  Alice  White's  figure  when  she  first  came  to  me.  She  was  very  much  overweight — but  look  at  that  slim  little  form  now.   When  Joan  Crawford  arrived  in  Hollywood  she  was  a  plump  girl— not  at  all  poised  or  sure  of  herself.  Now  she  has  one  of  the  most  beautiful  figures  on    the  screen  and  the  assurance  that  comes  with  loveliness.  Look  at  Joan  Crawford's  slim  hips — you  can  have  them,  too,  if  you  can  show  the  patience  and  persistence  that  Joan  has  shown.   Norma  Shearer  had  a  great  many  handicaps  during  her  first  film  days — but  is  there  anyone  more  lovely  than  she  is  now?  Can  anyone  wear  evening  clothes  with  more  grace?   Constance  Bennett  was  a  patient  of  mine  for  a  long  time.  Instead  of  being  too  fat,  Connie  was  prone  to  be  underweight,  but  she  is  wise  enough  to  do  everything  she  can  to  put  on  the  pounds  she  needs.  Her  figure  has  improved  a  hundred  per  cent  since  she  came  to  Hollywood  and  she  is  known  as  one  of  the  best  dressed  women  on  the  screen.  I  could  go  on  and  on  telling  you  about  the  girls  in  pictures  who  have  fought  hard  to  be  lovely,  with  the  result  you  see  when  you  go  to  movies.   But  I  don't  want  to  take  up  any  more  time  pointing  out  such  an  obvious  fact.  I  want  to  talk  to  you  and  tell  you  a  few  of  the  things  you  must  avoid  if  you  are1  to  be  everything  it  is  your  right  to  be.   DEYELOP  your  personality  by  being  yourself.  If  you  have  a  hasty  temper  overcome  it,  and  the  best  way  to  overcome  a  bad  disposition  is  to  take  my  diet  and  exercises.  You  feel  so  good  while  you're  doing  the  things  I  advise  that  you  can't  be  cranky — your  eyes  sparkle  and  a  smile  comes  easily  because  you  are  full  of  health  and  energy.  But  you  can't  have  pep  and  health  if  you're  eating  wrong.  Don't  eat  rich  pastries.  Don't  eat  fried  potatoes,  or  fried  fish,  meat  or  eggs.  Broil  or  roast  everything  you  eat.  Avoid  heavy  mayonnaise  and  rich,  greasy  gravies.  Avoid  the  stuffing  from  duck  and  goose,  as  these  dressings  take  all  the  grease  from  the  skin  of  the  fowl.   Get  plenty  of  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables — but  cook  the  veg-  etables in  plain  water  and  put  the  butter  on  cold,  after  the  vegetables  are  done.  Drink  plenty  of  tomato  juice  and  eat  lots  of  gelatin.    It's  hard  to  believe  that  the  rather  robust  dancer  at  the  left  is  the  same  Joan  Crawford  at  the  right.  Even  Joan,  herself,  must  sometimes  wonder.  This  is,  however,  a  startling  example  of  what  determination,  work  and  control  can  achieve  in  beauty.    Do  you  recognize  Joan's  dance  partner?    It's  Ramon  Novarro    70    Says  Sylvia    OYLVIA  is  known  all  over  /lie  world  as  the  beauty  expert  of  Hollywood.  For  the  past  five  years  she  lias  been  making  the  stars  lovely  and  has  received  as  high  as  $100  a  treatment.  For  a  year  now  this  masseuse  de  luxe  has  been  teaching  the  readers  of  Photoplay  how  to  do  for  them-  selves exactly  what  she  has  done  for  the  stars.  Photoplay  is  the  only  magazine  to  which  she  has  revealed  these  secrets.   Read  and  heed  what  peppy  little  Sylvia-  has  to  say  to  you,  and  remember,  if  you  were  not  one  of  her  faithful  followers  this  last  year  in  Photoplay,  copies  of  the  mag-  azine arc  still  available  to  you.  At  the  end  of  this  article  you  will  find  a  resume  of  her  various  articles.   Send  for  any  or  all  of  these  magazines  and  let  Sylvia  make  you  beautiful.    Here  is  Sylvia  relaxing  Alice  White  by  pressing  hard  and  digging  deep  under  that  bone  at  the  hairline  about  an  inch  from  the  ear.  Do  this  yourself,  using  both  hands.   Wonderful  for  nerves    In  your  daily  living,  get  to  bed  before  twelve  o'clock  as  often  as  you  can — for  the  sleep  before  midnight  is  real  beauty  sleep.  But — don't,  for  heaven's  sake,  lie  in  bed  in  the  mornings  no  matter  how  late  you  have  gotten  to  bed.  Get  yourself  out  of  bed  and  get  the  blood  circulating.  The  people  who  stay  in  bed  late  are  sulky  and  cross  all  day  long  and  the  reason  they  are  sulky  is  because  they  hate  themselves  for  being  so  weak  and  lying  in  bed.   Don't  find  fault  with  other  people — there  are  plenty  of  things  about  yourself  you  can  find  fault  with  and  when  you're  always  looking  for  faults  in  other  people  your  face  grows  ugly  with  frowns.    Fortunate,  indeed,  that  Alice  White  at  left  is  labeled.  You'd  certainly  never  think  she  was  the  same  dainty  Alice  at  right.  We  suspect  Alice  of  hiding  a  very  heavy  waistline  behind  that  sign.  Notice  the  change  in  the  facial  expression  and  contour  when  the  figure  is  slim  and  lithe    When  you've  finished  dinner  at  night,  don't  flop  down  in  an  easy  chair.  This  is  one  of  the  worst  things  you  can  do.  In-  stead, walk  around  the  room — if  you  don't  feel  like  walking  outdoors — for  at  least  fifteen  minutes.  But  stay  on  your  feet  and  move  around  after  you've  eaten  a  heavy  meal.  Of  course,  I  don't  expect  you  to  eat  a  heavy  meal.  But  walking  after  meals  makes  your  food  digest.   Don't  be  induced  to  have  highballs  after  dinner.  Let  the  other  folks  have  them,  if  they  must,  but  you  take  a  tomato  juice  cocktail  instead.  And,  above  all  things,  don't  ever  ap-  pear bored  with  the  people  you're  with.  You  can  always  find  something  in  a  conversation  that  will  interest  you,  and  even  if  you  can't,  pretend  to  be  interested.  If  you're  bored,  your  face  will  show  it,  and  a  bright  expression  is  one  of  the  keynotes  of  beauty.   NOW  a  word  to  you  girls  who  work  in  offices.  Don't  feel  sorry  for  yourself  because  you  have  to  earn  a  living.  It's  the  best  thing  in  the  world  for  you — getting  out  in  the  world,  having  to  face  problems,  having  to  get  up  in  the  morning.  It  makes  your  mind  active  and  keeps  you  young.  And  no  matter  how  tedious  your  task  is,  be  alert  on  your  job.   And  don't— here  is  one  of  the  biggest  don't's  of  all — don't  slump  over  your  desk.  It  will  give  you  a  lump  on  the  back  of  your  neck,  sloping  shoulders  and  a  sagging  abdomen.  Sit  up  straight  as  you  work  and  you'll  discover  that  you'll  feel  much  better  at  the  end  of  the  day.   At  noon  don't  run  down  to  the  drug-store  and  get  a  dry  sandwich  and  a  chocolate  malted  milk.  Oh,  I  know  how  you  girls  do!  This  sort  of  food  gives  you  an  ugly  complexion  and  makes  you  fat.  After  all,  most  girls  who  work  are  given  an  hour  for  lunch.  Use  that  hour  to  eat  properly.  And  don't  order  the  same  things  every  day.  Use  some  imagination  in  selecting  your  food.  After  lunch,  walk  around  the  block  before  you  go  back  to  your  desk.  Don't  loiter  over  the  table  talking  to  your  friends.  Get  right  up,  as  soon  as  you've  finished,  and  start  your  liver  working  by  a  little  exercise-  it  will  give  you  pep  for  the  rest  of  the  afternoon.   I  know  a  lot  of  girls  who  feel  the  need  for  some  sort  of  stimu-  lant in  the  afternoon — so  they  send  to  the  drug-store  for  a  soda  or  some  concoction.  Instead,  drink  orange  juice  or  tomato  juice.     You'll  feel  much  better  for  it.

For  several  weeks  now  every  studio  in  Hollywood  has  been  testing  young  men  for  brawn,  bulk  and  bravery.  Brains?  Well,  of  course,  if  the  aspirant  surprises  the  director  with  intelligence,  so  much  the  better.    That  is  all  to  the  good.   The  studios  don't  count  on  it,  for  even  in  Hollywood  you  can't  expect  too  much,  so  it's  not  held  against  him.   The  present  attack  started  with  Johnny   (Tarzan)  Weissmuller.     When  that  young  man  left  his  Sunday  trousers  at   the  old  swimming   hole,   tied   a   kerchief  around  his  middle,  and  took  up  life  in  the  big  trees,  several    hundred    thousand    women    in    these    United  States,  and  foreign  parts  as  well,  went  home  and  cast  an  all-seeing,  critical  and  disapproving  eye  over  the  form  of  their  helpmate  and  the  next  night  dashed  right  back  out  to  the  nearest   picture   theater   to   sit   through   another   showing   of  "Tarzan."   It  wasn't  quite  fair.  In  fact,  I  call  it  a  lowdown  trick  to  spring  this  Weissmuller  fellow  on  the  rest  of  the  male  popula-  tion. The  depression  these  last  few  years  has  been  bad  enough,  without  having  that  kind  of  competition  floating  around  in  the  picture  houses.   But  the  mischief  is  done,  and  the  public  is  clamoring  for  more  Tarzans.   Every  studio  hopes  they've  got  one.   72    Johnny  Weissmuller  is  a  statue  in  bronze.  He  will  appear  in  another  ape  man  film,  "Tarzan  and  His  Mate"    Paramount  cast  Buster  Crabbe  for  this  role  in  "King  of  the  Jungle,"  for  he  com-  bines"brawnandpersonality"    RKO-Radio  told  Joel  McCrea  that  despite  the  fact  he  is  the  best  looking  man  in  dinner  clothes  in  Hollywood,  he'd  be  hand-  somer still  if  he  went  native.  Joel  is  hard  to  convince  about  his  own  assets;  doesn't  think  he  is  so  much,  but  he  respects  his  bosses  and  wants  to  please  them.  And  the  studio,  just  to  prove  their  argument,  took  away  his  tweeds  and  tuxedo  and  gave  him  a  bit  of  apron  in  the  "Bird  of  Paradise."   Joel  didn't  quite  measure  up  to  the  Weissmuller  perfection  of  figure  but  it's  only  by  comparison.  He'd  have  looked  one  hundred  per  cent  if  we  had  seen  him  first.   He  is  now  slated  for  a  jungle  lead  opposite  Katharine  Hep-  burn, who  has  two  very  excellent  [  please  turn  ro  page  102  ]    So  Hollywood  Goes  Oriental    WITH  Helen  Hayes  playing  a  little  Chinese  "Son-  Daughter"  and  Sylvia  Sidney  (at  left)  a  shy  Jap-  anese "Madame  Butterfly,"  is  Hollywood  beginning  a  cycle  of  romantic  Oriental  films?

Startling,  sensational,  if  you  like,  but  oh,  so  ultra-civilized !    Those  stars  who  were  not  busily  fixing  up  blue  bassinets  were  very  pleasantly  telling  it  to  the  judge.   In  1932,  there  were  thirty-four  divorces  among  the  most  prominent  film  folk.  That  outnumbers  the  marriages.  Cupid,  it  seems,  wasn't  half  so  popular  as  the  divorce  judge.   Still,  the  stars  do  know  how  to  give  the  little  fellow  a  friendly  good-bye  kiss  —  a  lingering  kiss.  They  do  it  with  aplomb,  with  a  sort  of  super-technique.  A  picture  luminary,  glowing  like  a   schoolgirl,  tells  you  breathlessly,  "  Oh,  my  dear!  I  was  divorced  yesterday.  And  what  do  you  think?  This  morning  my  sev-  ered-half  sent  me  a  corsage  of  orchids  and  asked  me  to  dine  with  him  tonight.     Isn't  it  too  thrilling?"   Ah,  maybe  so,  maybe  so.  Perverse  fate  quite  frequently  casts  a  halo  around  ex-husbands.  Anyway,  they're  mighty  handy  to  call  in  for  a  fourth  at  bridge  at  the  last  moment,  to  balance  up  your  check-book  and  things  like  that.   IT  doesn't  seem  so  very  long  ago  that  Greta  Nissen,  with  tears  in  those  blue,  blue  eyes,  pleaded,  "Oh,  isn't  ithere  some  way  to  stop  those  terrible  headlines  in  this  morning's  paper —  they  say  that  Weldon  and  I  are  parting!  It's  so  absurd.  You  see,  he  went  deep-sea  fishing  and  told  me  to  attend  a  party  without  him.  I  went  there  alone,  naturally — and  left  alone.  And  now  come  these  headlines!"   Apparently,  thoughts  of  a  break-up  were  furthest  from  Greta's  mind  that  day — yet  here  she  is,  determined  to  be  one  of  the  newest  of  filmdom's  dazzling  divorcees.   "Unsuitable  temperaments,"  they  explained  to  the  press.  And  to  their  intimates,  "  We're  parting  the  very  best  of  friends  and  with  much  regret.  "   Yet,  the  other  night  at  the  Cocoanut  Grove,  who  do  you  suppose  was  dancing  with  the  lovely  Greta?  Why,  Weldon  Heyburn,  of  course!    Adolphe  Menjou  and  Kathryn  Car-  ver traveled  fourteen  thousand  miles  to  recapture  romance.  A  last  gallant  gesture  to  love.  They  retraced  the  honeymoon  trail  they  took  five  years  before.  In  Avignon  they  even  occu-  pied the  same  suite  of  rooms  they  had  on  their  honeymoon.  There  was  moon-  light, too,  flooding  the  famous  old  bridge  and  the  balcony  below  their  windows.   But  it  didn't  work.  So  they  went  to  Paris  and  drank  a  farewell  toast  to  their  wedded  bliss.  Drank  it  in  the  Cafe  du  Dome  in  the  heart  of  the  Latin  quarter  where  they  had  spent  so  many  gay  hours.  Then  they  said  "quits."  Quietly,  definitely.   AND  there's  Maurice  Chevalier,  oo-  la-la!  Scandal-mongers  had  been  trying  to  separate  him  from  that  attrac-  tive little  Yvonne  Vallee  for  years  with-  out any  sign  of  success.  They  were  so  devoted,  apparently  so  much  in  love.  When  they  left  parties  early,  as  they  invariably  did,  you'd  hear  people  say,  "What  a  charming  pair — so  awfully  married. "   Just  before  Yvonne  left  in  the  spring  they  dined  at  Bill  Hart's  and  you'd  never  have  suspected  their  matrimo-  nial barque  had  sprung  a  leak.   But  it  had.     Yvonne  knew  it  when    Adolphe  Menjou  and  Kathryn  Carver  tried  to  recapture  ro-  mance by  retracing  the  honey-  moon  trail — but  it   was   no   go    Even  a  baby  daughter  could  not  re-fuse  the  broken  love  chain  of  Nils  Asther  and  Vivian  Duncan.

When  Maurice  arrived  everything  was  re  his  comfort.  He  told  the  press,  "Mrs.  Chevalie  have  reached  an  agreeable  understanding."  Yvonn  so  sure  of  that  at  first.   "  She  never  liked  Hollywood  and  never  was  hap^  I  have  learned  to  care  for  it  greatly,"  he  said  late   "I  was  happy  wherever  he  was,"  she  counten  before  any  French  fireworks  started  they  talked  o>  divorce — in  the  house  that  had  sheltered  their  gre'  ness.  Perhaps  it  had  a  softening  influence.  Cer  did  away  with  bitterness,  because  Maurice  and  have  been  seen  dancing  together  since.  And  what  dancing  in  the  supper  club  iv/icre  Misti)igucttc  was  h   FOR  years  Maurice's  name  had  been  linked  by  all  with  the  lady  of  the  "million  dollar  legs"  who  h  him  to  fame.    And  the  gossipers  wondered  if  Mau  visits  there  while  his  marital  knot  to  Yvonne  was  t  untied  signified  a  rekindling  of  an  old  flame.   While  self-constituted  Parisian  "matchmakers'  again  seeing  Chevalier  as  the  Continental  charmer's  s1  it  has  been  rumored  here  that  he  would  marry  Jeanette  Mac-  Donald.  Jeanette  scoffs  at  this,  saying  her  engagement  to  her  manager,  Bob  Ritchie,  is  very  much  on.  Other  rumors  have  circulated  to  the  effect  that  Maurice  is  madly  devoted  to  this  or  that  charming  lady  of  the  screen.  Speculations  are  rife  as  to  who  will  be  the  next  chatelaine  chez  Chevalier'.  But  Maurice  gives  his  characteris-  tic shrug,  smiles  enigmatically  and  murmurs,  "Qui  suit?"  And,  while  we're  trying  to  fig-  ure it  out,  he  continues  sending  roses  to  Yvonne.   A  debonair  divorce  was  Ruth    T    R   ont   noncha.i.   year.

Let  them  see  you."  That's  what  John  Barrymore  kept  whispering  in  Katharine  Hepburn's  ear  as  they  began  their  scenes  in  "A  Bill  of  Divorcement."   Sounds  funny,  doesn't  it,  coming  from  a  Barrymore?  Especially  John,  that  veteran  scene-stealer.  I  wouldn't  have  believed  it,  if  Katharine  Hepburn  herself  hadn't  told  me.  How,  in  those  parts  where  he  grips  her  shoulders  and  begs  her  to  help  him  "go  slow" — scenes  that  by  every  right  belonged  to  him — he  had  deliberately  and  forcibly  turned  her  towards  the  camera,  so  the  audience  would  be  con-  scious of  her.   That  audiences  everywhere  were  acutely  conscious  of  Katha-  rine Hepburn  as  a  dynamic  new  screen  personality  is  now  a  matter  of  motion  picture  history.  Never  has  Photoplay  re-  ceived more  letters  praising  a  first  screen  performance.   Katharine  is  the  only  one  of  her  family  who  has  had  any  contact  with  stage  or  screen.  At  eight  years  she  wrote  and  pro-  duced her  own  version  of  "Beauty  and  the  Beast,"  in  which  she  played  the  Beast  with  more  force  than  finesse.  She  had  a  puppet  theater,  too.  But  no  one  in  the  family  took  these  early  efforts  seriously.   They  sat  up  a  little  straighter,  however,  when  while  hardly  more  than  a  school-girl  and  without  "pull,"  training  or  expe-  rience, she  got  a  two-weeks  engagement  with  a  stock  company  in  Baltimore.  Then  she  secured  the  leading  feminine  role  in  the  play,  "The  Big  Pond."  It  went  to  Broadway  after  the  try-  out  performance,  but  without  Katharine.  Perhaps  they  were  afraid  to  trust  a  leading  part  to  an  unknown  actress.   Arthur  Hopkins,  the  producer,  saw  her  in  the  try-out  and  offered  her  a  small  part  in  the  Broadway  production  of  "These  Days."  It  lasted  only  seven  days.  Her  next  stage  venture  was  in  "Holiday,"  in  which  she  had  a  small  part  and  under-  studied Hope  Williams  in  the  leading  role.  Miss  Williams'  vitality  never  waned,  so  no  golden  opportunities  for  overnight  fame  came  Katharine's,  way.   During  this  period  she  studied  dancing  with  the  famous  Mordkin  and  diction  and  voice  culture.   82    And  it  was  John  Barrymore  who  forced  a  newcomer  to  play  this  trick  against   himself    After  a  five-months  real  holiday  in  Europe,  there  was  another  holiday  in  her  life— "Death  Takes  a  Holiday."  She  played  it  out  of  town  four  weeks,  getting  good  notices  from  the  critics,  but  was  dropped  from  the  cast  when  it  reached  New  York.  Rose  Hobart  replaced  her  and  made  an  instant  hit.  Maybe  Katharine  would  have  done  the  same.  She'll  never  know.   She  next  played  in  a  Theater  Guild  production,  followed  by  "Art  and  Mrs.  Bottle,"  with  Jane  Cowl.    And,  then,  the  highly  successful  "The  Warrior's  Husband,"  starring  Katharine  Hepburn.   After  four  years  of  hard  work,  flops  and  disappoint-  ments, she  had  "arrived"  in  the  theater.   Radio  Pictures  signed  her  for  "A  Bill  of  Divorcement"  and  she  embarked  on  her  first  trip  to  Hollywood  with  well-chosen,  correct  clothes  to  stock  her  closet  and  the  comfortable  and  casually  chosen  clothes  she  enjoys  wearing.   IT'S  no  wonder  the  report  got  around  that  I  have  sixteen  million  dollars,"  she  says.  "They  thought  no  new  actress  would  dare  go  about  Hollywood  dressed  as  terribly  as  I  was,  without  that  backing.  I  like  to  sit  and  think  what  I  could  do  with  so  much  money.  It  whiled  away  the  long  evenings — those  evenings  when  Hollywood  left  me  to  my  own  devices."   That's  another  funny  story  she  .tells  on  herself.  She  had  decided  she  didn't  want  to  go  to  premieres  or  Hollywood  parties.  She  was  there  to  do  a  job,  and  she  wondered  how  she  could  make  the  necessary  social  excuses.   The  joke  was  certainly  on  her.  Not  one  note  of  regret  did  she  have  to  ponder  over.  Not  once  did  her  maid  have  to  lie,  "I'm  sorry,  but  Miss  Hepburn  isn't  in."  She  hadn't  "arrived"  in  Hollvwood  and  evidently  they  weren't  expecting  she  would!  She  did  spend  an  evening  at  Pickfair,  but  that  was  because  the  Fairbanks  and  she  have  mutual  friends  who  arranged  it.  _  .   Her  funniest  experiences  happened  on  the  day  of  her  arrival.  On  the  trip  from  New  York  a  steel  splinter  became  imbedded  in  her  eye.  The  folks  from  the  studio  met  her,  red-eyed  and  squinting  with  discomfort,  at  the  station.  They  took  one  look  at   her  long,   thick   red   hair,      [  please  turn  to  page  116  ]    Photoplay  Magazine  for  January,  1933  83   L<ordelia  JDiddle  ~tezzay . .  .vjordelia  Diddle  tune  ueato  oyer,  ller  skin  lovely  now  as  then  flow  does  she  care  lor  it  :    CORDELIA  BIDDLE  IN  1923,  when  she  was  pronounced  one  of  the  twelve  most  beautiful  women  in  America.

Some  New  Dishes  That  Cost  Next  To  Nothing    ANYONE  can  make  tasty  dishes  by  using  a  lot  of  expensive  ingredients,  but  it  takes  real  ingenuity  to  concoct  something  grand  out  of  almost  nothing!  And  better  still,  to  have  it  cost  amazingly  little.   Gloria  Stuart  insists  that  com-  petitive spirit  plunged  her  into  cooking.  It  seems  that  Gloria  vacationed  some  time  ago  in  the  artists'  colony  at  Carmel-by-  the-Sea.  She  hadn't  been  there  long  when  she  discovered  you  weren't  given  much  of  a  hand  as  a  hostess  unless  you  could  offer  hungry  artists  unusual  dishes  for  a  few  paltry  cents.  The  tastier  and  cheaper  a  meal  was,  the  bigger  success  you  were.  So,  not  to  be  daunted,  Gloria  ceased  looking  at  a  stove  strangely,  and  worked  hard  at  the  cooking  idea  — the  results  were  beyond  her  wildest  expectations.  She  be-  came a  cooking  sensation.   With  praise  still  ringing  in  her  ears,  Gloria  returned  from  her  vacation  with  a  firm  resolve  to  conquer  Hollywood,  gastron-  omically  speaking!  It  seemed  everyone  was  eager  for  a  little  kitchen  economy  in  the  movie  colony  as  well  as  in  the  artists'  colony,  so  Gloria's  recipes  have  become  a  household  word  among  the  stars.   Try  some  of  Gloria's  success-  ful and  inexpensive  dishes.  Then  start  concocting  some  of  your  own  from  odds  and  ends  or  left-  overs. It's  twice  as  exciting  and  even  more  gratifying  than  to  cook  with  little  regard  for  the  cost.   Beet  Soup   Did  you  ever  think  of  using  beets  for  a  delicious  soup?

Peel  five  beets  while  still  freshly  cooked,  put  them  in  with  the  stock.  Cut  up  one  large  onion  and  some  parsley,  add  to  the  beef  stock  after  the  blood  is  all  out  of  the  beets  and  the  soup  is  a  dark  red  color.  Strain,  then  season  after  it  is  strained.   Did  you  ever  hear  of  using  Marigold  leaves  to  flavor  your    Just  try  to  stump  Gloria  for  supper  unexpectedly,  kitchen  and  concoct  one  of    soup?  Gloria  says  it  is  delicious  in  her  beet  soup.  Just  sprinkle  them  in  the  soup  and  remove  just  before  the  soup  is  ready  to  serve.  Adding  finely  grated  cheese  also,  adds  a  certain  zest  with  the  leaves.   Rolled  Steak   Is  the  meat  course  your  special  problem?  When  you  tire  of  all  the  regulars,  try  the  famous  Stuart  rolled  steak.  Take  a  strip  of  round  steak  about  six  inches  wide.

You  may  send  either  stamps  or  coin.    pound  it  for  you — then  make  this  dressing:  one  pound  of  pork  sausage,  one  cup  of  raw  chopped  spinach,  one  beaten  egg,  and  one-half  cup  of  bread  crumbs.  If  you  can't  stand  spinach,  it  can  be  eliminated  without  spoiling  the  taste.  Mix  this  dressing  together,  roll  it  into  the  steak  and  tie  it  up  at  both  ends  and  in  the  center.   Next  take  a  large  onion,  cut  into  small  pieces  and  saute  with  two  coarsely  grated  carrots  in  a  little  butter.  Then  pour  into  this  a  small  can  of  tomato  sauce  — just  enough  to  surround  the  steak.  Place  the  steak  in  this  mixture  and  cook  slowly  for  an  hour  or  more.  Do  not  remove  until  well  done.   Noodle  Supreme   This  is  Gloria's  chafing  dish  suggestion  for  after  theater  or  Sunday  night  supper  guests.  It's  the  filling  sort  of  dish  that  men  eat  heartily  and  it  has  a  tempt-  ing flavor.  Boil  noodles  in  salt  water  until  quite  tender.  Take  one  can  of  tuna  fish,  one  can  of  pimentos,  two  hard  boiled  eggs  and  one  small  can  of  mush-  rooms. Canned  mushrooms  are  quite  inexpensive,  so  they  won't  run  you  over  your  budget  price  on  this  dish!  Mix  all  the  in-  gredients together, after  chopping  the  pimentos  and  eggs.  Add  a  bit  of  chopped  green  pepper  and  a  bit  of  parsley.  Cover  all  with  a  smooth  white  sauce  into  which  has  been  stirred  a  cupful  of  grated  cheese.  Cook  slowly  for  fifteen  minutes  and  serve  hot.  This  can  be  served  on  toast  or  in  patty  shells.   Frolic   You  couldn't  possibly  guess  from  the  name  what  this  dish  is — but  it's  a  dessert!  It,  like  so  many  of  Gloria's  pet  recipes,  was  thought  up  in  an  emergency.  Guests  but  no  dessert—  you  know  the  feeling.     Well,  if  you  keep  a  package  of  dates,  a  jar   of  honey  and  a  box  of  graham  crackers  on  hand,  you  can  al-  ways make  Frolic.   Line  the  bottom  of  a  baking  dish  with  dates  in  a  layer.  Break  graham  crackers,  broken  into  bits  but  not  crumbled,  and  sprinkle  over  the  dates.  Build  a  layer  of  dates,  then  a  layer  of  crackers  until  the  dish  is  full.  Over  this  pour  honey  and  bake  in  a  slow  oven  for  a  half  hour.  Remove  from  the  oven  and  chill.  When  ready  to  serve,  slice  and  serve  it  with  a  topping  of  hard  sauce  or  whipped  cream.  And  these  four  cleverly  concocted  dishes  won  for  Gloria  the  gold  plated  sauce  pan  of  Hollywood!

OFTEN  in  these  columns  I  have  preached  the  gospel  of  change.  I  have  told  you  how  the  Hollywood  stars  find  new  charm,  beauty,  glamour  and  even  personality  through  change.  Change,  that  is,  of  costume,  coiffure,  make-up  and,  most  important  of  all,  mental  atti-  tude.   Karen  Morley  is  a  blonde  this  month,  a  brunette  next,  so  far  as  her  screen  appearance  is  concerned.  The  truth  is  that  Karen  has  fly-away  hair,  nice  as  hair  goes,  but  impossible  to  manage  for  the  camera.  So  she  resorts  to  wigs  and  changes  her  hair  more  frequently  than  any  other  actress.  And  notice,  you  never  tire  of  her.  You  always  expect  something  different  of  Karen — and  get  it.   /^HANGE  is  the  very  essence  of  life.  A  ^-'right  change  is  the  self-start  toward  all  the  good  things  of  life.  It  means  we  are  awake,  alive,  eager  to  try.   There  is  one  respect,  however,  in  which  I  would  discourage  change.  And  that  is  in  the  matter  of  your  beauty  care  when  you  have  dis-  covered satisfactory  preparations  for  your  skin,  hair,  nails  and  so  on.  After  all,  we  must  experiment  to  find  just  the  cream,  the  soap,  the  lotion,  that  is  right  for  us,  because  the  human  body,  like  our  appetites  and  tastes,  differs  in  the  individual.   So  when  you  find  a  cleansing  cream  that  leaves  your  skin  soft,  smooth,  clear,  adopt  it  for  your  very  own.   When  you  have  discovered  a  soap  that  is  right  for  you,  don't  forsake  it  in  the  hope  of  finding  another  more  fragrant  or  of  a  nicer  color.  And  so  on,  with  your  basic  prepara-  tions.   88    A  LL  reputable  beauty  preparations  of  to-  -*  *-day  are  manufactured  with  a  high  degree  of  skill  and  care.  So  if  you  find  a  cream  too  heavy,  that  leaves  your  face  too  creamy,  don't  condemn  that  cream  as  being  no  good.  It  is  probably  not  right  for  your  skin  but  ideal  for  another's.  The  selection  of  your  basic  prepara-  tions is  largely  a  matter  of  personal  taste.   Every  girl  with  a  fairly  normal  skin  needs  a  good  soap  for  face  and  bath,  a  cleansing  cream,  a  lotion  to  refresh  the  skin  and  remove  all  cream,  a  feeding  cream  to  use  about  the    WOULD  you  like  a  list  of  preparations  suitable  for  the  basic  purposes  mentioned  on  this  page,  worked  out  in  a  practical  budget  form?  have  it  ready  for  you  if  you'll  send  a  stamped,  self-addressed  envelope.

This  is  a  typical  group  of  basic  prepa-  rations, the  ones  we  would  all  do  well  to  stick  by  when  we  have  found  them  satisfactory.   Then  there  are,  of  course,  many  aids  to  good  grooming  and  good  looks — an  eyelash  grower,  acne  lotion  for  those  occasional  spots  that  will  appear  on  the  best  of  skins,  special  aids  for  other  skin  disorders,  an  effective  deodorant  and  bath  powder.   The  matter  of  make-up,  I  repeat,  is  alto-  gether different.  Rouge,  powder,  lipstick,  eye  make-up  constantly  change  for  the  better —  better  tones,  better  texture,  better  lasting  qualities.  By  changing  your  make-up  prepara-  tions often  you  will  find  many  pleasant  sur-  prises— both  in  yourself  and  in  them.   MARY  DUNCAN  tells  me  there  is  nothing  like  witch-hazelfor  renewing  eye  brilliance  after  a  fagging  day.  Take  small  squares  of  absorbent  cotton,  saturate  them  with  witch-  hazel,  eye  tonic,  eye  lotion  or  ice  water,  if  nothing  else  is  available,  press  lightly  over  the  eyes  and  lie  quietly  for  fifteen  minutes.   THE  vogue  for  bright  red  nail  polish  grows.  It  is  unusual  to  meet  anyone  from  Holly-  wood without  it.  The  "pale  hands,  pink-  tipped"  seem  mostly  in  the  discard.  We  have  all  been  trained,  I  think,  to  consider  our  cos-  tume in  relation  to  the  choice  of  nail  color,  but  most  of  us  fail  to  consider  the  tone  of  red  in  relation  to  our  skin.  If  you  are  a  brunette  you  will  find  a  warm  red  tone  far  more  flatter-  ing to  your  hands  than  a  cold  tone,  and  the  opposite    applies,   of   course,    to   fair   hands.

June  Elvidge  graced  the  cover  and  discoursed  on  clothes.  The  petite  Margue-  rite Clark  had  her  first  screen  in-  terview and  her  picture,  "Bab's  Burglar, "  was  reviewed.  Rich-  ard Barthelmess  was  her  new  hero  and  we  predicted  he  was  ''coming  to  the  front  rapidly."   In  the  gallery  were  the  pop-  ular Doris  Kenyon  and  Owen  Moore,  in  company  with  Blanche  Sweet,  Mrs.  Sidney  Drew,  Vivian  Martin  and  the  now  mourned  Bobby  Harron.   We  reviewed  "The  Woman  God  Forgot,"  with  Geraldine  Farrar  and  Wallace  Reid;  Theda  Bara's  "Cleopatra"  and  "Camille"  and  Billie  Burke's  "Arms  and  the  Girl''  with  Thomas  Meighan.  Billie  Burke  then  was  the  captivat-  ing comedienne,  a'  far  cry  from  her  recent  screen  return  as  the  woe-beset  wife  in  "A  B'H  of  Divorcement."   We  said  Theda  Bara  "makes  Camille  the    Marguerite  Clark    brazen  hussy,"  a  sharp  contrast  to  Lillian  Gish's  spirituelle  por-  trayal in  the  recent  Broadway  stage  revival.   A  picture  page  showed  D.  W.  Griffith  hobnobbing  with  English  noble  beauties  and  Premier  David  Lloyd  George,  on  his  jour-  ney abroad  to  get  authentic  war  scenes  and  the  sociological  effect  on  Britons  of  the  world  holocaust  for  "Hearts  of  the  World."   Bathing  beauties  of  the  day  warmed  this  winter  number.  Marie  Prevost,  Betty  Compson  and  Ann  Pennington  were  displayed  in  the  then  "daring  and  shocking"  bathing  attire.  The  merry  Marie  and  the  blonde  Betty  had  not  yet  been  elevated  to  feature  roles  demand-  ing more  in  modish  apparel.   Mothers  with  famous  film  children  were  pic-  tured, among  them  Alice  Joyce  and  Norma  Talmadge  with  their  fond  mamas.   Cal  York  item:  Theodore  Roberts  married  Florence  Smythe,  a  DeMille  actress.    10  Years  Ago    RUDOLPH  VALENTINO  struck!  In  his  signed  defense  the  romantic  Italian's  expressed  motives  were  quite  different  from  the  red-headed  Jimmy  Cagney's.  Rudy  wanted  more  money,  too,  but  principally  worth  while  stor-  ies. Offered  §7,000  a  week  (his  salary  had  been  $1,250)  Valen-  tino was  even  willing  to  take  the  old  figure  if  his  demands  were  met.   In  reviewing  his  [last  picture  before  his  strike,  "The  Young  Rajah,"  we  called  it  his  worst.  Charles  de  Roche  was  imported  to  replace  him.   Mr.  and  Mrs.  Douglas  Fairbanks  each  scored  with  outstanding  pictures,  Mary  Pickford  in  "Tess  of  the  Storm  Country"  and  friend  hus-  band with  "Robin  Hood."   The  other  photoplays  cited  for  distinction  were  "To  Have  and  To  Hold,"  with  Betty  Compson  highly  praised,  "Oliver  Twist"  featuring  Jackie  Coogan,  Wallace  Reid's  "Clarence"  and  "Enter  Madame"  starring  Clara  Kimball  Young.    Clara  Kimball  Young    The  foreign  invasion  was  on  Pola  Negri  was  pictured  domes-  tically ensconced  in  Hollywood.  And  there's  a  story  on  Emil  Jan-  nings  "An  American  who  can't  speak  English,"  as  he  was  born  in  Brooklyn  but  taken  to  Ger-  many while  a  child.   Alice  Brady  played  mannequin  for  the  latest  styles.  Lila  Lee  was  an  early  reducing  devotee,  the  camera  showing  her  before  and  after.   Douglas  Fairbanks  smiled  as   Robin  Hood  from  the  cover.    The   gallery  embraced  Marie  Prevost,  Mabel  Nor-   mand,  Agnes  Ayres,  Pauline  Starke,  Richard   Barthelmess  and  James  Kirkwood.   Pauline  Garon  became  DeMille's  first  blonde  heroine,  tripping  in  the  dainty  footsteps  of  those  beauteous  brunettes,  Gloria  Swanson,  Bebe  Daniels  and  Leatrice  Joy.   Cal  York  items:  The  rumor- relayers  pre-  dicted wedding  bells  for  Charlie  Chaplin  and  Pola  Negri,  Constance  Talmadge  and  Irving  Berlin  and  Rod  LaRocque  and  Mae  Busch.    5  Years  Ago    TN  "What  They  Want  Ten  ■•■Years  from  Now"  several  stars  wove  their  dreams.  Norma  Tal-  madge yearned  for  a  Riviera  villa,  children  and  the  stage.  Adolphe  Menjou  dreamed  of  being  a  French  country  gentleman.  Col-  leen Moore  wanted  two  children,  a  sailing  yacht  and  no  extra  pounds.  Richard  Barthelmess,  John  Gilbert  and  Richard  Dix  would  stay  in  pictures,  but  in  the  roles  of  producers.  Gloria  Swan-  son  had  stage  leanings.  Douglas  Fairbanks  hankered  for  travel  in  the  Orient.  Ronald  Colman  hoped  for  a  yacht,  first  editions  and  leisurely  stage  work.  Mae  Murray,  then  returning  to  the  stage,  wished  for  a  new  screen  career  in  her  own  productions.  Let's  see  if  1938  is  Santa  Claus  to  those  still  awaiting  realization  of  their  dreams.   The  cover  is  enhanced  by  Eleanor  Boardman  and  the  gailery  brightened  by  Greta  Garbo,  Kathryn  Carver,  then  Adolphe  Menjou's  fian-  cee, now  his  ex-wife;  Dorothy  Mackaill,  Myrna    Jeanne  Eagels    Loy,  Maria  Corda,  Mary  Nolan  and  Thelma  Todd.   Pictures  winning  review  lau-  rels were  Charlie  Chaplin's  "The  Circus,"  "Sorrel  and  Son,"  with  H.  B.  Warner  and  Anna  Q.  Nils-  son;  "The  Private  Life  of  Helen  of  Troy,"  presenting  the  foreign  Maria  Corda;  Douglas  Fairbanks  in  "The  Gaucho"  with  Lupe  Velez  as  his  new  leading  woman,  and  "Man,  Woman  and  Sin,"  starring  John  Gilbert  and  bring-  ing the  famous  Jeanne  Eagels  back  to  the  screen.  The  present  dramatic — yea,  tragic! — Joan  Crawford  lent  the  New  Year's  note,  so  flapper-  ish  under  the  mistletoe  in  a  photograph.  Quite  a  different  girl,  that  Joan,  from  today's  Sadie  Thompson  and  Letty  Lynlon.   Cal  York  items:  Leila  Hyams  married  Phil  Berg,  casting  agent;  Elsie  Janis  deserts  the  stage  to  become  a  scenarist,  and  Nils  Asther  buys  such  a  huge,  made-to-order  car  he  has  to  have  a  new  garage  built.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  January,  1933    Beauty  Is  Made  Not  Born   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  71  ]   And  here's  a  tip  for  your  complexion.  Don't  ever  dab  on  more  powder  and  rouge  with  a  dirty  puff  over  your  dirty  face.  Keep  some-  thing in  your  desk  to  cleanse  your  skin  before  you  put  on  extra  powder  and  rouge.  And  if  you  can't  find  time  to  clean  your  face  before  powdering,  then  don't  powder.  It's  better  to  go  around  with  a  shiny  nose  than  to  give  your-  self blackheads  and  whiteheads  by  powdering  over  a  dirty  face.   In  short,  girls,  what  I'm  trying  to  tell  you  all  is  to  lead  normal,  healthy,  happy  lives.  Health  and  happiness  reflect  themselves  upon  your  face.

Her  grand  work  has  won  her  a  host    of    followers    NSWER  MAN,  you  have  been  holding  out  on  us,"  many  little  girls  and  boys  "have  said  in  their  letters  this  month.  "Why  haven't  we  been  told  about  that  cute  little  Constance  Cummings  who  played  in  "Movie  Crazy"  and  "Washington  Merry-Go-  Round"?  Well,  if  you  youngsters  promise  to  sit  tight  and  listen,  I'll  give  you  the  low-down  on  Connie.   Her  first  baby  cry  was  heard  in  the  merry  month  of  May,  1910,  the  15th  to  be  exact.  She  is  5  feet,  4  inches  tall;  weighs  117  pounds  and  has  titian  hair  and  blue  eyes.   Although  Seattle,  Wash.,  her  birthplace,  is  separated  from  California  by  only  one  state  (do  I  know  my  geography?)  Connie  had  to  get  into  the  movie  colony  via  the  New  York  stage.  Samuel  Goldwyn  saw  her  on  the  stage  and  acclaimed  her  "a  find,"  but  Constance  landed  in  Hollywood  to  find  herself  without  a  a  job.  The  part  she  was  to  have  had  in  a  Ronnie  Colman  picture  had  been  rewritten  and  she  didn't  suit  the  new  script.  It  called  for  a  blonde  and  Connie  wouldn't  bleach  her  hair.  Other  studios  took  it  for  granted  that  she  lost  out  because  she  didn't  screen  well,  and  they  didn't  call  her  for  work.  She  was  just  about  ready  to  return  to  New  York  when  Columbia  offered  her  the  lead  in  "The  Criminal  Code,"  with  Walter  Huston.  Connie  proved  her  ability  as  an  actress  and  won  a  five  year  contract.   Her  real  name  is  Constance  Halverstadt,  but  she  took  Cummings,  her  mother's  maiden  name,  for  screen  purposes.  She  has  a  little  pup  she  calls  "Snoopy,"  and  I  wouldn't  mind  following  him  around,  that  is,  if  he  lives  up  to  his  name.   Mae,  San  Diego,  Calif. — Jimmy  Cagney  is  back  before  the  Kliegs  again,  after  playing  hookey  for  awhile.  He  is  making  "Hard  To  Handle"  a  story  about  press-agents.  Mary  Brian  is  his  leading  lady  and  will  probably  be  in  line  for  a  pair  of  good  old  Cagney  socks.  Bet  he  doesn't  get  away  with  that  at  home.

He  is  6  feet  tall,  weighs  155  pounds  and  has  brown  hair  and  hazel  eyes.  He  attended  Harlow  College  in  Essex,  Eng-  land. Was  on  the  New  York  and  London  stages  prior  to  entering  pictures  in  1928.  His  first  picture  was  "The  Letter"  with  the  late  Jeanne  Eagels.  After  that  he  returned  to  the  stage,  but  came  back  to  pictures  again  in  1931  in  "Secrets  of  a  Secretary"  with  Claudette  Colbert.  He  was  married  to  Edna  Best  on  November  26,  1928.  She  has  appeared  with  him  in  several  of  his  stage  successes  and  also  in  two  pictures  that  were  made  in  England,  namely  "Michael  and  Mary"  and  "Bachelor's  Folly."  Herbert's  latest  picture  is  "Trouble  in  Paradise."  Kay  Francis  and  Miriam  Hop-  kins appear  in  it,  too.  You'll  get  a  big  kick'  out  of  this  picture.  j   Tootsie,  Miami,  Fla. — That  mop  of  fuzz  that  sits  atop  Harpo  Marx's  head  is  just  a  wig.  And  a  red  one  at  that.  Did  you  know  that  Harpo  was  the  first  man  to  go  aloft  in  an  airplane  to  play  a  harp?  Just  getting  a  little  practice  for  the  hereafter.  Can  you  imagine  that  lad  with  wings?  '   Joe  Furxess,  Walla  Walla,  Wash. — ■  Sure,  Joe,  I  can  give  you  the  names  of  a  few  short  subjects.  Marion  Byron  and  Barbara  Kent,  just  4  feet,  11  inches;  Janet  Gaynor,  Sidney  Fox  and  Helen  Foster  just  reaching  the  five  foot  mark.  Who  said  that  shrimps  are  only  in  salad?   A.  T.,  Brooklyn,  N.  Y. — Oh,  yes,  Fifi  Dorsay  has  gone  back  into  pictures  after  a  successful  vaudeville  tour.  Her  latest  picture  is  "The  Girl  from  Calgary."  It's  the  story  of  a  girl  from  the  wide  open  spaces,  who,  with  the  aid  of  a  good  press-agent,  lands  on  the  Great  White  Way.  I  won't  tell  you  any  more.  See  it  for  yourself.  And  does  Fifi  sing  in  it?  Oo-la-la!  How  she  puts  over  those  tunes,  "Misbehaving  Feet,"  "Comme  ca  va"  and  "Maybe, -Perhaps.-"    And  this  is  George  Raft  who  is  looking  so  intently  at  Connie.  They  appear  together  in  Para  mount's  "Night  After  Night"    Mona,  Washington,  D.  C. — "What  ever  happened  to  that  little  freckle  faced  boy  Wesley  Barry?"  you  ask.  Well,  believe  it  or  not,  he's  waving  a  baton  (leading  an  orchestra,  in  case  you  don't  get  me)  in  the  New  Kenmore  Hotel  in  Albany.  But  don't  forget,  Wes  isn't  little  any  more.  He's  twenty-five  years  old  now.   Al  Shapre,  St.  Paul,  Minn. — In  the  silent  version  of  "Smilin'  Through,"  Wyndham  Standing  played  the  part  of  John  Carteret,  which  was  played  by  Leslie  Howard  in  the  talkie  version.  Kenneth  Wayne  was  played  by  Harrison  Ford  in  silents  and  by  Fredric  March  in  talkies.   M.  J.,  Buffalo,  N.  Y. — Glad  you  wrote  and  told  me  you  liked  my  page.  Ah  me!

What  a  long  way  he  has  come  since  then.  Joan  Crawford,  James  Murray,  House  Peters  and  Creighton  Hale  had  the  main  leads  in  "Rose  Marie."   Jane  Nelson,  Sax  Fraxcisco,  Calif.  —  Well,  Jane,  how  did  you  like  the  story  we  had  on  your  friend  Bing  Crosby  last  month?  As  long  as  you  are  so  interested  in  him,  here  are  his  measurements.  Weighs  165  pounds,  is  5  feet,  9  inches  tall  and  has  light  brown  hair  and  pastel  blue  eyes.  Studied  law  before  he  joined  Paul  Whiteman's  outfit.  His  real  name  is  Harry  L.  Crosby  and  he  is  married  to  Dixie  Lee,  blonde  movie  actress  who  has  deserted  the  screen.   George  Brent  is  a  native  of  Dublin,  Ireland.  He  was  born  there  on  March  15,  1905.  Is  6  feet,  1  inch  tall,  weighs  165  and  has  black  hair  and  hazel  eyes.  You  guessed  right  about  the  eyes,  Jane.  He  appeared  on  the  stage  for  eight  years  prior  to  entering  pictures  in  1930.  Was  married  to  Ruth  Chatterton  on  August  13,  1932.    His  first  wife  was  Helen  Campbell.   Albert  Wigc,  New  York  City. — You  were  a  little  twisted  on  the  title,  Al.  The  picture  was  called  "Whirlwind  of  Youth."  Lois  Moran  was  the  leading  lady  and  the  boys  who  supported  her  were  Donald  Keith,  Larry  Kent  and  Gareth  Hughes.  I  am  sure  Barry  Norton  would  be  pleased  to  know  the  numbers  of  loyal  followers  who  want  to  see  him  on  the  screen  again.   Beulah  Bothe,  San  Antonio,  Tex.  —  Thelma  Todd  just  used  the  name  of  Alison  Lloyd  in  one  picture.  That  was  "Corsair,"  made  in  1931.  The  Todd  name  was  so  well  known  to  movie-goers  that  Thelma  decided  to  stick  to  it.  In  private  life,  you  know,  she  is  Mrs.  Pasquale  de  Cicco.  She  was  married  last  July.

But  this  is  the  first  time  Mrs.  Johnny  Weissmuller  (Bobbe  Arnst)  has  started  the  gossipy- tongues  wagging.   He's  Wally  Reid's  son.  Fourteen  years  old,  you  know.  He  took  Bobbe  to  the  opening  of  his  mother's  play  in  his  famous  Ford,  titled  "Frozen  Assets"  and  treated  her  to  an  ice-  cream soda  afterwards.  And  when  Bobbe  went  to  San  Francisco  on  vaudeville,  he  telephoned  her  twice.  What  that  cost  his  school-boy  allowance!  Incidentally,  he  says,  "She  ain't  so  much  older  and  I'm  a  whole  lot  taller!"   T^TCK  ARLEN  is  rebuilding  his  house  at  ■^"'Toluca  Lake  by  his  own  labor.

BOB  MONTGOMERY  recently  de-  liberately turned  down  a  trip  to  Honolulu  with  her  famous  husband  to  visit  her  sister  in  New  York.  She  told  Bob,  who  went  over  there  with  the  "Pig  Boats"  company,  that  he  would  be  working  all  day  and  she  would  be  lonesome,  so  she  picked  shows  and  clothes  instead  of  ukuleles  and  grass  skirts.   XTORMA  SHEARER  and  Irving  Thalberg  have  made  it  unanimous  now.   Norma  has  always  been  an  expert  swimmer  and  diver,  and  the  swimming  pool  at  her  home  is  both  large  and  deep.  So  big  and  so  deep  that  the  little  Thalberg  baby  couldn't  even  play  in  the  shallow  end  of  it.  Now,  beside  the  big  pool,  there  is  a  little  pool  which  was  built  especially  for  the  baby,  while  the  big  one  has  been  screened  off  with  netting  so  that  there  can't  be  any  mistake  about  which  is  which.   Some  of  the  guests  might  make  a  mistake.

But  Bill  was  over  at  Catalina  Island,  on  location  for  "Fast  Life."  Did  that  stop  him?  It  did  not.  He  did  the  whole  job  by  telephone,  calling  up  the  shops  he  used  and  specifying  every  de-  tail so  exactly  that  the  result  was  just  as  per-  fect as  though  he'd  been  there  himself.   JOAN  BENNETT  and  baby  Adrienne  went  J  to  New  York  to  join  the  gathering  of  the  clan.  Sister  Barbara — Mrs.  Morton  Downey  — is  expecting  a  blessed  event.

TN  looking  over  a  notebook,  of  less  than  a  year  ago,  a  reporter  found  this  quotation  she  had  jotted  down  from  Jean  Harlow:  "I  am  too  busy  to  think  of  getting  married. "   This  was  during  the  making  of  "  Red-Headed  Woman. "   And  by  the  time  the  small  notebook  was  filled— Jean  Harlow  was  a  widow.  How  little  — how  very  little — we  can  tell  of  the  future.   COME  stills  of  "Night  After  Night"  were  ^mailed  from  the  Paramount  studios  in  Hol-  lywood to  their  New  York  office  and  not  know-  ing the  name  of  a  little  girl  in  the  background  of  one  of  the  stills,  they  simply  marked  her  Miss  X.

This  new  treatment  attacks  two  very  common  causes  of  skin  troubles — constipa-  tion and  a  nervous,  run-down  condition  due  to  the  shortage  of  vitamins  B  and  G  in  the  average  diet.  Yeast  Foam  Tablets  correct  these  conditions  because  they  contain  rich  stores  of  these  vitamins  which  strengthen  the  digestive  and  intestinal  organs,  which  give  tone  and  vigor  to  your  nervous  system.

Few  peo-  ple get  enough  of  these  vital  elements  for  max-  imum health.  Exami-  nation by  a  medical  au-  thority of  the  dietary  histories  of  over  500  persons  under  his  care  revealed  a  remarkable    shortage  of  these  essential  nutritive  factors.  Remember,  in  many  of  our  most  common  foods  vitamins  B  and  G  are  entirely  lacking.

Mary  Boland,  who  yearned  to  play  Juliet,  excelled  in  Mrs.  Malaprop  roles  on  the  stage  and  is  now  a  first-  class  movie  comedienne.  After  thirty  years  of  stage  trouping,  Alison  Skipworth  brings  her  sly  wink  and  rich  comedy  sense  to  motion  pictures,  to    give    us    such    grand    characterizations    as    "Madame    Racketeer"    baby  was  up,  arriving  home  after  it  was  asleep.

Our  "most  engaged"  director  (Doro-  thy Sebastian,  Mona  Maris,  etc.)  seems  very  serious  about  Alice  Joyce,  and  friends  tell  us  he  is  impatient  that  Alice's  divorce  from  Mr.  Regan  become  final.   TX7ILL  ROGERS  blames  it  all  on  the  flip  of  a  coin.   His  recent  trip  to  South  America  brought  out  the  story.   Once,  years  ago,  he  was  in  the  Argentine,  broke.   He  debated  whether  he  should  go  to  Africa  on  a  mule  boat  or  try  to  work  his  way  back  home  to  Oklahoma.   He  nipped  a  coin  and  the  coin  said  "Africa.

When  he  played  with  Bebe —  or  perhaps  we  should  say  when  Bebe  played  with  him  since  he  is  now  a  star — in  "Honor  of  the  Family,"  she  taught  Warren  fencing  in  which  she  is  an  expert.  Warren  liked  the  game  but  it  was  difficult  to  find  someone  to  play  with  him.  So  he  got  an  iron  man,  one  who  strikes  back  and  everything.  Warren  always  wins,  of  course.  Which  makes  this  arrangement  an  ad-  vantage.   A  ND  now  they've  got  a  Joe  E.  Brown  mug  out.  No,  not  commercial.  Just  a  gag  in  Joe's  honor.  And  was  he  pleased!  He  didn't  care  that  an  entire  mug  was  formed  in  imita-  tion of  his  yawning  mouth.  And  he  insists  upon  drinking  from  the  one  sent  to  him.  You  see,  his  mouth  and  the  mug  just  fit.   TvTOW  that  she  has  returned  to  Broadway  and  the  stage,  we  can  break  down  and  tell.  Those  shouts  of  mirth  emanating  from  Ethel  Barrymore's  dressing-room  at  M-G-M  were  from  the  select  and  exclusive  audience,  comprised  mostly  of  John  and  Lionel,  who  were  privileged  to  witness  Ethel's  imitations  of  Hollywood  celebrities.

A  COLD  ordinarily  progresses  through  three  stages:  The  Dry  Stage,  the  first  24  hours;  the  Watery  Secre-  tion Stage,  from  1  to  3  days;  and  the  Mucous  Secretion  Stage.  Once  a  cold  gets  beyond  the  first  stage  it  is  far  more   difficult  to  relieve.  In  fact,  to  let  a  cold  run  beyond  the  first  stage  is  frequently  courting  danger.

It  relieves  the  headache  and  grippy  feeling.  It  tones  the  entire  system  and  fortifies  against  further  attack.   That  is  the  treatment  you  want — com-  plete, thorough  and  effective.  Anything  less  is  toying  with  a  cold.   Grove's  Laxative  Bromo  Quinine  is  absolutely  safe  to  take.  It  contains  no  narcotics  and  produces  no  bad  after-  effects. Every  drug  store  in  America  sells  Grove's  Laxative  Bromo  Quinine.

He  got  off  the  train  lugging  a  huge  turtle  named  Elmer  the  Great,  which  Joe  says  is  a  highly  intelligent  turtle  and  will  be  doing  tricks  in  no  time,  once  he  puts  his  mind  to  it.   He  has  encountered  a  little  difficulty  in  the  fact  that  every  time  he  begins  a  lesson,  Elmer  pulls  his  head  in  and  closes  up  shop.  Now  Joe  wants  to  know  how  you  can  tell  when  a  turtle  is  paying  attention.   T_TA!  Thought  there  was  a  catch  in  it  when  •^■Bill  Wellman  started  directing  Ruth  Chat-  terton  with  his  hair  combed.   Bill  has  been  sailing  around  for  years  with  a  coiffure  that  looked  as  if  it  had  been  arranged  with  an  egg-beater.  If  he  owned  a  hat  he  kept  it  a  dark  secret,  and  his  shirts  apparently  were  made  with  no  top  button.   Then  he  went  to  work  on  the  Chatterton  epic,  and  la  Chatterton  influence  extended  to  Wellman's  hair — and  his  top  button.  He  proved  that  he  had  a  necktie  and  a  comb  .  .  .  for  the  first  week.  It  took  just  that  long  for  Mr.  Wellman  and  Miss  Chatterton  to  become  buddies,  and  the  Wellman  pompadour  to  re-  turn to  its  own.  His  neck  is  out  in  the  air  again.  .  .  .  But  it  took  a  Chatterton  to  get  it  buttoned  up,  even  for  a  week.   "pOR  the  first  time  in  the  history  of  the  movies,  stunt  men  are  going  to   be  given  screen   credit  in  "Heroes  for  Hire,"  which  is  as  it   should  be.   About  the  only  time  the  name  of  a  stunt   man  gets  into  print  is  when  his  obituary  is   read  in  the  papers.   But  now,  all  that's  to  be  changed.    And  the   boys  with  the  iron  nerves  and  do-or-die  spirits,   are  going  to  get  their  names  right  along  with   the  stars.   C  OMEONE  asked  Nils  Asther  if  he  Splayed  golf.   "Well,  it  is  practically  the  same  thing.  Only  I  play  it  on  a  horse,"  Nils  answered  with  all  seriousness.   /"""URLS,  I  believe  it's  a  grand  scheme,  this  ^^one  of  Gwili  Andre's.  You  see,  Gwili's  life  is  a  busy  one  and  she  really  hasn't  the  time  to  spend  in  a  gymnasium  that  she  should  to  keep  that  figure,  so  what  do  you  think  the  luscious  Gwili  does?  Once  a  month  she  gets  a  phono-  graph record  from  her  physical  instructor  with  all  her  exercises  on  it.  Each  morning,  for  fifteen  minutes,  she  follows  instructions  on  the  record  and  at  the  end  of  the  month,  has  a  new  one  made,  with  new  exercises.    Not  bad,  eh?   JACKIE  COOPER  came  into  a  M-G-M  pub-  -'  licity  office  the  other  day,  where  several  writers  were  gathered  and  Jackie  was  inclined  to  be  just  a  bit  show-offy  and  unnatural.  After  saying  goodbye,  he  came  tearing  back  into  the  office,  asked  to  be  excused  while  he  whispered  something   into   the   publicity   woman's  ear.    After  he'd  left  again,  the  publicity  woman  ex-  plained that  Jackie  whispered  he  realized  he'd  been  a  bit  smart  and  he  was  very  sorry  and  to  please  explain  how  badly  he  felt.  So  you  see,  there's  not  much  danger  of  Master  Cooper  go-  ing haywire  for  many  a  day.   WAS  Director  Leo  McCarey embarrassed?  It  seems  he  was  giving  instructions  to  a  large  group  of  extras  on  "The  Kid  From  Spain"  set.   "Now  don't  clap  as  the  bull  comes  in — "  he  began.   "Mr.  McCarey,"  an  extra  shouted  from  the  back  row.   "Keep  quiet  until  I'm  through,"  the  di-  rector said  and  went  on  with  elaborate  in-  structions.   "Mr.  McCarey,"  the  extra  called  again.   "Listen,"  the  director  said.  "Will  you  keep  quiet  until  I'm  through?"   And  for  ten  minutes  more  he  explained  what  he  wanted  in  the  scene.   Then  turning  to  the  extra  in  the  back  row,  called:   "Now,  what  was  so  important  that  you  had  to  keep  interrupting  me?"   "Oh,  nothing  much,"  the  extra  called  back.  "I  just  wanted  to  tell  you  we  couldn't  hear  a  word  you  said,  back  here."   A    CERTAIN  actress  had  gone  to  New  York   ^  for  a  visit  and  left  her  attractive  husband  behind.  Becoming  a  bit  uneasy,  she  phoned  the  butler  (the  one  she  had  hired)  and  asked  casually,  "How's  everything,  Jeffers?"   "Oh  splendid,  miss,  splendid,"  he  replied.   "Any — er — parties,  Jeffers?"   "Well,  I  have  noticed  several  glasses  scat-  tered about,"  Jeffers  said,  "but  madam,  I  ex-  amined all  the  cigarettes  and  none  had  lip  rouge  on,  so  it's  all  right. "   D  EMEMBER  "Poor  Pauline"?  You're  soon  to  see  her  again.  P"or,  believing  that  serials  are  packing  more  and  more  of  a  thrill  at  the  box-office,  Carl  Laemmle,  Jr.,  has  just  bought  "The  Exploits  of  Elaine"  and  "The  Perils  of  Pauline  "  to  be  remade  into  talkies.   Now  he's  looking  for  a  serial  queen  to  be-  come the  modern  Pearl  White  and,  among  other  specifications,  her  shoulder-blades  have  to  fit  the  railroad  tracks.   T\  7H0  said  Hollywood  is  entirely  selfish?  There  is  plenty  of  proof  to  the  opposite  and  young  Doug  Fairbanks,  Jr.,  has  proved  it.  Doug  has  had  the  same  stand-in  for  several  years.  Lately  the  boy's  eyes  became  affected  by  the  lights  and  his  sight  was  threatened.  Immediately  young  Doug  rushed  him  to  the  hospital,  secured  the  best  doctors,  and  not  only  footed  all  the  bills  but  stayed  with  the  lad  all  night  until  every  danger  was  passed.

Paramount  has  tested  every  young  man  of  athletic  proportions  and  prowess  in  Holly-  wood for  the  Lion  Man  in  "The  King  of  the  Jungle,"  and  the  final  choice  falls  on  Buster  Crabbe,  a  member  of  the  Olympic  swimming  teams  of  1928  and  1932.   T_TE  is  no  runner-up,  this  lad.  Holds  five  *■  ■'-world  swimming  records  and  some  thirty  odd  national.  Hails  from  the  University  of  Southern  California.   Already  he  knows  the  real  danger  of  work-  ing in  wild  animal  pictures.  His  first  day's  labor  with  the  full-maned  king  of  the  jungle  drew  blood — Crabbe's.  The  gong  sounded,  they  gave  that  round  to  the  lion  and  sent  Buster  to  the  hospital  to  fix  up  a  partly  chewed  leg,  as  well  as  innumerable  scratches  and  bruises.   But  I  understand  he  was  able  to  report  for  further  adventure  shortly  after.   An  animal  trainer  explains  that  these  animals  are  not  accustomed  to  working  with  unclothed  people,  and  that  this  fact  makes  them  very  dangerous.   With  Weissmuller  starting  a  sequel  to  "Tarzan,"  with  Georges  Carpentier,  France's  gift  to  the  ringside,  being  treated  daily  for  voice  and  vigor,  with  the  cast  of  Paramount's  "Island  of  Lost  Souls"  boasting  enough  Greek  wrestlers  to  support  the  Doric  columns  of  the  Parthenon,  we're  in  for  plenty  of  primitive  thrills  during  the  spring  of  1933.   I  am  not  considering  here  "The  Big  Cage,"  which  Universal  is  making  with  Clyde  Beatty,  the  finest  animal  trainer  I've  seen  since  I  stole  my  first  quarter  to  get  inside  a  circus.  I  imagine  this  will  be  more  of  a  "big  top"  picture  with  less  of  the  jungle  quality,  for  while  Beatty  is  a  clean-cut,  nice-looking  fellow,  he  doesn't  seem  particularly  adaptable  to  the  back-to-nature  idea.   I  heard  a  couple  of  youngsters  discussing  "Animal  Kingdom"  the  other  day.  RKO-  Radio  has  just  completed  this  story  of  marital  unhappiness  with  Ann  Harding  and  Leslie  Howard.   "  Gee,  won't  Ann  Harding  be  swell  in  the  jungle  with  that  long  hair  of  hers  hanging  down?  "  asked  one  of  them.   To  which  the  other  replied,  "Yeah,  but  I  don't  think  Leslie  Howard  is  big  enough  to  fight  the  animals,  do  you?  "   Let  this  be  a  fair  warning  to  RKO-Radio  that  they  had  better  change  that  title.  With  the  present  craze  for  animal  pictures  being  what  it  is.   EVERYTHING  travels  in  cycles,  and  that  is  no  less  true  in  entertainment  than  wearing  apparel.   We've  had  gangster  pictures  until  every  child  beyond  his  decrepit  age  of  six  years  can  rattle  off  the  argot  of  the  racketeer  like  waifs  from  "Hell's  Kitchen,"  and  we've  had  super-so-  phisticated-hot-house-dramas, heavy  with  ex-  aggerated sex,  until  we  know  all  there  is  to  know  about  life,  love  and  consequences,  so  a  primeval  romance,  chuck  full  of  thrills,  action  and  outdoor  beauty  like  "Tarzan,"  caught  us  on  the  rebound  and  we  toppled  like  ten  pins.   All  the  other  studios  will  now  be  accused  of  walking  in  sheep  tracks  again  by  turning  out  their  quota  of  jungle  operas  and  hoping  to  reap  the  harvest  that  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  did  with  "Tarzan,"  but  why  not?   When  a  certain  type  of  picture  is  an  over-  whelming success  it  is  an  indication  of  which  way  the  public  wind  is  blowing.  Not  that  a  good  story,  well  made,  is  not  a  success  at  any  stage  of  the  evolution.     It  will  always  win    favor,  but  if  it  happens  to  be  released  at  the  exact  psychological  moment,  as  we  scientists  say,  so  much  the  better.   I  doubt  that  "Tarzan"  would  have  been  the  hit  in  1927  or  '28  that  it  was  in  1932.   Back  then  we  were  palpitating  over  "Danc-  ing Daughters,"  close-shingled  hair,  skirt  lengths  above  the  knee,  and  what  not.   Our  heroes  were  exponents  of  incendiary  romances  and  cellophane  passion,  which  was  fine  while  it  lasted,  but  if  the  tastes  of  the  public  have  swung  around  to  adventure,  Vic-  torian love-making  and  thrills,  let  them  have  it  until  they  are  ready  for  something  else.   I  have  sat  through  a  dozen  arguments  over  luncheon  tables  as  to  whether  the  picture  "Tar-  zan" would  have  been  just  as  much  a  success  with  any  one  of  a  number  of  other  young  actors  in  the  Weissmuller  part.  Certainly  it  would  have  been,  provided  we  had  not  pre-  viously seen  him  on  the  screen  and  provided  he  fitted  the  requirements  physically.  Only  a  newcomer  could  have  been  the  slightest  bit    Lon  Chaney's  big  boy,  Creighton,  caught  signing  his  famous  surname  to  the  register  at  the  N.  V.  A.  benefit.  Creighton  is  going  to  work  on  a  new  picture  called  "Heroes  for  Hire,"  glorifying  the  daredevil  stuntmen    convincing  in  that  half-dumb,  half-human  part.   But  the  fact  that  Johnny  made  a  personal  hit  in  it  is  something  to  his  credit.  M-G-M  didn't  expect  him  to,  nor  did  he.  The  picture  was  all  that  counted  while  it  was  being  made,  but  his  magnificently  proportioned  physique  and  naive  freshness  caught  on.   From  time  to  time,  several  well-known  male  stars  of  the  screen  have  disclosed  bodily  structures  that  while  not  always  approaching  perfection  got  by  very  well  indeed.  Oh,  yes,  indeedy.   Ramon  Novarro  comes  to  mind  at  the  moment.     Through  many  years  of  acrobatic    dancing  he  has  developed  a  perfectly  superb  body  with  muscles  like  flexible  steel,  but  Ramon  stopped  growing  just  short  a  few  inches  of  an  ideal  height,  otherwise  he  would  head  the   class.   ■XTOST  of  the  leading  men  look  grand  in  ■'•"■'•clothes.  It's  one  of  the  requisites  of  a  screen  career,  like  eating  peas  with  your  fork,  but  it's  quite  another  matter  to  toss  away  your  civil-  ized garb  without  throwing  overboard  a  single  illusion.   Malibu  Beach  proves  that,  where  with  nothing  but  running  trunks  of  the  postage  stamp  variety  between  them  and  a  cruel  world,  male  forms  stalk  up  and  down.   Cast  your  eye  about.  Those  who  look  most  perfect  in  coat  and  trousers  are  slightly  thin  for  the  beach.  (That  goes  for  the  ladies,  too.)  A  few  are  becoming  pachydermatous  from  over-  development, others  show  tendency  to  bow-  legs from  too  much  horseback  riding — all  look  bronzed  and  healthy  but  not  so  many  Apollos  but  that  a  good  specimen  stands  out.   Let's  pass  the  laurel  leaf  to  one  who  earned  it.  Douglas  Fairbanks  was  the  original  knight  of  the  breech-cloth.   For  many  years,  Doug,  with  scarcely  more  on  his  person  than  a  garland  for  his  brow,  rescued  maidens  in  distress.  Scaling  walls,  leaping  from  roof  to  roof,  charging  through  impenetrable  forests,  with  the  fair  one  clinging  to  his  unbelievably  slim  waist.   But  now  Doug  seems  weary  of  the  chase.  After  all,  you  can't  keep  enthusiasm  at  fever  heat  indefinitely.  Repetition  dulls  the  most  ecstatic  emotion,  and  so  Doug  is  casting  slightly  tired  eyes  far  afield,  toward  cities  un-  explored and  paths  less  worn,  where  he  can  record  his  travel  experiences  with  a  camera  without  continuing  the  strenuous  physical  activities  of  his  earlier  years.   Strangely  enough,  very  few  famous  special-  ized athletes  have  ever  gotten  to  first  base  in  motion  pictures.   Thinking  back,  there  were  Charlie  Paddock,  Red  Grange,  Babe  Ruth,  Jack  Dempsey,  Gene  Tunney,  Duke  Kahanamoku;  all  took  a  stab  at  Hollywood  but  with  indifferent  success.   Weissmuller,  following  closely  on  Kahan-  amoku's  swift  heels  in  1928  as  a  world  cham-  pion swimmer,  cast  yearning  eyes  toward  the  land  of  promise  in  California,  but  no  one  gave  him  a  tumble.   A  few  football  players  have  done  fairly  well,  playing  small  parts  here  and  there,  the  most  notable  exception  being  Johnny  Mack  Brown  from  Alabama.  Johnny  got  off  to  a  whirlwind  start  but  has  slowed  up  a  bit  during  the  past  year.   One  reason  why  many  noted  athletes  have  failed  to  ring  the  gong  in  pictures  is  that  the  public  is  not  interested  in  them  as  actors  but  only  as  record-breakers.  Unless  the  young  man  has  an  unusual  personality  an  audience  sits  back,  bored  with  his  acting,  and  waiting  for  him  to  do  the  stunt  that  made  him  famous  and  usually  when  that  feat  is  accomplished,  finis  is  written  to  his  screen  career.   ON  the  other  hand,  very  few  athletes  are  natural  born  actors.  You'd  think  that  being  in  the  public  eye  would  develop  the  poise,  ego,  or  what  have  you,  necessary  for  camera  de-  portment, but  not  at  all.   Most  of  them  are  as  self-conscious  before  the  "mike"  as  an  1860  bride.   I've  heard  a  lot  of  discussion  about  these  fellows  who  become  sensational  front  page  copy  overnight  and  what  becomes  of  them  after  the  high  flush  of  victory  has  worn  off.   They  spend  years  of  training  to  build  a  per-  fect physical  machine  for  one  sport  or  another  — swimming,  football,  track — and  usually  at    102    ?    Photoplay  Magazine  for  January,  1933    103    the  neglect  of  other  faculties.  It's  a  whole  time  job  becoming  a  headliner  in  anything  these  days,  and  in  athletics  it  lasts  such  a  little  while.   There's  always  some  young  and  eager  lad  fast  on  your  heels  who  next  year  makes  the  headlines.   And  for  every  one  who  has  a  profession  to  turn  to  when  he  can  no  longer  crack  records  there  are  a  half  dozen  who  do  not.   You  can  only  cash  in  on  a  body  machine  when  it's  brand  new.   Second-hand  value  on  athletes  is  lower  than  on  an  early  vintage  Ford.   THIS  year  for  the  first  time  that  I  can  recall  a  lot  of  famous  names  from  last  year's  headlines  were  drafted  into  politics.  Albie  Booth,  Red  Cagle,  Eddie  Mays,  John  (Ship-  wreck) Kelly,  as  well  as  Gene  Tunney.   I  never  heard  any  of  these  young  men  speak,  and  maybe  they  surprised  everybody,  includ-  ing themselves,  but  remembering  this  last  polit-  ical controversy  it  seems  we  need  some  new  blood  in  that  field  about  as  badly  as  anywhere  I  can  think  of,  so  perhaps  that's  a  solution  for  some  of  the  fellows.   Weissmuller  has  yet  to  prove  himself  as  an  actor.  He  was  fortunate  in  "Tarzan"  that  there  were  no  demands  made  on  him  that  he  was  unequal  to.   At  this  writing,  Crabbe  and  the  others  are  not  far  enough  into  their  pictures  to  form  an  opinion  of  their  possibilities.   Joel  McCrea  had  won  his  spurs  before  they  started  disrobing  him,  so  he  didn't  muscle  in,  but  I  hear  tell  that  his  fan  mail  has  increased  prodigiously  since  "Bird  of  Paradise"  was  re-  leased.   BUT  if  these  juveniles  with  their  beauty  of  physique  can  demonstrate  that  they  can  also  make  sense,  there  is  a  definite  place  for  them  on  the  screen.   Johnny  Weissmuller  has  played  safe  so  far;  that  is,  concerning  his  career.  He  has  declared  that  he  is  not  now  and  never  will  be  an  actor.   Well,  that's  making  sense.  If  he  maintains  that  spirit  of  humility,  is  willing  to  take  direc-  tion and  has  native  intelligence,  (I  never  met  the  young  man,  so  I  do  not  know)  he  ought  to  make  the  grade.

What  must  she  do  in  person?  Ask  almost  any  one  of  her  leading  men  and  watch  their  eyes  as  their  lips  frame  some  quick  but  unconvincing  answer  to  you !   We  all  knew,  in  Hollywood,  that  the  home  of  Ruth  Chatterton  and  Ralph  Forbes  was  not  quite  the  love-nest  that  young  couples  dream  of.   A  ND  then  George  Brent  was  cast  as  Ruth's  -*Meading  man.  Have  you  ever  seen  George  Brent  in  person?  I  don't  blame  Ruth.  He  radiates,  as  a  man,  what  Garbo  does  as  a  woman.   I  remember  I  had  luncheon  with  George  soon  after  he  commenced  that  picture.  He  had  been  through  one  matrimonial  experience  and  was  afraid  of  marriage.  "The  next  woman  must  be  intelligent.  She  must  have  lived  enough  to  have  wisdom;  be  kind;  under-  stand—"   When  he  had  finished  a  lengthy  description,  I  said,  "Look  out,  George.  You  are  describing  Ruth  Chatterton."   He  looked  startled.  I  do  not  believe  he  had  realized  of  whom  he  was  talking  until  I  jolted  him  into  realization.  But  he  had  been  making  love  to  Ruth  Chatterton  on  the  screen  and  had  unconsciously  described  her  as  his  dream  woman.    Although  directors  are  not  so  closely  in  con-  tact with  the  women  they  direct,  even  they  have  been  known  to  fall  under  the  spell  of  some  highly  fascinating  star.   There's  a  star  in  Hollywood,  right  now,  who  is  recovering  from  the  effect  of  too  much  di-  rector-propinquity. The  director's  wife  hurried  him  to  Europe.  She's  a  wise  woman.  She  un-  derstood.   She  knew  she  could  not  change  the  natural  results  of  the  propinquity  but  she  could  remove  the  propinquity.   Jack  Gilbert  got  Greta  Garbo  as  far  as  the  Santa  Ana  courthouse.  They  were  in  the  midst  of  their  screen  love-making.  But  as  love-  inspiring  and  inspired  as  Garbo  can  become,  she  never  entirely  loses  the  natural  shrewdness  of  her  Nordic  nature.   She  had  sense  enough  to  know  that  marriage  or  love  could  not  change  that  nature  within  her  and  that  it  would  never  completely  melt  with  Jack's  volatile,  erratic  one.   The  man  who  paid  the  price  for  the  results  of  this  screen  romance  was,  I  believe,  Mauritz  Stiller.  It  may  have  helped  to  break  his  heart.   But  could  Garbo  and  Gilbert  help  it  because  they  found  their  hearts  attuned  in  their  necessary  screen  love-making?   T^NO  you  remember  the  days  when  Beverly  -*-^Bayne  and  Francis  X.  Bushman  startled  the  then  more  prudish  world  by  their  marriage?  Beverly  and  Francis  were  doing  screen  love-  making.  They  liked  it.  They  made  the  mis-  take of  trying  to  perpetrate  what  could  not  be  perpetrated.    How  well  I  remember  the  night  Lupe  Velez  heard  a  rumor  that  Gary  Cooper  and  his  lead-  ing lady  were  interested  in  each  other.  Lupe  went  to  location.  And  Lupe  can  hold  her  man  against  any  competition  when  she  is  among  those    present.   Gary  didn't  have  another  chance  to  remember  whether  the  lips  he  was  kissing  for  the  screen  were  those  of  a  live  girl  or  a  mummy.   He  was  thinking  of  Lupe.   "DUT  how  few  wives  can  go  on  the  set  with  -'-'their  husbands?  Lupe  wasn't  a  wife.  If  she  had  been,  well —  "Afraid  to  trust  her  husband,  eh?  Follows  him  everywhere  like  a  pet  poodle."   How  many  times  I  have  heard  remarks  like  that  made  of  a  woman  who  drops  in  only  casually  to  see  her  actor  husband.   There  were  rumors  that  some  one  was  "in-  terested" in  Clark  Gable.  Mrs.  Gable  proved  what  a  wise  little  woman  she  is.  She  went  to  New  York  and  remained  until  those  rumors  had  subsided.  Perhaps  they  had  no  basis  in  fact,  but  she  was  not  taking  any  chances.  And  these  rumors  were  all  started  because  of  screen  love-making.   The  price  is  high.  No  husband  or  wife  of  an  actress  or  actor  can  rest  assured  of  a  mate's  continued  loyalty.   Being  a  Hollywood  mate  requires  infinite  patience  and  almost  super-human  under-  standing.   Which  explains  why  there  are  so  many  Hollywood  divorces.  Just  old-fashioned  hu-  man nature,  the  kind  which  cannot  be  written  in  or  out  of  a  script.    The  Boy  Who  Won't  Act    continued  from  page  40    his  uncle's  restaurant  on  56th  Street  in  New-  York.  He  was  the  dishwasher.  No,  not  play  dishwasher — the  absolutely  real  thing!   They  stood  him  on  a  stool — he  was  far  too  short  to  reach  the  sink — and  tied  a  huge  apron  about  his  neck.  And  he  washed!  Hour  after  hour!    Hour  after  hour!   He  remembers  that,  by  standing  on  tip-toe  and  wiping  the  steam  from  the  little  kitchen  window,  he  could  see  the  boys  at  play  in  the  next  alley.   And  many  a  time  he  felt  the  sting  of  a  switch  across  his  little  legs  from  too  much  alley-gazing.   But  Saturday  night  was  a  festive  occasion.  After  the  restaurant  closed,  his  uncle  gathered  up  all  the  pastries  that  were  left,  packed  them  in  a  pasteboard  box  and  gave  them  to  Eric.  Dear  me!  was  there  excitement  in  the  little  attic  rooms  of  the  Lindens  when  Eric  arrived  bearing  glad  tidings  in  the  shape  of  left-over  pastries.   •""THE  mother  was  companion  to  an  old  lady.  ■*■  She  had  to  wait  until  the  grande  dame  was  tucked  in  bed  for  the  night,  all  her  needs  attended  to,  before  she  could  hurry  home  to  the  little  flock  awaiting  her.  Often  the  gas  would  run  out  while  they  waited  for  their  mother  and  there  was  no  quarter  to  drop  into  the  meter.  And  there  they  would  sit,  huddled  together  in  the  cold  and  dark,  little  hand  touching  hand,  terror  growing  upon  them,  stronger  every  minute.  The  ghastly,  sicken-  ing fear  of  childhood!  The  eldest  boy,  as  the  protector  of  the  brood,  sat  clutching  a  bread  knife  to  combat  the  ogre  that  might    It  must  be  a  dreamy  waltz  Dolores  Del  Rio  is  dancing  with  Charlie  Far-  rell.  Or  maybe  they  just  slowed  up  to  help  our  photographer  get  a  good  shot.  That's  Johnny  Weissmuller  in  the  background.  Wonder  if  his  partner  deliberately  ducked  her  head  behind  their  clasped  hands!  Heigho!    spring  out  of  the  darkness.  Waiting — listen-  ing— how  the  seconds  dragged!  Never  was  a  mother   so   welcome !   THE  wee  lad  went  from  job  to  job.  He  swept  out  a  millinery  shop  and  delivered  ladies'  hats,  after  school.  On  and  off  busses,  subways,  "L's"  and  street  cars,  with  a  hat  box  in  each  hand.  Then  he  became  a  tele-  graph messenger.   When  he  was  about  ten,  he  was  an  actor  in  a  real  tragedy  that  made  a  terrible  impression  on  the  lad.  And  it  undoubtedly  helped  im-  measurably in  making  Eric  Linden  the  actor  he  is.   He  and  his  younger  brother  were  playing  in  the  street  in  front  of  the  house.  Suddenly  little  brother  laughed,  tagged  Eric  and  ran  into  the  street  right  in  front  of  a  truck.  There  was  just  one  scream!   And  there  little  brother  lay!  Dead  before  Eric's  eyes!   He  stood  there  and  thought,  "I've  got  to  tell  Mom.  There's  no  one  to  tell  her  but  me.  I've  got  to  tell  her. "   He  remembers  climbing  the  stairs  and  open-  ing the  door.  His  mother  was  sewing  by  the  window,  and  he  told  her.  He  experienced  the  strangest,  emptiest  feeling — as  if  all  the  things  he  had  ever  longed  for— that  ball,  glove,  game — were  pitifully  unimportant  now.  He  was  face  to  face  with  stark  reality  and  it  left  its  mark.   But  there  were  pleasant  times  to  remember,  too.  On  summer  Sundays  his  mother  would  pack  their  lunches  in  shoe  boxes  and  off  they'd  go,  all  of  them,  to  the  beach.    Eric  says  they    10 ',    Photoplay  Magazine  for  January,    1933    I05    m&i    Jay  Irving    "Not  the  Mrs.  Martin  Johnson?!!"    didn't  have  many  friends,  but  they  really  didn't  need  them  as  the  family  was  bound  so  closely  together  in  the  struggle  for  mere  existence.   It  is  easy  to  sense  from  Eric  Linden  that  the  family  had  gentleness,  fineness  and  sensitive-  ness. They  took  life  like  rare  good  sports,  but  the  wounds  left  their  mark.  Especially  on  the  sensitive  Eric.   A  NOTHER  lovely  memory  is  his  Sunday  ■*  \job.  He  loved  it  because  it  brought  him  the  only  real  beauty  he  had.  He  was  a  choir  boy,  and  the  soft  music,  the  spiritual  atmos-  phere, the  peace  were  the  kind  of  beauty  this  lad's  artistic  soul  yearned  for.   His  elder  brother  and  sister  were  working  their  way  through  Columbia,  so  Eric  got  him-  self a  job  at  the  university  filing  intelligence  tests.  He  was  in  high  school  then.  As  the  work  paid  by  the  hour,  he  often  filed  away  until  midnight.  Then,  after  several  more  drab  and  colorless  jobs,  he  decided  to  be  an  usher — at  the  Roxy.  Here  now  was  the  job  that  filled  all  his  boyish  craving  for  life  and  glamour  and  color.  He  felt  grand  in  his  gorgeously  gay  uniform,  standing  under  a  blazing  spotlight.     Was  he  something!   Alas!  One  night  his  English  teacher  spied  him!  Good-bye,  resplendent  uniform,  gay  trapping,  colorful  job!  The  idea  of  an  honor  pupil  in  English  a  mere  usher!  So  Eric  parted  with  his  uniform  and  went  on  to  the  less  spectacular  job  of  runner  for  a  Wall  Street  bond  house.   But  he  did  not  aspire  to  be  a  "captain  of  finance."  The  stage  soon  claimed  him.  Life  was  beginning  to  treat  him  more  kindly.  He  was  in  the  company  playing  "The  Road  to  Rome"  and  the  engagement  took  him  to  England.   The  scene  in  "Life  Begins,"  where  he  gets  the    tragic   news  about   his   wife's   death   in    childbirth,  had  its  counterpart  in  his  life.  Eric's  elder  brother  and  his  wife  lived  with  the  Lindens  and  the  young  bride  was  expecting  her  first  baby.  Eric  was  about  fifteen  then  and  he  remembers  sitting  by  his  brother's  side.  Hour  after  hour,  hour  after  hour!  Some  unknown  fear  seemed  to  grow  with  every  tick  of  the  clock.  There  were  no  pacing,  no  hand  wringing,  no  hysterics!  Just  a  quiet,  tense  waiting!   To  the  boy  of  fifteen  it  seemed  the  end  and  the  beginning  of  everything  horrible.  So,  when  it  came  time  for  Eric  to  play  such  a  scene,  there  it  was — alive  in  his  memory —  waiting  to  be  plucked  out  again.   During  the  production  of  "Life  Begins"  he  kept  to  himself.  He  wanted  solitude  to  re-  gain and  re-live  those  poignant  moments  so  he  could  transfer  them  truly  to  the  screen.   Eric  lives  with  his  mother  in  a  modest,  hill-  side home.  He  has  a  garden,  the  realization  of  a  youthful  longing.  Once,  when  his  mother  was  a  parish  housekeeper,  he  tried  to  do  some-  thing about  the  dark  little  patch  of  garden  behind  the  parish  house,  but  it  was  hopeless.  Now  that  he  has  a  real  garden  he  indulges  himself  in  his  hobby  to  the  full.   "LJTE  seldom  mingles  with  people.

Tom  would  tell  me  very  quietly  just  what  I  was  to  do,  and  somehow — don't  ask  me  how — I  knew  exactly  what  he  meant  and  why.  We  were  doing  those  things  so  that  the  little  box  on  legs  could  make  a  picture  of  us.  I  was  an  actor!   TN  the  evenings  we  went  back  to  our  little  ■^-place  in  Newhall.  Tom  had  built  a  little  one-  room  shack  with  a  lean-to  for  me.  Sometimes  there  would  be  nothing  to  eat  when  we  got  home.  "Tony,"  Tom  would  say,  " I  know  you  are  tired  and  hungry,  but  you  just  rest  here  a  minute,  old  fellow,  and  I'll  be  back  with  some-  thing." And  when  he  came  back,  maybe  hours  later,  so  tired  he  could  hardly  drag  his  feet,  his  watch  would  be  gone  but  he  had  oats  and  hay  for  me.  And  I've  seen  him,  many  a  time,  pull  in  his  belt  and  grin — and  I  knew  he  had  gone  to  bed  hungry.   Then  we  would  sell  the  picture  we'd  been  working  on  (two-reel  Westerns,  they  called  them),  and  then  we'd  have  a  few  dollars  to  snare.  But  most  of  the  money  would  go  right  back  into  another  picture.   And  then  Tom  fell  in  love.  Every  Sunday  he'd  ride  me  down  to  her  home.  Her  name  was  Victoria  Forde  and  her  mother  kept  the  board-  ing house  where  Tom  had  once  lived.   Tom  had  been  saving  and  scrimping  to  buy  Victoria  a  Christmas  present.  At  last  he  had  saved  enough  money,  so  he  rode  me  down  to  the  city.  Tom  showed  me  the  present  when  he  came  out  of  the  store,  and  I've  never  seen  any-  thing like  it  before  or  since.  It  was  a  bright  pink  celluloid  comb  and  brush,  in  the  brightest  red  plush  box  I  have  ever  seen.  It  was  really  the  box  that  took  our  eye.  Tom  had  it  all  wrapped  up  fancy  and  early  Christmas  morn-  ing we  set  out  for  her  house.   She  liked  the  present,  especially  the  box.  It  wasn't  long  until  we  all  went  down  into  Mexico  and  were  married.  Tom  brought  her  out  to  live  with  us  in  our  little  one-room  shack,  and  we  were  very  happy.  Hungry  at  times,  maybe,  but  happy.  I  didn't  know  it  then,  but  now  that  I  look  back  over  so  much  I  realize  how  haooy  we  were.   Times  got  better,  too.  Tom  bought  twelve  acres  of  land  out  in  Edendale  for  a  ranch,  and  he  and  Mrs.  Tom  moved  into  Hollywood.   Everyone  was  anxious  to  see  Tom  Mix  and  Tony  on  the  screen  now  and  times  got  better  and  better.   T  GOT  to  be  a  better  actor,  too,  never  hesitat-  -*•  ing  to  do  anything  Tom  asked  me.  "Walk  down  to  that  tree,  Tony,  then  stop  and  look  back,"  he'd  say,  showing  me  just  how  he  wanted  it  done.  And  I'd  do  it.  Why,  we  thought  nothing  of  leaping  into  burning  build-  ings, down  dangerous  chasms  or  jumping  off  the  pier  into  the  ocean.   Once  they  timed  an  explosion  in  the  road  so  that  it  would  blow  up  just  after  Tom  and  I  passed  over  it.  But  something  went  wrong  and  just  as  Tom  and  I  reached  the  spot,  the  ex-  plosion occurred,  knocking  us  both  far  into  the  air.   I  came  to,  first,  and  got  to  my  feet.  I  saw  Tom  lying  very  still  on  his  face  and  I  was  frightened.  I  went  to  him  and  rolled  him  over  with  my  nose.  He  opened  his  eyes  slowly  and  smiled  at  me.  He  was  hurt,  I  knew,  and  my  whole  side  was  torn  and  bleeding.  They  picked  pebbles  out  of  both  of  us  for  a  week  but,  shucks,  that  was  nothing  to  what  we  have  since  come  through  together.   They  never  tried  to  force  me  when  I  refused  to  take  a  leap  or  jump.  They'd  hunt  around  until  they  discovered  the  loosened  boulder  or  cracked  earth  that  would  have  meant  our  death  had  we  gone  on.     How  I  knew  these   106    things  before  they  did  is  something  I've  often  wondered  about  but  could  never  reason  out.   I  learned  how  to  look  my  best  before  a  camera  and  when  to  stop  acting.  "Will  you  look  at  that  horse?  "  a  visitor  on  location  once  remarked  in  my  hearing,  "how  he  struts  and  acts  before  the  camera,  and  the  minute  he's  out  of  camera  range  he's  right  back  to  eating  grass  as  nonchalantly  as  you  please."   Huh,  I  thought  to  myself,  why  not?  I'm  not  one  of  those  actors  that  can't  stop  acting,  even  when  there's  no  camera  around!   But  as  soon  as  the  sun  reached  a  certain  spot  in  the  sky,  I  knew  enough  work  had  been  done  that  day  even  if  the  men  didn't.  Just  plain  horse  sense,  I  guess.   Anyway,  at  five  I  quit.  And  they  knew  it  was  no  use  to  argue  with  me.   So  they  would  load  me  into  my  truck  and  take  me  back  to  my  stable.  How  I  loved  to  go  fast  in  my  truck.  I'd  paw  loudly  with  my  foot  to  go  faster  and  often  my  driver  would    Irving  Lippman    A  forward  looking  girl  is  Eleanor  Holm.  She's  taking  no  chance  of  being  stranded  after  a  tiff  with  the  boy  friend.  The  shirred  satin  lining  in  her  slipper  is  really  a  pocket  in  which  she  can  keep  her  "mad"  money.  But  an  Olympic  champion  winner  like  Eleanor  could  easily  swim  home    yell  back  at  me,  "For  heavens  sake,  Tony,  I  can't  go  any  faster  here  or  the  cops  will  get  us."  I  had  a  weakness  for  fancy  saddles  and  bright  plaid  blankets,  and  Tom  knew  it  and  under-  stood. He  liked  bright,  gay  things  himself.  So  once,  when  a  strange  groom  placed  a  drab  old  blanket  on  my  back,  I  was  hopping  mad.  Do  you  think  I'd  budge?  No  sir.  The  groom  couldn't  understand  it  until  finally  someone  who  knew  me  spotted  that  blanket  and  re-  placed it  with  a  nice  plaid  one,  and  then  I  went.   HpOM  decided  to  go  to  Europe.  They  slung  ■*■  me  up  in  a  hoist  onto  the  ship  and  it  was  work,  as  I  weighed  ten  hundred  and  fifty  pounds  and  stood  fourteen  hands  high.  I  was  exercised  around  the  deck  of  the  ship  every  morning  and  really  enjoyed  it.   In  England  I  was  at  a  very  fashionable  stable,  and  never  shall  I  forget  the  horse  in  the  stall  next  to  me.  He  was  English,  of  course,  and  if  ever  I  saw  style  and  class  he  had  it.  And  was  he  snooty?  He  looked  me  up  and  down  several  times  and  gave  one  big  sniff.  But  when  he  saw  me  making  my  own  bed  that  night — I  always  arranged  the  hay  with  my  foot  to  suit  myself — I  thought  he  would  break  out  in  spavins.  But  I  didn't  care.  Tom  was  probably  dunking  his  cake  in  his  coffee  at  one  of  those  big  mansions  I'd  seen  and  not  giving  a  picayune.   The  next  morning  a  young  fellow  was  ushered  into  my  stall.  He  reached  out  a  hand  to  pat  me  and,  suddenly,  withdrew  it.  He  sensed  I  wouldn't  like  it  and  that  made  a  big  hit  with  me.  Here  was  a  man  who  understood  horses.  When  he  left  he  placed  his  hand  very  gently  on  my  head  as  if  he  were  just  shaking  hands.   "Who  was  that?"  I  asked  Mr.  Highhat  in  the  next  stall.   "That,"  he  answered,  and  I  noticed  a  new  note  of  respect  in  his  voice,  "is  His  Royal  High-  ness, the  Prince  of  Wales."   We  traveled  all  over  Europe  with  lords  and  dukes  and  ladies  all  eager  to  greet  us.  Just  plain  Tom  Mix  and  me.    It  seemed  strange.   Home  again,  we  made  personal  appearances  in  twenty-five  big  cities.  Children  were  some-  times disappointed  when  they  saw  me,  for  on  the  screen  they  imagined  me  black  instead  of  sorrel.  But  they'd  soon  recognize  me  by  my  white  feet  and  white  face.   By  the  time  we  got  back  to  Hollywood,  Tom  was  a  very  rich  man.  He  began  building  his  big  new  mansion  in  a  place  called  Beverly  Hills.  I  was  happy  about  the  place,  but  inside  me  was  a  dreadful  fear.  Tom  might  not  need  me  or  want  me  any  more  with  a  grand  new  house  and  new  friends.  But  I  never  let  on.  One  day  he  came  out  to  the  ranch  and  said,  "Hi,  Tony,  how's  the  boy?"  I  nodded.  "Come  on,  I  want  to  show  you  something,"  he  said.   COON  we  were  passing  beautiful  homes  on  ^lovely,  quiet  streets  and  I  knew  we  were  in  Beverly  Hills.  Suddenly,  there  it  was — his  grand  new  house.  I  knew  it  by  the  initials,  T.  M.,  on  the  gate.  Tom  was  always  one  for  putting  initials  on  everything.  I  glimpsed  a  swimming  pool  and  a  tennis  court.  "Know  what  this  is,  Tony?"  Tom  asked.  "Step  up  here  and  give  a  look."  It  was  a  beautiful  building  right  near  the  gate  and  was  as  grand,  almost,  as  the  house.  I  looked  in.  "You're  home,  old  boy,"  Tom  said.   It's  strange  the  way  things  go  in  life.  People  can  be  so  happy  with  nothing  and  so  unhappy  with  everything.  And  I  could  see  with  one  eye  how  things  were  with  Tom  and  Mrs.  Tom.   They  soon  parted,  she  taking  little  Thomasina.  Tom  and  I  went  on  to  the  circus  and  you  should  have  seen  me  in  that  parade.  Did  I  show  them  something?  "Well,"  one  of  those  fancy  riding  horses  once  sneered,  "you'd    Photoplay  Magazine  for  January,  1933    think  he  were  a  trained  horse  or  something  the  way  he  struts."  And  did  I  put  that  madam  in  her  place.  I  told  her  about  the  blazing  build-  ings, the  yawning  chasms,  the  daily  chances  with  death  that  Tom  and  I  took  together.  Trained  horse,  indeed.   '"Besides,"  I  said,  "I  want  you  to  know  I'm  a  movie  star,  known  by  thousands.  And  who  are  you?  "   And  that  knocked  the  pink  ribbon  off  her  tail.   And  then  we  came  back  to  movie  acting.  Tom  married  another  girl.  This  one  was  from  the  circus  and  performed  high  up  in  the  air.  I  liked  her  very  much.   We've  made  our  best  pictures,  I  believe,    since  our  return  from  the  circus.  Tom  was  sick  and  nearly  died,  but  outside  of  that  we've  been  happier  than  we've  been  for  a  long  time.  Until  my  accident.  And  the  realization  that  I  couldn't  go  on  much  longer.   And  now  it's  over,  Tom  tells  me.  For  me,  at  least.  All  the  thrills,  the  travel  and  excite-  ment are  done.  No  more  crowds.  No  more  movies.   Somehow,  I  can't  be  sorry.  I  guess  I'm  tired.  I've  reached  the  ripe  old  age  of  twenty-  three  years,  twenty-one  of  them  spent  with  Tom.  We've  seen  more  and  been  more  places  than  most  people.   I  am  alone  again — but  happy — in  green  pastures.    Twas  a  Great  Year  for  Divorces   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  75  ]    his  clipped,  precise  speech  the  news  that  he  and  Miss  Chatterton  shortly  would  be  man  md  wife.   After  that  things  happened  in  a  rush.  Ruth  jo  sooner  docked  in  New  York  than  she  put  in  a  telephone  call  to  California  for  "Rafe."   "Hello,  darling.  Everything  is  topping,"  he  assured  her.  "It's  all  right  for  you  to  go  ahead  and  marry  George. "  And  that's  all  there  was  to  that.  Unless  you  count  the  kiss  with  which  she  and  Brent  startled  the  justice  of  the  peace  in  Westchester  County  when  he  declared  them  one.  He  said  he'd  never  seen  anything  like  it  off  the  screen.  Now  that  they're  back  in  Hollywood  they  have  dinner  with  Ralph  once  a  week,  and  for  his  birthday  they  gave  him  a  super,  super  sort  of  radio.   ANN  HARDING'S  parting  from  Harry  -**-Bannister  was  almost  amicable.  They  didn't  want  to  wait  until  they  reached  the  point  where  they  began  to  bicker.  So,  to  save  the  fragments  of  their  love,  they  let  the  judge  undo  the  knot  the  minister  had  so  carefully  tied.   It  was  a  painless,  almost  pleasant  operation  the  way  they  did  it.  Amid  fond  kisses  and  best  wishes  they  said  good-bye.   The  Lowell  Sherman-Helene  Costello  di-  vorce offers  emphasis  by  contrast  to  these  con-  genial dissolutions.  Lowell  for  once  lost  his  urbanity.  Oh,  my  yes!  He  and  Helene  had  verbal  skirmishes  in  the  courtroom  and  he  accused  her  of  reading  such  naughty  books.  All  very  turbulent  and  noisy.  Hardly  in  the  1932  manner!   Winnie  Lightner  and  George  Holtrey  were  another  couple  who  refused  to  say  it  with  flow-  ers.   There  was  hurt  there  and  heartache  when  they  told  it  to  His  Honor.   It  was  really  ZaSu  Pitts  who  started  the  split-ups  of  the  year  when  she  filed  suit  against  Tom  Gallery  last  January.  Up  to  that  time  they  had  been  looked  upon  as  a  most  loving  couple.   They  had  the  two  children — one  of  them  was  Barbara  LaMarr's  son  whom  they  adopted.   But  even  ZaSu's  delightful  sense  of  humor  couldn't  scare  away  the  divorce  specter.   You  remember  Dorothy  Lee,  of  course —  that  dashing  half-pint  who  capered  on  the  screen  with  Wheeler  and  Woolsey.  I  have  a  vivid  recollection  of  her  coming  into  my  office,  ■oerching  on  the  edge  of  my  desk,  and  inquir-  ing— "  Do  you  know  a  Jimmy  Fidler?  He  saw  me  at  the  Brown  Derby  yesterday  at  luncheon  and  wrote  me  a  note.  This  morning  a  wire  came  from  him  asking  me  to  dine  with  him —  he  gave  you  as  a  reference. "   Well,  that  was  the  beginning.  Within  six  months  they  were  married — and  in  a  year  di-  vorced. Dorothy  smiled  sweetly  at  the  judge,  pouted  prettily  at  Jimmy  and  that  was  all  there  was  to  it.  Now  they're  holding  hands  again  and  some  say  if  the  young  man  had  his    way  she  would  be  Mrs.  Fidler  once  more.  Dorothy  hasn't  said  "yes"  and  she  hasn't  said  "no."  But  she  admits  it's  kind  of  nice  to  keep  Jimmy  around.   Bert  Wheeler,  her  former  partner,  followed  her  example  and  did  a  fancy  step  over  to  the  courtroom  where  his  life  contract  with  Bernice  Speer  was  duly  dissolved.  Nothing  distressing  about  it.   "We  simply  have  outgrown  each  other,"  Bernice  explained,  and  pinned  a  gardenia  on  Bert's  lapel.   There's  a  great  deal  of  guessing  going  on  as  to  the  cause  of  Vivian  Duncan's  separation  from  Nils  Asther.  Their  romance  was  dis-  tinctly of  the  whirlwind  variety.  It  would  sub-  side for  a  time,  then  they'd  meet  at  a  party  and  it  would  flame  up  again.  Finally  they  decided  to  strike  a  more  even  tempo  by  marrying.   Came  a  small  daughter — born  in  Berlin —  and  Poppa  Nils  made  a  grand  fuss  when  she  and  Mamma  Vivian  returned.  He  had  been  detained  by  picture  work  so  that  he  couldn't  accompany  his  wife  abroad.  But,  as  the  months  rolled  by,  it  became  evident  that  bubbling  Little  Eva  was  unsuited  temperamentally  to  the  Nordic  Nils.  So  they  shook  hands,  said  it  had  been  wonderful  while  it  lasted.  The  final  decree  has  just  been  granted.   A  few  of  the  others  carrying  banners  in  the  Hollywood  divorce  parade  are  Edna  Murphy  and  Mervyn  LeRoy,  Lina  Basquette  and  Teddy  Hayes,  George  Jessel  and  Florence  Jessel.  All  very  friendly.  Although  little  Bobbe  Arnst  did  shed  a  few  tears  when  she  gave  up  Johnny  Weissmuller.  But  what's  a  poor  girl  to  do  when  her  hubby  prefers  to  "go  out  with  the  boys"  than  with  her?  And  so  they  parted.  But  that  didn't  prevent  Johnny  from  taking  Bobbe  along  when  he  made  tests  for  his  new  picture.   HPHE  easiest  kind  of  divorce  is  had  through  -*-  the  mails.  All  you  have  to  do  is  look  through  a  neat  little  catalogue,  choose  the  best  looking  Mexican  judge,  and  forthwith  apply  to  be  severed  from  your  spouse.  Miriam  Hopkins  indulged  in  this  kind  when  she  and  Austin  Parker  decided  they  were  not  pulling  so  well  together  in  double  harness.   It  was  a  matter  of  just  a  few  days — and  all  was  over.  They  were  free  to  continue  their  pleasant  camaraderie  without  having  to  face  each  other  across  the  breakfast  table  every  morning.   And  the  plans  they're  making  for  the  baby's  Christmas!  Miriam's  son,  you  know.  Austin  has  gone  paternal  in  a  big  way,  although  just  what  relation  an  ex-husband  bears  to  one's  adopted  boy  is  a  bit  vague.   Hollywood's  divorce  cavalcade  has  passed  steadily  through  the  courts  in  1932,  with  scarcely  a  pause  between  partings.  When  love  has  flown — or  is  about  to  fly — the  stars  have  learned  to  give  it  the  most  civilized  of  leave-  takings.

[  CONTINUED  FROAI  PAGE  46]    younger  generation  of  the  metropolis.  The  youngsters  of  that  day  did  not  learn  about  Life  and  Life's  Problems  from  the  birds  and  the  flowers,  but  from  the  pen  of  our  heroine.   UNFORTUNATELY,  the  hounds  of  purity  were  on  the  trail.  One  dour  day  the  police  descended  upon  "Sex"  and  the  paddy-wagon  backed  up  to  the  stage  door.  In  due  time,  Mae  faced  Justice  (?)  on  the  Bench,  and  thereafter  served  ten  days  in  the  hoosegow  in  New  York  in  the  name  of  theatrical  freedom.  (Pictures  of  Mae  with  a  broom  and  a  dustpan  were  amusing  publicity  of  the  hour.)   Nothing  daunted,  Mae  launched  a  couple  of  other  high-geared  entertainments  from  her  pen.  One  didn't  approach  Broadway — the  other  received  instant  attention  from  the  gendarmes,  and  was  closed.   But  Mae  and  her  play,  "Diamond  Lil,"  did  the  trick — made  her  the  darling  of  the  town.   It  was  a  jolly,  whole-souled  story  of  gay  times  on  the  old  Bowery,  with  Mae  playing  one  of  her  big-hearted  naughty  ladies  who  gave  all  for  an  honest,  beautiful  love — the  party  of  the  second  part  being  a  seven-foot  officer  of  the  Salvation  Army.  New  York  loved  its  second  act,  set  in  an  old  time  Bowery  pot-house,  with  waiters  singing  heart  ballads,  drunks  and  snow-  birds battling  happily,  and  top-hatted  slum-  mers  from  uptown  sniffing  and  shrieking  at  the  scene.   The  show  ran  out  the  season,  and  established    our  Mae  as  a  Broadway  institution.  From  that  day  to  this  she's  been  our  bouncing  baby-  doll,  our  "Diamond  Lil"!   And  off-stage?   What  a  woman!   In  spite  of  the  fact  that  she's  a  footlight  veteran,  Mae  is  young.  It  wasn't  long  ago  that  she  turned  thirty  like  a  handspring.  Moreover,  she's  practically  beautiful,  in  her  opulent  way.  Luscious  complexion,  fine  head  of  hair,  and  eyes  that  fairly  knock  your  hat  off.  Though  generously  built,  she  jiggles  the  beam  at  under  a  hundred  and  twenty.  Believe  me,  you  look  three  times  as  Mae  West  passes  by!  She's  spectacular  on  and  off.   Girls  always  bombard  and  besiege  her  at  the  stage  door.  I  used  to  have  to  fight  my  way  through  a  mass  of  admirers  when  I  went  back  to  say  howdy.  She  has  the  glitter  that  is  more  precious  than  rubies.   T  IKE  most  ladies  who  play  glamorous  bad  -^girls,  Mae  is  almost  oppressively  good.  True,  she  has  a  taste  for  the  rococo  in  furnishings,  being  especially  fond  of  splendurgeous  four-  poster  golden  beds  that  rest  on  platforms  and  are  covered  with  a  canopy.  But  that,  as  Dickens  said,  is  an  amiable  weakness.   And  while  snooty  and  sniffish  ladies  of  the  stage  have  been  caught  red-handed  in  all  sorts  of  peccadilloes,  not  the  faintest  breath  of  scandal  has  ever  brushed  the  damask  cheek  of  Mae.    All  her  whoop-di-doo  is  right  out  in  public  on  the  stage  and  screen — to  amuse  and  divert  the  folks  who  pay  to  see  her!   Mae  doesn't  write  her  stuff — she  builds  it.  Seized  with  a  central  character,  bit  by  bit  she  erects  around  it  a  good  loud  show.  She  keeps  a  dictaphone  handy  at  all  times.  Her  knowledge  of  the  theater  is  profound.   \A  ORE,  what  is  little  realized,  in  the  face  of  ■*■  * -"-Mae's  spectacular  qualities,  is  the  fact  that  she  is  a  brilliant  actress.  She  has  one  of  the  finest  senses  of  timing  I  have  ever  seen,  and  no-  body in  the  world  can  milk  the  last  ounce  of  value  from  a  line  like  wild  and  wilful  Mae.   And  there's  a  rapid  pen  sketch  of  Mae  West !  You're  going  to  see  a  lot  more  of  this  giddy  girl,  and  you're  going  to  love  it.  She'll  bring  count-  less howls  into  movie  evenings  that  were  grow-  ing too  doggone  decorous  and  restrained!   Here's  a  hot  tip,  gleaned  from  "Night  After  Night."  What  a  team  Skipworth  and  West  will  make  for  a  few  sizzling  pictures.  The  di-  sheveled refinement  of  Skippy  and  the  dazzling  loudness  of  Mae — hot  dog,  what  a  brilliant  chance  for  good,  loud  fun!  Get  busy,  you  script- makers!   No  more  welcome  or  amusing  recruit  has  ever  hit  the  screen  than  slithering,  slinking  "  Diamond  Lil"!   Hi,  Mae,  way  out  thar  in  Hollywood!  Regards  from  your  old  admirer!  "Hello,  honey — whatta  yuh  doin'  tonight?  "    Her  Tongue  in  Her  Cheek    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  69    money  for  anyone.  I  understood  that.  But  I  believe  that  a  person  must  either  push  forward  or  go  backwards.  The  movement  may  be  im-  perceptible, but  it  is  there.  You  can  never  stand  still.   "T  HAD  worked  hard.  I  had  been  given  fine  -*-  opportunities.  When  the  studio  didn't  want  to  give  me  my  raise,  I  felt  as  though  I  had  come  to  that  point  where  I  would  either  slip  back  or  step  forward.  I  had  only  intended  to  make  one  picture  in  Hollywood.  The  stage  was  my  love.  I  thought  that  to  go  back,  to  do  something  good  on  Broadway  would  mean  progress.  Change  so  often  does.  I  wouldn't  get  as  much  money  there,  you  know — so  it  wasn't  really  money."   With  the  trunks  packed  and  her  ambitious  eyes  already  on  her  next  step  forward,  she  an-  swered a  telephone  call  from  Joseph  Schenck.  She  had  no  agent  for  pictures — only  one  for  the  stage.  Producer  Schenck  wanted  to  talk  business.  She  represented  herself  at  the  con-  ference. And  when  she  left,  she  had  a  contract  in  her  pocket  to  play  the  lead  with  Al  Jolson  in  "Hallelujah, I'm  a  Bum.  "  A  six  weeks'guar-  antee  at  twelve  hundred  dollars  a  week.  The  picture  to  start  June  first.     It  was  now  May.   Madge  collected  eight  weeks'  pay  before  that  production  even  started.  Eight  times  twelve  hundred  is  ninety-six  hundred  dollars.  And  all  that  time,  Hollywood  was  shaking  its  head  and  saying,  "  Poor  Madge  Evans.  She  wanted  to  free-lance  and  look  what  happened  to  her.  She  can't  even  get  a  job. "   Madge  never  felt  so  far  from  poor  in  her  life.   But  she  did  miss  the  magazine  stories,  and  the  daily  papers  never  mentioned  her  name  except  in  connection  with  her  boy-friend,  Tom  Gallery.  And  she  did  miss  that  hectic,  fan-  tastic but  encouraging  atmosphere  of  studio   108    fairyland.  She  missed  the  voices  which  had  said,  "You  were  grand  in  your  last  picture,  Madge.  You're  going  a  long  way  little  girl.  We're  going  to  do  big  things  for  you. "   I  doubt  if  Madge  realizes  this  yet.  When  an  ego  has  once  become  accustomed  to  Holly-  wood's encouragement — it  drops  from  the  heights  to  the  depths  without  it.  When  you  are  under  contract  and  being  "pushed"  by  a  big  studio,  head-waiter  Nick  even  gives  you  a  more  prominent  booth  at  the  Brown  Derby.  Hollywood  always  honors  those  whom  it  knows  are  up,  and  forgets  those  whom  it  thinks  are  down  or  on  the  way  down.   Even  when  Madge  began  work  on  the  Al  Jolson  picture,  she  felt  something  like  an  un-  wanted step-daughter.  Publicity  departments  push  their  own  players.  Madge  was  accus-  tomed to  spending  all  the  days  when  she  was  not  working,  for  example,  in  taking  fashion,  beauty  or  portrait  pictures  in  the  Metro  gal-  leries. But  United  Artists  didn't  waste  money  taking  beauty  and  fashion  and  portrait  pic-  tures of  a  girl  who  was  to  be  there  for  only  one  picture.  Not  one  writer  offered  to  interview  her.  And  Madge  had  formerly  had  luncheon  appointments  with  writers  almost  daily.   She  stuck  her  tongue  into  her  cheek,  tucked  the  twelve  hundred  a  week  into  her  pretty  silk  stocking  and  was  seen  more  and  more  often  in  public  with  Tom  Gallery.  Of  course,  there  was  not  even  an  agent's  commission  to  come  out  of  the  money.   Then  she  had  legal  trouble  with  the  Madge  Evans  Hat  Company.  They  stopped  making  hats.  Depression!  Metro  heard  about  the  lawyer  she  hired  for  this  and  telephoned  him.  Would  Madge  come  back?   To  go  home!  To  be  in  the  whirl  once  more.  To  make  pictures  which  would  build  her.  They  wanted  her  back.    That  meant  progress.    She    was  going  ahead.  She  signed  a  seven  year  contract.  Her  salary  began  at  eight  hundred  fifty  dollars.  Seven  years  from  now- — if  all  options  are  taken  up — she  will  be  drawing  around  two  thousand.   But  Madge  soon  learned  a  lesson  that  all  Hollywood  folk  must  learn  sooner  or  later.  It's  a  sad  little  lesson.  One  never  "comes  back  "  in  Hollywood  where  one  left  off.  Never.   SHE  might  have  been  a  stranger.  She  was  on  the  lot  two  months  before  they  cast  her  in  a  picture,  then  it  was  in  "Fast  Life,"  with  comedian  Bill  Haines.  A  simple  little  role  such  as  they  would  give  to  any  beginner.   And  on  the  day  she  was  being  fitted  for  clothes  for  the  part,  they  were  still  testing  other  girls  for  it.  Martha  Sleeper  was  being  considered  to  replace  her — Madge  Evans.  Also,  Alice  White.   When  this  is  written,  she  has  not  been  in-  vited into  the  gallery  once.  She  has  not  been  invited  for  a  fashion  or  a  beauty  picture.  No  interviewers  have  been  rushed  to  talk  with  her.   And  people  in  speaking  to  her — they  all  speak  beautifully,  because  they  like  her  per-  sonally— forget  to  say,  "Your  last  picture  was  grand,  Madge.  You're  going  a  long  way,  dear.  We  are  going  to  do  big  things  for  you. "   She  has  a  hundred  dollars  more  a  week  than  they  offered  originally,  but  she's  lost  some-  thing for  which  she  has  to  fight  again  as  though  she  had  never  had  it.  And  she's  fighting.  She's  giving  the  best  that's  in  her.  She's  studying  and  practicing.  And — she  feels  she's  progressing.  There's  no  idea  of  going  back  now.

"   The  sweep  of  her  arm  included  the  entire  Paramount  studio.   "But  money  is  not  important.  To  be  happy  is  what  is  important."   Ah,  Europe,  could  you  but  teach  this  to  your  neighbor!   "T  DO  not  know  as  I  can  make  you  under-  ■*■  stand.  My  vocabulary  is  still  so  limited.  If  I  am  not  happy  when  I  work,  I  am  not  satis-  fied. I  am  happy  with  Mr.  Von  Sternberg  be-  cause I  trust  him.  How  do  I  know  what  another  director  could  do  with  me?   "I  was  not  the  big  sensation  in  Europe  that  publicity  stories  have  stated.  Europe  knows  that.  I  had  made  a  picture.  I  was  not  very  good  in  pictures.  When  I  met  him  in  Europe  and  he  asked  me  to  make,  'The  Blue  Angel,'  I  said,  'You  had  better  not  take  me,  I  am  terrible  in  pictures.    No!'   "The  studio  did  not  want  me,  too.  They  told  him  I  was  terrible.   "He  said,  T  will  have  to  take  a  test  to  show  you  that  you  are  not  terrible  and  to  show  UFA,  too.    You  are  all  stupid.'   "And  I  was  not  a  great  actress  on  the  stage,  either.  Not  a  star,  as  has  been  said.  In  Europe  no  young  girl  is  a  star.  I  had  played  leads,  but  that  is  far  from  being  a  star.  It  is  impossible  for  a  young  woman  to  be  a  star  in  Europe.  It  takes  a  very  long  time  before  Europe  makes  one  a  star.   "He  took  a  test.  He  made  'The  Blue  Angel'  with  me."   She  did  not  need  to  tell  that  "The  Blue  Angel"  was  the  sensation  of  Europe  and  that    she  became  a  sensation  with  it.  She  did  not  need  to  paint  the  picture  of  how  she  proved  the  exception  to  that  rule  that  no  young  woman  can  become  a  star  on  the  Continent.  She  was  one  by  popular  acclamation.   And  she  did  not  need  to  tell  me — although  she  did — that  Josef  Von  Sternberg,  through  his  direction,  had  done  it.  What  no  other  director  has  been  able  to  accomplish,  he  had  done.  He  had  transmitted  her  natural  beauty  and  ability  across  the  film  chasm.   And  now  that  she  was  a  sensation  in  her  own  land  where  she  had  formally  been  only  a  modest  beseecher,  they  wanted  her  to  go  to  America.  She  said,  "No."  Why  should  she  desert  glory  and  success  in  the  hand  for  possibilities  in  the  bush?  No  one  in  America  knew  her.  It  would  be  beginningalloveragain.  It  would  mean  a  new  language,  even.  Why  should  she  leave  her  family  for  something  un-  certain when  she  had  a  certain  Europe  at  her  feet?   "DUT  when  Von  Sternberg  asked  her  again  -•-'and  said,  "Come  over  and  make  pictures  for  me.     Not  for  Paramount,  but  with  me — "   There  was  no  uncertainty  there.  She  knew  what  he  could  do  with  her  and  for  her.  He  had  done  it  in  Europe.  He  could  do  it  in  America.  Whether  any  other  man  could  bridge  that  film  chasm  (no  other  had)  was  a  huge  question  mark.  He  was  the  bird  in  the  hand.  She  came  to  America  to  make  pictures  with  him.   She  is  leaving  America  because  she  will  make  pictures  with  no  one  except  him.  The  only  possible  chance  of  her  returning  is  for  the  same  reason  that  she  came  to  us  originally.    "Hollywood  gossip  overlooks  that  I  am  married  and  am  not  divorcing  my  husband,"  says  Marlene  Dietrich.  "He  is  coming  for  Christmas  and  then  we'll  be  happy."  This  picture  shows  the  way  Marlene  and  little  Maria  greeted  papa  Sieber  the  last  time  he  arrived  in  Hollywood  from  abroad   110    "This  is  not  because  of  any  Swngali  and  Trilby  influence,  but  because  he  is  the  best  friend  I  ever  had  in  the  world.  People  have  said  he  casts  a  spell  over  me.  That  is  ridiculous.  I  am  devoted,  but  I  made  the  devotion  my-  self because  my  brain  told  me  to.  It  is  only  common  sense  to  me.   "Can  you  think  of  any  one  casting  a  spell  over  me?  I  hate  any  one  wanting  to  clamp  a  hand  down  on  me.  I  would  never  make  a  con-  tract for  longer  than  six  months  because  I  hate  the  idea  of  being  nailed  down.  I  resent  it  terribly.   ''But  when  I  devote  myself  to  some  one,  no  one  can  undo  it.   "TDEOPLE  should  be  able  to  understand  that.  ■*-  If  you  meet  a  great  person,  you  become  devoted.  If  they  knew  him — he  has  no  way  of  talking  with  stupid  people.  He  has  no  patience  with  me  while  I  am  stupid.  Which  I  under-  stand.   Why  should  he  waste  his  time — "   But  to  change!  To  work  with  any  one  else!  It  is  actually  beyond  her  comprehension.  She  gave  an  example  which  she  is  afraid  our  people  will  not  understand.  I  am  going  to  risk  it.   "Before  I  had  my  child,  I  stopped  and  looked  at  every  child  in  the  street.  I  was  so  crazy  about  all  children.  But  now — when  I  have  my  own.  That  is  perfection.  Why  should  I  look  at  others?  I  have  the  best,  all  children  for  me — right  at  home.  I  feel  that  way  about  directors.  I  have  the  best.  Why  should  I  look  at  others?"   I  am  a  bit  afraid,  even  as  is  Marlene  her-  self, that  America  will  not  understand  her.  She  is  leaving  us  in  February,  for  always —  unless  Von  Sternberg,  who  is  definitely  "sick  and  tired  of  pictures"  (his  own  expression),  should  change  his  mind.  She  will  have  made  only  five  pictures  in  her  three  and  a  half  years  among  us,  but  with  those  five  she  has  chiselled  a  niche  on  the  portals  of  fame,  comparable  only  to  the  one  of  Garbo.   It  is  comprehensible  why  she  should  wish  to  be  understood  "just  once"  before  her  de-  parture.   Her  American  life  has  not  been  happy.  Her  first  year — Mrs.  Von  Sternberg's  suit  for  alienation  of  affections.  The  suit  was  under-  standable from  an  wholly  American  viewpoint.  — it  was  completely  a  puzzle  from  Marlene's  European  one.  She  had  a  husband.  He  under-  stood. Why  should  not  Mr.  Von  Sternberg's  wife  do  the  same?  she  reasoned.  Incidentally,  I  have  known  both  Marlene  and  Von  Stern-  berg since  she  first  came  and  I  have  always  said  both  in  print  and  in  person  that  Marlene's  devotion  has  always  been  as  she  now  explains  it.   A  mental  and,  to  her,  common  sense  one.   Then — the  fight  on  "Blonde  Venus."  Von  Sternberg  did  not  want  to  direct  it.  The  studio  wished  to  make  the  story  saccharine.  He  bolted.  Richard  Wallace  was  assigned  as  director.  She  bolted.  You  now  know  why.  Von  Sternberg  really  went  back  and  directed  that  picture  for  the  sake  of  Marlene.  He  hated  it  then — he  hates  it  now.  And  no  man  can  do  a  truly  great  picture  with  a  story  which  he  hates.   AND  then — the  kidnapping  threats  for  her  baby.  Any  description  of  her  suffering  would  sound  like  an  exaggeration.  That  Mar-  lene Dietrich  has  a  mother  complex,  no  Amer-  ican would  question.  To  her,  the  extent  of  her  love  is  only  as  natural  as  her  refusal  to  be  directed  by  any  man  other  than  the  one  who  bridged  the  screen  chasm  for  her.  The  letters  she  received  were  made  up  of  words  clipped  from  newspapers  to  avoid  trace  of  hand-  writing.    People  said  it  was  a  joke.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  January,  1933    I  I  I    They  continued  for  six  weeks.  Each  new  letter  showed  a  new  knowledge  of  her  move-  ments. Why  had  she  hired  detectives?  Why  had  she  taken  her  child  to  such  and  such  a  place  the  day  before?  Marlene  Dietrich  was  close  to  a  mad  woman.  Neither  she  nor  her  child  even  now  stir  in  the  open  today  without  armed  guards.   The  bars  on  the  windows  of  her  home  are  inches  thick.   During  the  thick  of  the  daily  threats,  she  received  word  from  the  department  of  im-  migration that  the  two  German  maids  should  return  home.  She  wrote  a  letter  that  she  was  employing  eleven  Americans— nine  of  whom  were  made  necessary  by  the  dangers  of  this  country.   Must  she  send  away  the  two  Germans,  the  only  ones  whom  she  could  truly  trust  with  her  child? — The  American  government  let  them  remain.   Then — the  Chevalier  gossip.  Marlene  and  Maurice  are  friends.  But— she  laughs.  "They  forget  I  am  married  and  I  am  not  divorcing  my  husband.  He  is  coming  for  Christmas  and  then  we  shall  be  really  happy  and  gay. "    Her  husband  has  had  many  clothes  made  for  Marlene  at  he*  tailors  in  Paris.  He  sent  these  clothes  back  to  Marlene  with  Maurice  Chevalier!  Again,  perhaps  only  Europeans  could  fully  understand  friendships  like  these.   I  do  not  believe  Marlene  will  cry  when  she  sails  to  sing  in  the  theaters  of  Paris  and  Berlin.   "My  child  will  be  safe  over  there — "  A  throb  in  her  voice  when  she  says  it.  "Not  no  more  troubles.  We  all  have  them.  But  less  troubles  and  not  so  much  silly  talk.   "But  I  am  happy  I  am  able  to  give  so  many  Americans  work  in  protecting  me  from  these  strange  customs.     Some  good  has  come — "   Her  eyes  twinkle.   I  think  they  will  twinkle  when  she  waves  goodbye  to  the  Statue  of  Liberty  which  has  not  meant  all  liberty  for  her.   Impossible,  perhaps,  for  an  American  to  vision  happiness  at  waving  goodbye  to  that  statue !   Impossible,  perhaps,  also,  for  a  European  like  Marlene,  to  vision  happiness  at  waving  it  a  second  welcome!    Cary  versus  Gary    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  33  ]    M-G-M  has  learned,  with  its  Shearer- Garbo-  Crawford  tangle!   What  on  earth  can  Paramount  do  with  Cary  and  Gary  under  the  roof  of  the  same  sound-  stages?  One  of  them  must  go!  One  must  be  eliminated.  Everybody  knows  that.  But  no-  body knows  how  the  elimination  is  to  be  done,  nor  who  of  the  two  will  be  eliminated.   "DUT  it  up  to  the  public?  The  studio,  delib-  ■*-  erately  opposing  the  two  men,  made  "Devil  and  the  Deep. "  That  was  putting  Cary  and  Gary  into  the  same  ring,  with  a  vengeance!  Gary  had  the  lead.  Cary  had  a  supporting  part.  Gary  was  good.  So  was  Cary.  Nothing  was  settled.  Nothing  happened  at  all,  indeed  — except  that  the  public  went  home  from  the  show  mumbling,  "  But  then  who  was  that  other  tall  fellow?  Was  that—?  No.  Which  was  which?"  The  only  result  was  an  increase  in  the  general  confusion,  a  heightening  of  the  realization  that  one  of  the  two,  Cary  or  Gary  must  go.  They  are  too  much  alike!  Round  four,  "Devil  and  the  Deep"  was  a  draw,  with  honors  even.   The  sad  part  of  it  is  that  both  Gary  and  Cary  know  what  is  happening.  They  know  that  they're  pitted  against  each  other,  and  that  when  the  final  gong  sounds,  one  of  them  will  be  on  the  floor.  It's  rather  a  shame.  Both  of  them  are  such  regular  guys!  They  admire,  like,  and  respect  each  other.  Neither  of  them  will  win  without  regrets  for  the  man  he  has  vanquished.  Life  should  be  softer,  gentler;  there  ought  to  be  a  way  in  which  both  men  could  win.  But  life  isn't  that  way.  For  every  winner  there  must  be  a  loser.   Round  five  is  going  on  right  now.  And  just  as  in  a  real  prize  ring,  the  glaring  lights  over-  head bring  the  straining  torsos  of  the  boxers  into  sharp  relief,  so  the  present  state  of  affairs  is  bringing  into  clear  sight  the  strong  points  and  the  weak  points  on  either  side.  What  we  are  really  watching  is  a  battle  between  a  slugger  and  a  boxer.   Grant  is  the  boxer.  You'd  know  that,  just  to  look  at  him.  He's  suave,  distinguished,  graceful  in  every  move  he  makes  before  the  camera.  The  word  "polished"  fits  him  as  closely  as  one  of  his  own  well-fitting  gloves.  And  it's  no  wonder.  His  grandfather  was  an  actor — the  stage  is  in  his  blood.  He's  been  connected  with  the  theater  since  he  was  twelve  years  old,  when  he  ran  away  from  home,  in  England,  to  join  up  with  a  vagabond  troupe  of  acrobat-comedians.    He's  been  in  vaudeville,  he's  been  in  stock  companies,  he  has  played  the  lead  in  a  dozen  operettas  for  the  St.  Louis  Repertoire  Com-  pany. He  was  in  musical  comedy  for  the  Shuberts.  He  made  a  Broadway  success  in  "The  Street  Singer."  The  theater  has  been  his  life.  He  knows  everything  there  is  to  know  about  it.  From  the  tip  of  his  glossy  shoes  to  the  last  curl  of  his  equally  glossy  black  hair,  he's  an  actor.   Gary  Cooper  came  to  Hollywood,  not  from  the  theater,  but  from  a  cattle  ranch.  He  never  acted  in  anything  else  besides  the  movies.  He's  an  ex-cow-puncher,  ex-commercial  artist.  He  lacks,  as  an  actor,  "finesse."  He  doesn't  know  how  to  walk,  doesn't  know  how  to  talk,  doesn't  know  how  to  put  over  a  scene  with  gestures  and  tricks  of  expression,  the  way  a  trained  actor  does.  And  yet  Gary  has  some-  thing that  transcends  finish,  technique.  He  has  one  thing  which  may  prove  stronger  than  all  of  Grant's  polish !   Gary  Cooper  has  personality!   "V/OII  can  learn  technique,  but  you  have  to  be  ■*•  born  with  personality.  Gary  was!  Why,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  he  got  his  original  contract  without  so  much  as  a  screen-test!  He  merely  walked  into  the  office,  and  they  took  one  look  at  him  and  grabbed  for  a  pen.  And  the  public  has  confirmed  that  verdict!  Gary  has  been  tremendously  popular,  and  he  still  is.  He  is  not  adept,  he  is  not  trained,  he  is  not  really  an  actor  at  all — but  when  he  stands  up  before  that  camera,  mama  and  grandma  fall  off  their  seats,  and  pa  and  the  boys  swell  out  their  chests!     That's  personality!   And  that's  the  set-up  for  the  championship  bout  that's  going  on.  It  would  be  a  very  smart  gambler  who  could  lay  odds.  At  present,  true,  Cary  Grant  seems  to  have  the  edge.  But  don't  forget  that,  time  and  time  again,  the  public  has  overwhelmingly  shouted,  "To  heck  with  the  fine  points.  Give  us  personality!"  iVobody  knows  how  it's  going  to  end.  Who  will  win,  the  boxer  or  the  slugger?   It's  a  fair  fight.

They  weren't  "smart."  He  won — the  nooks  nicked  me  only  another  four  hundred  seventy-eight  dollars  and  forty-five  cents.  Later,  when  Lew  Cody  came  with  a  lady,  I  dis-  covered the  why  of  nooks.  And  they  added  a  new  word  to  the  Summerville  vocabulary.  If  I  can't  find  my  hat,  Mrs.  Summerville  will  probably  suggest,  "It  may  be  over  in  the  'Cody.'  "  A  cozy  corner  may  be  a  nook  to  some  people,  but  it's  a  "Cody"  to  us.   JANET  Gaynor  said  it  wouldn't  do  to  panel  the  master  bedroom  with  redwood.  Knotty  pine  was  the  only  thing.  I  had  always  sup-  posed a  knotty  pine  board  had  no  value  ex-  cept in  the  fence  of  a  ball  park.   But  I  found  out  you  pay  these  days  for  knot-  ty pine  at  so  much  per  knot.   Jimmy  Gleason  and  Jimmie  Dunn,  also  knotty  pine  nuts,  held  out  for  it  in  the  living-  room,  too.  California  doesn't  grow  knotty  pine  wide  enough  for  the  living-room  panels.  But  it  could  be  ordered  specially  from  a  lumber  mill  in  Vancouver,  B.  C!   Gary  Cooper — he  got  building  experience  helping  his  father  put  up  a  ranch  barn  once —  suggested   a   second   story.     Just  back   from    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  53  ]    Africa,  he  said  the  best  people  there  were  no  longer  building  one-story  houses.  He  sold  us  the  idea.  (I've  since  learned  they  have  two-  story  houses  in  Africa  on  account  of  snakes.)  Gary's  idea  meant  merely  strengthening  the  foundations — -again — lengthening  the  east  wall  four  feet  and  raising  the  sills  on  the  north  side.   It  was  now  late  in  July.  And  we  had  ex-  pected to  move  in  in  April!   ZaSu  Pitts  discovered  another  terrible  "bull."  Our  bedroom  faced  the  ocean — beau-  tiful view  but  that  was  the  damp  side!  A  fond  mother  of  two  swell  kids,  she  painted  withJier  fluttering  hands  and  face  full  of  maternal  con-  cern, terrifying  pictures  of  babies  with  colds,  croup  and  other  complaints  caused  by  damp  breezes.   So,  for  the  child's  sake  (yes,  we  have  a  baby)  the  bedroom  location  was  changed.  More  plans!   The  architect  went  ZaSu  one  better.  He  beat  someone  to  it  by  finding  some  unused  space — and  a  use  for  it,  a  sleeping  porch  for  the  baby.  This  glass-enclosed  addition  was  four-  teen by  eighteen  feet!  Sally  Eilers  and  her  husband,  Hoot  Gibson,  consoled  by  pointing  out  what  a  chance  it  would  give  the  baby  to  grow!    Will  Rogers  declared  the  place  had  to  have  a  barbecue.  But  the  architect,  always  the  boy  with  big  ideas,  must  have  thought  I  was  going  to  feed  the  American  Legion  or  the  bonus  army  - — I  got  a  barbecue  so  big  it  takes  three  men  to  turn  the  roasting  crank.   C^LARK  Gable,  with  his  mechanical  genius,  ^--'contributed  an  electrical  annunciator  sys-  tem. It's  great.  Push  a  button,  anywhere,  and  every  bell  in  the  house  rings.  The  houseboy,  hearing  the  jingle,  starts  at  the  rear  door  and  works  forward.  In  due  course,  he  is  bound  to  admit  the  caller.   But  I  made  one  slick  contract.  During  the  early  building  stages,  a  man  looked  through  the  first  blue  prints  and  agreed  to  clean  all  the  windows  in  the  completed  house  for  thirty  dollars.  This  bright  young  man  and  a  helper  took  a  week  to  do  their  job.  The  finished  house  has  one  hundred  seven  windows!   What  did  the  place  cost?  Honestly,  I  don't  know.  I  checked  twenty-seven  thousand  dollars  out  of  the  bank  before  I  went  into  a  huddle  with  the  bank  officials.  How  much  was  spent  on  the  house  after  that,  I  haven't  the  slightest  idea  and  I'm  not  trying  to  find  out.  The  bank  will  tell  me — soon  enough!    The  Shadow  Stage    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  59  ]    WILD  HORSE  MESA— Paramount   SUPERB  horsemanship  and  an  exciting  wild  horse  stampede  distinguish  this  Western.  The  hero  is  very  heroic,  the  heroine  is  very  pure,  the  villain  is  very  dastardly,  and  the  story  is  slow  in  spots.  But  that  Randolph  Scott  rides  like  a  Cossack.  The  kids  will  love  it.   MAGIC  NIGHT— United  Artists   THE  star  of  this  English-made  musical  film  is  Jack  Buchanan,  who  did  such  fine  work  with  Jeanette  MacDonald  in  "Monte  Carlo"  that  we  cannot  hold  this  one  against  him.  Be-  sides his  being  miscast,  the  plot  is  artificial  and  the  direction  clumsy.   VIRTUE— Columbia   CAROLE  LOMBARD,  a  "shady  lady,"  mar-  ries taxi  driver  Pat  O'Brien  without  telling  him  about  her  past.  When  he  learns  the  truth  he  forgives  her,  but  nevertheless  is  haunted  by  suspicion.  His  suspicions  reach  a  climax  when  his  wife  is  involved  in  a  murder.  Carole  is  beautiful  as  the  poor  little  misunderstood  Mae  and  Pat  is  excellent  as  the  husband.   THE  MAN  FROM  ARIZONA—  Monogram   "pILLED  with  incongruities  and  improbabili-  -*-  ties,  this  picture's  biggest  dramatic  moment  is  spoiled  by  poor  dialogue.  Neoma  Judge  is  the  vamp  and  Nat  Carr  and  James  Marcus  are  also  in  the  cast.   THE  IRONMASTER— Allied   T^HE  millhand  who  becomes  a  millionaire —  *■  it  could  have  been  a  powerful,  gripping  picture,  but  it  lacks  the  necessary  polish,  and  you  never  quite  believe  in  Reginald  Denny  with  dirt  on  his  hands.  Lila  Lee  doesn't  quite  put  over  her  role,  either.   112    BLAME  THE  WOMAN— Principal   A  DOLPHE  MENJOU  is  his  usual  smooth,  ■*  *-suave  self  in  a  British-made  film  of  two  gentlemen  jewel  thieves  who  are  quite  success-  ful until  the  supposedly  woman-proof  Menjou  is  neatly  double-crossed  by  a  clever  girl  crook.    "Lipstick,  lipstick,  who's  got  the  lip-  stick?" Why,  Anita  Page,  of  course—  and  right  in  the  dashing  silver  orna-  ment that  trims  her  hat.  After  an  ice  cream  soda,  Anita  just  reaches  up,  pulls  out  the  center  of  the  ornament,  and  there's  a  lipstick  all  ready  to  repair  any  damage  that's  been  done    SECRETS  OF  THE  FRENCH  POLICE—  RKO-Radio   1  I  'HIS  picture  is  thrilling,  if  not  convincing.  ■*-  Gwili  Andre,  a  Parisian  flower  girl  hypno-  tized into  posing  as  a  Russian  princess;  Frank  Morgan,  John  Warburton  and  Gregory  Ratoff  play  the  principal  roles.  A  number  of  murders  have  been  committed  and  the  trail  taken  by  the  French  police  is  interesting  to  watch,  though  sometimes  unbelievable.   NO  MORE  ORCHIDS— Columbia   (^AROLE  LOMBARD  with  a  story  and  ^'dialogue  that  fit  like  her  clothes — which  is  some  fit.  Another  rich  girl  who  falls  for  a  poor  lad  and  chases  him  shamelessly,  but  the  treat-  ment is  fresh  and  smart,  and  the  production  has  lots  of  swank.  Lyle  Talbot  gives  an  excel-  lent performance,  and  so  does  Louise  Closser  Hale.  The  rest  of  the  cast  is  good.  A  well-  directed  picture.   GUILTY  OR  NOT  GUILTY—  Monogram   HpHIS  is  melodrama,  but  more  apt  to  bring  ■*-  laughs  than  tears.  It's  all  about  a  girl  who  is  convicted  of  murder,  sent  to  prison  and  through  a  girl  pal  is  freed.  Then  she  gets  in-  volved with  gangsters,  and  a  lot  of  other  things  happen.  Cast  includes  Betty  Compson,  Claudia  Dell  and  Tom  Douglas.   RED-HAIRED  ALIBI— Tower  Prod.    MERNA  KENNEDY  innocently  becomes  the  accomplice  of  a  beer  racketeer.  Only  after  he  kills  a  man  does  she  find  out  who  her  boss  is.  She  deserts  him,  but  later  he  finds  her,  and  in  attempting  to  blackmail  her  he  is  killed.  The  murder  is  traced  to  Merna  but  here  the  story  takes  a  trick  turn  and  all  ends  well.  Theodore  Von  Eltz  makes  a  grand  racketeer  and  Grant  Withers  does  well  in  a  small  role.    MEN  OF  AMERICA— RKO-Radio    A  MILD  little  picture  that  compares  the  trials  of  the  pioneers  and  their  struggles  with  the  Indians  to  the  present-day  invasion  of  the  gangster.  We'll  take  Indians.  Chic  Sale  as  old  Smoky  Joe  adds  a  bit  of  color.  Hero  Bill  Boyd  saves  the  day  and  Dorothy  Wilson  is  the  girl.    Ralph  Ince  makes  a  grand  villain.   DAVID  GOLDER—Vandal-Delac  Prod.   FRENCH,  with  English  sub-titles.  The  bril-  liant acting  of  Harry  Baur  as  David  Colder  makes  it  worth  seeing.  With  great  wealth  amassed,  Goldcr  finds  himself  with  a  faithless  wife,  a  scheming  daughter  and  false  business  partners.     Not  a  happy  story,  but  well  done.   THE  MAN  WITHOUT  A  NAME— UFA   WERNER  KRAUSS,  well-known  German  actor,  has  the  role  of  a  soldier  who  having  lost  his  memory  as  a  result  of  the  war  recovers  it  suddenly  after  a  period  of  seventeen  years,  with  many  resulting  complications.  The  film  is  interesting  but  the  direction  is  lagging.   BARBERINA,  THE  KING'S  DANCER—  Capital  Film   A  GERMAN  talking  picture  handsomely  mounted  and  well  presented.  Lil  Dagover,  recently  seen  in  the  American  picture,  "The  Woman  From  Monte  Carlo,"  plays  a  fiery  ballerina  of  the  Berlin  Opera  House  with  such  glamour  that  one  wonders  if  our  own  Hollywood  did  right  by  her.   HAUNTED   GOLD— Warners   TO  the  thrills  of  a  Western  picture,  this  one  adds  a  dash  of  spookiness.  Sliding  panels  and  secret  entrances  and  a  long-abandoned  mine  in  a  ghost  town,  make  an  unusual  back-  ground for  John  Wayne  and  his  horse,  Duke.  Sheila  Terry  alternately  gets  captured  and  rescued.   COMRADESHIP— Nero  Prod.   A  FASCINATING  realistic  German  film  that  shows  graphically  what  happens  when  men  are  trapped  inside  a  blazing  coal  mine.  It  also  shows  how  true  brotherliness  and  self-  sacrifice  are  brought  out  by  such  tragedies.  An  impressive  film.   ME  AND  MY  GAL— Fox   IF  you  like  rowdy  wisecracks,  seasoned  with  slapstick  and  a  dash  of  melodrama,  you'll  probably  love  this.  Joan  Bennett  as  a  tough  girl  and  Spencer  Tracy  as  the  cop  are  good.  George  Walsh  is  an  excellent  villain  (it's  nice  to  see  him  back  on  the  screen)  and  brother  Raoul  Walsh  did  the  directing.  Marion  Burns,  J.  Farrell  MacDonald  and  Henry  B.  Walthall  give  good  support.

"Let's  forget  it,"  he  said,  and  went  to  Warner  Brothers  where  he  became  a  big  shot.   He  was  a  Hollywood  somebody  in  the  big  money!   Remember  ''Show  of  Shows";  "Under  A  Texas  Moon"  and  those  other  Fay  pictures?   In  the  meantime,  Barbara  had  finished  her  picture.   Disaster!  There  are  not  enough  desolate  adjectives  to  describe  it.   Barbara  also  told  United  Artists,  "Let's  forget  it."   "CRANK  was  not  anxious  for  Barbara  to  work.  •*-  He  had  money.     She  could  stay  home.   But  his  devoted,  husband-sharpened  eye  saw  that  beneath  her  carefully  prepared  I-don't-  care  manner,  she  was  suffering  from  humilia-  tion.   Her  pride  was  injured  and  he  knew  there  is  no  greater  injury  to  woman.   Perhaps,  if  she  could  make  just  one  good  picture —   So  Mr.  on-the-top  Frank  Fay  set  out  to  secure  Miss  down-at-the-bottom  Barbara  Stanwyck  an  opportunity  to  make  another  picture.   The  task  seemed  utterly  impossible  with  "The  Locked  Door"  against  her.   "It  was  as  though  she  had  leprosy  and  everyone  was  afraid  to  even  see  her,"  he  ex-  plains it.   Barbara  still  bites  her  sensitive  lower  lip  when  she  talks  about  it.   "When  you  are  up  in  Hollywood,  you  are  accepted;  when  you  are  down,  it  is  as  though  you  did  not  exist."   When  the  two  attended  Hollywood  parties,  Barbara  would  be  overlooked  as  though  she  were  a  gate-crasher.   Hollywood  has  an  entirely  local  and,  from  the  viewpoint  of  other  localities,  rude  custom.  When  folk  arrive  at  a  party,  men  crowd  into  one  room;  women  into  another.   This  is,  of  course,  to  allow  the  exchange  of  gossip  without  any  restraint  from  the  "other-  sex"  presence.   Three  years  ago  this  New  Year's  eve,  Barbara  attended  a  cocktail  party  preceding  the  Mayfair  celebration.  She  slipped  into  the  room  where  the  one  hundred  women  were  segregated.  There  was  a  French  clock  on  the  mantel.   Out  of  curiosity,  she  timed  her  loneliness.  It  was  exactly  forty-five  minutes  before  one  woman  spoke  to  her.  And  then  it  was  the  wife  of  a  jeweler — not  one  of  Hollywood's  profes-  sionally famous.   Frank  doubled  his  efforts  to  prove  to  Holly-  wood the  capabilities  of  his  wife!   He  propositioned  Harry  Cohn  of  Columbia  studios.   "I  will  pay  half  of  the  production  costs  if  you  will  put  my  wife  in  a  picture.  Only  you  must  promise  not  to  tell  her. "   Barbara  did  not  learn  of  this  until  a  year  and  a  half  later!   She  made  "Mexicali  Rose."   Another  sad  affair.  She  was  to  play  "Ladies  of  Leisure,"  but  when  Director  Frank  Capra  saw  these  first  two  Stanwyck  productions,  he  felt  justified  in  asking  for  another  leading  lady.   FRANK  FAY  made  a  dash  for  Warner  Brothers  studio  where  she  had  made  one  of  her  numerous  tests.   "May  I  borrow  Barbara's  test?"  he  asked  Jack  Warner.  He  rushed  it  to  Columbia  and  showed  it  at  nine  o'clock  that  evening  to  Capra  and  Cohn.   It  was  a  scene  from  "The  Noose,"  which  she  had  done  on  the  stage,  and  proved  her  an  actress.   114    You  know  what  "Ladies  of  Leisure"  did  for  Barbara  Stanwyck  Fay.  The  profits  were  among  the  largest  of  any  "talkie"  to  date.  She  was  a  sensation.  She  had  received  eight  thou-  sand dollars  for  making  it.  They  gave  her  ten  thousand  for  "Ten  Cents  a  Dance."  The  latter  made  even  more  money  than  did  "Ladies  of  Leisure."   And  then  Barbara  was  infected  by  one  of  Hollywood's  earliest  diseases.  Folk  whispered  in  her  ear  that  Ann  Harding  was  making  seven  thousand  five  hundred  a  week,  Connie  Bennett  thirty  thousand,  etc.  Her  producers  whispered  that  the  profits  from  her  picture  had  to  be  carried  in  truck  loads.   Why  shouldn't  she  get  her  fair  share?   She  demanded  fifty  thousand  dollars  for  "Forbidden,"   her  next  picture,   despite   the    From  dancing  in  George  White's  "Scandals"  to  "Walking  Down  Broad-  way"— that's  the  story  of  Boots  Mallory's  career.  Her  real  name  is  Patricia,  and  some  day  we'll  ask  her  how  she  got  that  funny  little  nickname    fact  that  she  was  under  contract  to  make  it  for  ten  thousand.   Columbia  carried  the  matter  into  court —  and  won.   On  the  evening  of  the  court  battle,  Barbara  telephoned  them.  "What  if  you  did  win.  You  can't  make  me  work.  What  are  you  going  to  do  about  it?"   What  they  did — Everyone  got  together.  Frank  said  to  producer  Harry  Cohn,  "You  two  had  better  shake  hands."  They  shook;  made  the  picture.   When  it  was  completed,  Barbara  received  a  whopping-big  bonus.   But  in  the  meantime,  Frank  had  left  Warners.  Frank's  pictures  had  made  a  profit  — but  the  amount  would  not  build  a  new  studio.   Frank  felt  they  were  miscasting  him.  The  studio  insisted  upon  his  interpreting  foreigners.  Mexicans  in  his  first  productions;  Frenchmen  thereafter.   He  was  to  be  the  handsome  hero  designed  to  knock  love-yearning  ladies  unconscious.  His  tousled  red  hair  changed  to  sleek,  oily  blackness.    Only  Frank  didn't  want  to  be  a  foreign-type  lover.   He  wanted  to  be  himself — a  red-headed,  red-  blooded,  Irish  American.   One  word  led  to  a  volume.  Frank  was  out —  and  how!  Hollywood  cattily  said,  "Now  I  guess  Frank  will  have  to  look  to  Barbara — and  how!"   T  HAVE  said , " At  last  the  Barbara-Frank  house  -*-  is  in  order."  In  truth  it  will  never  be  in  order.   Both  are  too  Irishly  tempestuous  to  let  it  remain  that  way.  When  people  become  solidly  stationary,  they  do  not  progress.   Barbara  and  Frank  will  always  be  progress-  ing or  catapulting  backwards — for  the  fun  of  climbing  back  to  the  beyond,  the  point  from  which  they  tumbled.   I  doubt  if  Barbara  will  ever  make  a  story  over  which  she  and  producer  Darryl  Zanuck  do  not  battle.   The  other  day,  Mr.  Zanuck  sent  her  a  note  from  an  important  Eastern  personage  severely  criticizing  Warner  Brothers  for  producing  such  an  inferior  picture  as  "The  Purchase  Price."   "I  chose  that  picture.  How  I  fought  for  it.  I  just  knew  it  would  make  a  good  picture.  There  is  no  one  to  blame  but  me,"  admits  Barbara.   Which  shows  why  no  argument  with  Barbara  is  destructive  or  permanent.  When  she  is  wrong,  she  admits  it.   But  to  think  of  these  two  maintaining  an  in-  order  house — forever!   Not  even  the  baby  can  do  it.  They  adopted  him  because  they  love  children.  Barbara  was  an  orphan  in  the  days  when  orphans  were  treated  more  cruelly  than  lost  puppies  are  today.   She  would  like  to  adopt  all  orphans  and  surround  them  with  the  happiness  of  which  she  was  herself  deprived.  She  is  going  to  adopt  more.   Many  more.   Yet,  I  repeat,  even  children  will  not  stand-  ardize her  life — or  Frank's.   Listen  to  Frank  and  Barbara  explain  it.  Frank  says:   "I  like  pictures  better  than  any  business  in  the  world  because  it  is  like  a  crap  game.  Con-  tinual excitement  and  action.   "You  can  never  foretell  tomorrow.  You  may  take  a  trip  to  Palm  Springs.  The  butler  will  ask  for  your  name  at  your  own  door  when  you  return.  Whenever  you  leave  Hollywood,  you  are  forgotten.  You  return  to  start  all  over."   BARBARA  interrupted.  "Just  like  this  house.  We've  completed  everything  exactly  as  we  want  it.  Spanish.  But  any  bright  morning,  Frank  may  wake  up  and  say,  'What  I  really  wanted  was  an  English  house.'  By  noon,  there  will  be  seventy-five  workmen  swarming  over  the  place."   "Sure,  it  will  give  us  something  to  do."  "See?"  Barbara's  laugh  floated  out  over  the  Spanish  balcony  to  the  Spanish  swimming  pool,  bungalow  dressing-rooms  and  gym-  nasium. "  I  just  knew  it  was  coming.  Then,  I  might  want  Italian — "   "Then,  we'd  do  it  again,  darling."  "We'll  probably  end  by  starving."  "But  we'll  starve  in  a  nice  house,  honey."  Which  explains,  of  course,  why  Hollywood  is  always  talking  about  them.     They  are  mag-  netically, robustly,  topsy-turvily  vital  and  in-  teresting.   Who  ever  wastes  time  gossiping  about  dull  people?   And  it  also  explains  why  they  are  the  happiest  married  couple  I  know  in  Hollywood.  They  are  never  dull  to  each  other.

OPPORTUNITY   The  Magazine  That  Finds  Jobs  and  Teaches  Salesmanship   919-PA   N.  Michigan  Ave.,  CHICAGO    She  Stole  His  Best  Scenes    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  82]    knotted  in  a  huge  piece  at  the  back,  and  rushed  her  to  the  barber.   Not  since  her  childhood,  when  as  a  freckle-  faced  tomboy  she  had  re-named  herself  "James"  and  persuaded  one  of  her  brothers  to  take  her  to  the  barber  shop  for  a  boy's  hair  cut,  had  a  scissors  touched  her  hair.  She  had  passed  safely  through  that  hysterical  era  when,  "My  dear,  you  must  cut  your  hair,"  was  on  every  tongue,  only  to  have  it  off  without  even  a  chance  for  argument,  the  first  hour  in  Hollywood.   T  ATE  that  evening,  she  timidly  asked  if  she  -^-'could  go  to  a  doctor  to  have  the  splinter  removed  from  her  eye.   An  hour  later  Miss  Katharine  Hepburn,  bright  star  of  the  Broadway  stage,  found  her-  self, shorn  and  with  a  big  black  patch  protect-  ing one  eye,  alone  and  deserted  on  Hollywood's  doorstep.   She  became  quickly  acclimated  to  the  studio,  but  in  the  breakfast  scene  of  "A  Bill  of  Divorcement"  she  had  considerable  dialogue  and  stage  "business"  and  she  wasn't  doing  it  right.   She  talked  too  fast  for  recording;  she  moved  too  quickly.   She  could  never  quite  manage  to  walk  around  and  land  back  in  the  chalk  marks  the  director  had  designated  as  the  spot  for  the  action  to  climax.   It  was  all  too  new  to  an  actress  accustomed  only  to  the  wide  sweep  of  a  stage.  She  protes-  ted she  was  too  tall  (she's  five  foot,  five  and  a  half)  to  catch  a  glimpse  of  those  chalk  marks  without  deliberately  looking  down!   They  took  that  scene  exactly  twenty-five  times,  not  counting  rehearsals.   Twenty-five  times  that  morning  Miss  Hep-  burn ate  her  portion  of  scrambled  eggs,  and  couldn't  even  bear  to  look  at  an  egg  for  months  after.    But  no  one  scolded.  Not  even  the  com-  missary department!   With  a  friend  she  saw  the  first  "rushes"  of  her  scenes.   Turning  to  the  girl  she  said,  "Frankly,  I'm  bored.  I  think  they're  pretty  bad.'V  "So  am  I  and  so  do  I, "  the  friend  just  as  frankly  ad-  mitted.   They  left  the  projection  room  without  wait-  ing for  more.   The  picture  finished,  she  left  for  a  vacation  in  Europe.   Friends  cabled  her  about  the  brilliant  New  York  opening  but  neglected  to  send  her  the  critics'  notices.   No  one  told  her  she  had  been  hailed  as  a  sensation.   So  it  wasn't  until  Radio  Pictures  cabled  her  to  hurry  back  for  "Three  Came  Unarmed,"  that  she  knew  she  was  good  enough  to  go  on  in  movies.   She  returned  from  Europe  as  a  first-class  passenger  because  she  thought  newspaper  and  cameramen  might  think  it  a  pose  if  she  fol-  lowed her  usual  custom  of  traveling  steerage.  No,  not  third-class,  but  steerage.  That's  the  way  she  went  over.  That's  the  way  she  has  crossed  eight  times.   "T  TRAVELED  steerage  because  I  was  always  ■*■  seasick  and  didn't  get  any  fun  out  of  the  voyage.  The  food  isn't  so  good,  but  I  couldn't  eat,  anyhow.  I'm  afraid  the  spell  is  broken  now.  I  didn't  know  what  comfort  I  was  miss-  ing until  I  came  back  first-class."   People  are  comparing  her  to  Greta  Garbo,  because  she  is  like  her  photographically.  Garbo,  too,  is  tall  and  thin — Miss  Hepburn  weighs  only  107  pounds.  Garbo  has  the  same  broad  brow  and  high  cheekbones,  the  same  delicate  yet  square  face,  the  same  full  mouth  and  heavy-lidded  eyes.   Miss  Hepburn  says,  "Garbo's  eyes  are  di-    A  new  starring  team.  Katharine  Hepburn  and  Joel  McCrea  are  making  "Three  Came  Unarmed."  It's  Katharine's  second  screen  adventure,  following  her  interesting  portrayal  of  Sydney  in  "A  Bill  of  Divorcement"    Photoplay  Magazine  for  January,  1933    II7    Georgie  Raft's  name  is  coupled  with  a  different  girl  every  week,  but  when  this  was  snapped  at  the  Frolics,  Edith  Roarke  seemed  to  be  getting  his  un-  divided attention.  Edith  is  a  fascinat-  ing dancer  in  "The  Kid  From  Spain"    vine.  They  are  beautiful  and  large.  That's  where  we  differ  greatly."   It's  a  funny  thing  about  those  Hepburn  eyes.  Light  in  color — a  turquoise  blue — not  specially  large  or  provocative.  Yet  on  the  screen  they  seem  liquid  and  dark,  the  lids  heavier,  the  pupils  larger.   SHE  is  a  real  Garbo  fan  herself  and  shies  away  from  comparisons.  "Because  we  are  not  really  alike  at  all,"  she  says.  "Garbo  has  that  Duse  quality,  that  deep  under-current  of  tragedy,  the  beautiful  repose  and  repression  that  belong  to  her  race.  I'm  just  an  average  sort  of  American  girl  who  likes  to  talk  too  much  and  who  moves  quickly  and  energetical-  ly."   Katharine  Hepburn's  ancestry  is  Scotch  and  so  is  her  appearance.   Her  face  is  covered  with  light  freckles;  her  teeth  are  white  and  perfect)  and  she  could  chal-  lenge Dietrich's  title  to  the  most  beautiful  legs  in  Hollywood.   Her  father  is  a  surgeon  in  their  home  city  of  Hartford,  Conn.,  and  she  has  three  older  brothers  and  two  younger  sisters.   She  is  in  her  early  twenties;  athletic — the  runner-up  in  a  Connecticut  golf  tournament  some  years  ago.   She  is  being  criticized  for  keeping  her  per-  sonal life  in  the  background  and  accused  of  imitating  Garbo  in  her  reticence  to  discuss  it.  She  won't  deny  or  admit  her  marriage  of  sev-  eral years  ago  to  Ludlow  O.  Smith.  So  far  as  the  picture  world  is  concerned,  Mr.  Smith  ap-  pears to  be  a  shadowy  figure  engaged  in  the  insurance  business — the  scion  of  an  old  Phila-  delphia family.   "DUT  what  you'll  be  interested  in  knowing  at  ■'-'this  moment  is  that  she  will  make  two  pic-  tures a  year  for  a  period  of  five  years.

Meet  the  Monster!    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  60    Most  of  us  by  then  would  have  had  a  heart  that  growled!   Another  theatrical  job.  Again  another  com-  pany went  broke.   The  tantalizing  aromas  wafted  from  res-  taurants, the  trunk  held  by  a  hotel  manager,  have  inspired  many  an  artist  to  forsake  his  ideal  and  sell  short  to  dull  methodical  routine.   Not  Karloff!  Repeated  adversity  served  only  to  sharpen  his  determination.  He  could  not  stoop  to  bribe  his  ambition  with  any  little  victory,  any  half -measure,  with  its  inevitable  result — efficient  mediocrity.   He  had  pried  in  the  opening  wedge  and  he  was  going  on.   By  gradual  stages,  he  achieved  Hollywood  and  success.  But  it  took  exactly  fourteen  years.   THE  story  of  those  fourteen  years  is  a  docu-  mentof  human  endurance  tried  to  the  break-  ing point.  Of  determination  and  desperation  seldom  equalled  in  the  history  of  any  career  in  any  field.   This  man  had  a  background  of  rich  expe-  rience. Nine  years  in  stock  is  as  fine  an  appren-  ticeship as  any  actor  can  serve.  He  had  been  in  every  conceivable  situation  demanding  re-  sourcefulness, intelligence,  and  ability.  He  had  worked  at  persecuting,  sordid  labor,  with  the  physical  tension  unrelieved  for  months  at  a  time.  It  never  broke  his  spirit,  never  swerved  him  a  fraction  from  the  central  path  toward  his  goal.   He  thought  all  this  preparation  would  mean  something  in  Hollywood.  But  Karloff  knew  very  little  about  the  Village  of  Diminishing  Averages.   He  had  to  fight  even  for  extra  work.  A  few  months  of  that,  and  he  advanced  tortuously  out  of  that  rank  of  forgotten  men  by  sheer  force  of  dynamic  personality.  They  couldn't  ignore  him.  ,   He  was  too  stirring,  too  vivid,  with  his  mys-  terious swarthy  face,  his  deep,  burning  mag-    So  Jimmy  Durante  "ups"  to  Viola  Dana  and  Shirley  Mason  and  reads  them  the  funny  papers!  But  they  don't  seem  to  be  laughing  very  hard.  Oh,  how  mortifyin'!  Jimmy's  next  pictuie  is  "Pig  Boats,"  which  is  a  pet  name  for  submarines,  we're  told    netic  eyes,  his  long  eloquent  hands.  He  was  "color"  made  articulate.   At  last  elevated  to  his  first  "bit"  part,  be  clung  to  that  meagre  foothold.  He  determined  that  he  would  not  slip  back  into  "extra"  ob-  scurity.   It  was  an  aching  temptation  to  take  the  five  dollars  a  day,  when  calls  went  out  for  mob-  stuff  and  he  had  been  a  long  time  "between  pictures" — and  meals.  But  he  knew  it  meant  losing  that  precious  stride  forward,  and  he  clung  to  it  with  unflinching  singleness  of  pur-  pose.   In  the  face  of  desperate  need,  actual  hunger,  he  held  out  grimly.   Once  reduced  to  crowd  work  again,  he  might  never  emerge.  He  had  seen  that  happen  to  other  men.  Had  seen  it  take  the  hope  out  of  them,  like  taking  away  a  soldier's  stripes,  and  ambition  dwindled  steadily  until  the  man  was  finally  defeated  by  the  imperative  necessity  of  maintaining  life.  At  the  cost  of  his  once  fine  pride  and  vaulting  ambition.   If  he  went  back,  Karloff  knew  he  might  be  just  another  extra  for  the  rest  of  his  life.   "T/'ARLOFF  located  a  job  driving  a  truck.  -^-The  job  started  the  following  Monday,  and  in  the  meantime,  he  had  to  learn  how  to  drive.  Monday  came.  He  drove  the  seventeen-ton  truck.  He  loaded,  unloaded,  and  piloted  this  juggernaut  for  one  year.   The  manager  understood  his  situation  and  let  him  off  for  the  necessary  few  days  when-  ever picture  work  came  up.   But  when  one  picture  lasted  ten  days,  they  finally  had  to  give  the  trucking  job  to  another  man.   Around  this  time,  Karloff  met  and  married  his  first  wife,  Polly.   The  introspective,  analytical,  serious  man —  and  Polly,  the  blonde  Fanchon-Marco  danc-  ing girl.   Frivolity  wedded  to  the  Three  Fates.  .  .  .  Red  heels  in  a  cathedral.   The  contrast  obviously  was  marked  for  dis-  aster from  the  first.  After  a  time,  Polly  simply  went  to  Panama  as  a  cafe  entertainer.  Divorce  followed.   One  night,  Karloff  saw  a  picture  called  "The  Penalty."  Lon  Chaney's  brilliant  artistry  made  such  a  vivid  impression  upon  him  that  he  wandered  around  for  days  like  a  man  under  a  spell  of  enchantment,  hypnotized.   His  ambition  given  added  impulse  by  Cha-  ney's performance,  Karloff  made  a  fresh  round  of  the  studios.  Someone  called  to  him  from  a  passing  car.  At  first  Karloff  did  not  recog-  nize the  man,  his  ideal,  who  remembered  an  insignificant  bit  Karloff  had  done  in  one  of  his  pictures.   Chaney,  an  extraordinarily  gracious  and  kindly  man,  gave  him  a  lift.  They  drove  around  for  an  hour.   Chaney  was  interested  in  Karloff's  reactions  to  his  "Penalty"  performance  and  in  his  in-  telligent comments.  They  took  the  picture  scene  by  scene,  analyzed  it  together.   THE  discussion  was  inspiring  to  the  unknown  actor.  He  did  not  know  that  he  was  one  day  fated  to  occupy  the  position  left  vacant  when  Chaney  died.   He  never  strolled  idly  down  the  boulevard  again.  Chaney  told  him  a  man  needed  to  be  alone,  that  idle  chatter  was  disorganizing.  So  Karloff  roamed  the  hills  back  of  Hollywood,  avoiding  the  discouraging  complaints  of  boule-  vard loafers.   The  turning  point  came  when  he  went  to  the  Actor's  Equity  office  one  day  for  his  English  mail.  At  the  foot  of  the  stairs  he  paused  and  thought  how  futile  it  was  to  climb  the  long  flight.     He  had  been  there  the  previous  day.    He  debated  whether  to  inquire  or  go  on  for  his  walk.  Something  urged  him  up  the  stairs.  There  was  no  mail — but  the  girl  at  the  desk  told  him  that  a  downtown  theater  was  casting  a  play  called,  "The  Criminal  Code."   He  landed  an  important  part  and  played  it  superbly.  Later,  a  picture  version  was  made  and  he  was  cast  in  the  same  part.  Things  be-  gan to  move.   SHORTLY  after,  Carl  Laemmle,  Jr., decided  he  was  the  man  for  "  Frankenstein.  "  Karloff  ignited  the  imagination  of  a  great  public  with  that  astounding  performance.  In  it,  he  ar-  rived.   You  know  the  rest.   He  fought  a  long  time  for  his  break.  He  en-  dured more  than  the  average  person  can  com-  prehend, and  there  are  chapters  in  his  life  he  does  not  dwell  upon.  His  is  a  saga  of  suffering,  of  hard-earned  recognition.  He  survived  years  of  famine,  thwarted  ambition,  thankless  devo-  tion; he  does  not  know  what  invisible  force  stimulated  him — but  even  he  would  not  do  it  again.   And  with  it  all,  his  most  astonishing  personal  characteristic  is  the  fact  that  he  is  a  man  with-  out a  grievance.  It  seems  that  the  people  who  work  hardest  for  their  success  harbor  the  few-  est grudges.   Karloff  has  learned  there  is  nothing  in  life  worth  growing  bitter  about.   Now  he  has  been  married  for  three  years  to  a  charming,  cultured  girl  who  was  a  librarian  in  the  city  schools.    They  are  ideally  happy.   He  has  earned  the  repose  and  serenity  of  his  lovely  quiet  home  on  Toluca  Lake.  He  has  suffered  none  of  the  usual  symptoms  of  picture  success.  He  drives  a  battered  old  Ford  coupe,  and  his  friends  are  the  same  ones  he  made  fourteen  years  ago  when  he  arrived  in  Hollywood.   Boris  Karloff  set  a  mark  for  himself,  and  he  made  it.   But  what  a  price  he  paid!

Hotel  Sherman,   Chicago     .     415  Greenwich   St.,  ISew  York    Did  Garbo  Marry  Stiller?    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  48  ]    An  admirer  of  Stiller's  ?  Unquestionably  again.  It  was  Stiller  who  guided  her  upwards,  fought  many  of  her  battles  for  her.  There  is  no  reason  to  believe  Garbo  will  ever  forget  that.  Whether  she  has  put  aside  all  thoughts  of  marriage  because  of  her  memory  of  Stiller,  or  because  she  was  at  one  time  married  to  him,  is  another  matter  entirely.   T_J"OW  profound  Garbo's  impression  of  Stiller  •*■  -*-must  have  been,  as  the  groundwork  of  her  attitude  toward  him,  is  indicated  nicely  in  a  Swedish  writer's  account  of  her  first  meeting  with  the  director.  The  quotes  which  the  Swedish  writer  gives  as  those  of  Garbo  may  not  be  exact.  I  merely  present  them  as  they  stand.   "I  went  up  to  find  him  after  school,"  is  the  way  the  writer  quotes  Garbo.  "I  had  never  seen  Stiller.  I  had  only  heard  and  read  of  him,  but  I  had  much  respect  for  him  and  he  was  to  me  a  great  man.   "He  wasn't  in  when  I  arrived  and  I  sat  down  to  wait.    He  came  in  finally  with  his  big    dog.  He  struck  me  as  so  different  from  other  men,  so  original.  Without  saying  a  word  he  looked  at  me  a  long  time,  surveying  me  from  head  to  foot.  A  long  time  afterwards  he  told  me  exactly  what  I  wore  that  day,  even  what  kind  of  shoes  and  stockings.  Black,  low-heeled  shoes  and  black  stockings.  Then  he  said  something  about  the  weather  and  other  small  topics.  At  times  I  thought  he  wasn't  even  looking  at  me.   "Then  he  said,  suddenly,  'Can  you  take  off  your  hat  and  coat?'  I  took  them  off,  feeling  that  he  was  watching  my  every  movement.  Then  he  asked  for  my  telephone  number,  and  that  was  the  end  of  the  interview."   This,  then,  is  the  story  of  Stiller  and  Garbo,  out  of  which  has  come  the  rumor  of  marriage.  The  facts  are  worthy  of  speculation,  for  it  is  possible  that  Garbo  spent  more  time  in  the  company  of  Stiller  than  with  any  one  man  before  or  since.  And  there  are  rumors  that  certain  papers  have  been  signed  in  Stockholm  regarding  Garbo's  status  as  a  Swedish  subject  and  regarding  her  sojourn  in  America.     The    papers  may  have  something  to  do  with  Stiller  and  they  may  not.  For  the  time  being  there  is  no  way  of  telling.  The  burden  of  proof  seems  very  much  against  it.   As  I  write  this  in  Stockholm,  a  new  rumor  is  afloat  here.  This  time  the  story  is  that  Prince  Lennart,  who  married  outside  of  royalty  last  spring  and  who  is  now  known  as  Lennart  Bernadotte,  has  written  a  special  play  in  which  Garbo  will  act  at  a  small  theater  in  Stockholm  in  which  she  is  supposed  to  have  a  financial  interest.   •"THE  director  of  the  theater,  a  woman,  a  *■  friend  of  Garbo's,  has  denied  knowledge  of  any  such  plans;  has  denied  that  Garbo  has  an  interest  in  the  theater.   It's  much  the  same  thing  over  again.  Some-  one putting  six  and  seven  together  and  trying  to  make  twelve.  It  may  get  to  be  twelve,  but  it  isn't  for  the  time  being.   Did  Garbo  marry  Stiller?   The  several  enterprising  journalists  may  think  so,  but  they  can't  prove  it.    Three  Ring  Circus  of  '32    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  35    five  thousand  dollars  and  Radio  Pictures  buys  it  for  Connie  Bennett,  whereupon  Gloria  is  out  cold  for  three  days  at  the  news.  The  Malibu  season  opens  and  the  Malibu  Follies  begin.   Now  the  lights  dim  and  the  place  is  sud-  denly filled  with  terror.  In  two  seconds  the  stage  is  cleared  as  an  eerie,  ghostly  shadow  creeps  on.   Kidnappers  threaten  the  town.   Windows  are  barred.  Guards  are  placed  and  the  menace  slinks  away.   From  every  corner  comes  the  cry,  "Is  Garbo  going?  Is  Garbo  coming  back?"  while  snoop  sisters  and  scoop  sisters  run  in  and  out  writing  down  wrong  names  at  right  addresses.   MaryPickford  goes  driving  along  the  boule-  vard counting  empty  storerooms  and  wrecks  the  west  end  of  the  boulevard  and  the  east  end  of  Chico,  Miriam  Hopkins  adopts  a  baby,  buys  a  farm  and  divorces  a  husband  all  in  one  week,  Ralph  Forbes  goes  to  Reno,  his  wife,  Ruth  Chatterton,  goes  to  Spain  and  George  Brent  goes  to  vaudeville.  Von  Sternberg  and  Diet-  rich make  faces  at  Paramount  and  Paramount  makes  faces  right  back.  A  blonde  by  the  name  of  Venus  is  the  cause.   A  COOL  little  egg  flips  a  coin  all  through  •*»■"  Scarf  ace"  and  finds  himself  in  the  front  ring.  Georgie  Raft  makes  a  hit.  A  quick  flash  back  reveals  the  Barrymores  still  making  "  Ras-  putin "  with  not  a  Barrymore  left  on  speaking  terms.  Out  of  nowhere  a  mysterious  car  glides  up  to  the  home  of  Irving  Thalberg.  A  tall  figure  steals  in.  Garbo  has  come  to  sign  that  new  contract.   Buster  Keaton  buys  a  yacht  on  wheels,  two  admiral  suits  and  with  Lew  Cody  goes  driving  about  the  country  astonishing  the  natives  into  hysterics.   Pickford  decides  on  "Secrets"  after  all,  and  Ann  Dvorak  leaves  Hollywood  flat.  With  Leslie  Fenton.  Connie  Bennett  refuses  to  see  twenty-nine  reporters,  seven  columnists,  and  twelve  sob  sisters,  and  loses  eight  pounds,  while  a  strange  mannish  figure  steals  quietly  out  of  the  depot  gates.  Unnoticed,  Garbo  has  gone.   The  polo  chorus,  including  Will  Rogers,  Clark  Gable,  Bob  Montgomery  and  Spencer   120    Tracy,  trot  out  in  polo  pants  that  would  slay  a  potato-bug  and  do  a  quaint  folk  dance  on  horseback.  They  think,  however,  it's  polo  and  practically  nobody  knows  the  difference.  The  Marx   Brothers  disrobe  a  producer  in  broad    That  serious  bull-fight  scene  in  "The  Kid  From  Spain"  is  the  real  McCoy.  Sidney  Franklin,  one  of  the  world's  great  bull-fighters,  visited  his  friend  Eddie  Cantor  in  Hollywood  and  stayed  to  make  a  thrilling  sequence  in  Eddie's      uproarious     new     picture    daylight  on  his  own  lot,  while  Marlene  and  Von  Sternberg  quarrel  and  make  up  and  Mar-  lene paralyzes  the  diners  by  appearing  in  the  studio  dining-room  in  a  nickel's  worth  of  shorts  with  bare  legs  exposed.  Even  the  Marx  Brothers  were  carried  out  in  a  body.   The  loud  rasping  sound  proves  to  be  Lionel  Barrymore  asleep  and  snoring  on  sister  Ethel's  lap  on  the  "Rasputin"  set  that  just  goes  on  and  on,  and  Mary  Pickford  decides  to  make  "Shanty  Town"  after  all.   ■"THE  hunting  scene  takes  place.  The  stage  is  •*■  darkened  and  into  the  gloom  steals  Mary  Pickford,  Sam  Katz  from  Paramount,  Junior  Laemmle  from  Universal  and  Irving  Thalberg  from  M-G-M,  Harpo  Marx  and  Chic  Sale  all  carrying  lanterns,  while  in  the  distance  comes  the  gay  lilt  of  "A-hunting  we  will  (gulp,  whistle)  go,"  sung  by  Bing  Crosby  who  arrived  on  the  afternoon  train.   The  hunters  wave  their  lanterns  and  go  chasing  madly  about.  Mary  Pickford  hunts  for  a  leading  man  for  "Secrets,"  I  mean  "Shanty  Town,"  no  "Secrets,"  no — aw  nuts,  — Sam  Katz  hunts  for  a  "Panther  Woman"  and  a  "Lion  Man,"  Irving  Thalberg  for  a  Red-  Headed  Woman,  Junior  Laemmle  for  a  Laugh-  ing (tee  heej  Boy,  Harpo  Marx  for  a  small  house  with  a  big  swimming  pool.   M-G-M  mistakes  a  platinum  blonde  for  a  red-head,  while  Junior  Laemmle  gives  up  the  "Laughing  Boy"  picture  in  disgust  and  runs  home  to  make  more  horrors.   Constance  Bennett's  first  "Rockabye"  has  to  be  re-made  and  Gloria  Swanson  rolls  about  on  good  old  English  soil  in  mirth.  Heigh-ho,  the  dairy-o,  the  "Farmer's"  in  the  dell!   As  though  by  a  bolt  from  above,  the  circus  of  Hollywood  freezes  to  a  standstill.  Paul  Bern  has  taken  his  life.  His  wife,  the  platinum-  headed  Jean  Harlow,  is  laid  low  in  grief.  Hollywood  weeps  in  sympathy.   Reporters  and  the  everlasting  sob  sisters  own  crowd  the  gate  of  the  depot.  John  Gilbert  and  his  bride,  Virginia  Bruce,  are  off  to  Europe.   Chatterton  comes  home  from  Spain.  Forbes  from  Reno  and  Brent  from  vaudeville.  The  cards  have  been  shuffled.  Chatterton  is  now  Mrs.  Brent  and  they  all  have  tea  to  celebrate.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  January,  1933    1  21    Then  Brent  goes  broad  "a,"  Forbes  goes  wild-  cat hunting  and  Chatterton  goes  right  on  with  her  gum-chewing.   A  quick  flash  reveals  the  Barrymores  still  disputin'  over  "  Rasputin,"  and  Jimmy  Cagney  comes  home.  OS  in  the  distance  a  cow  pony  kicks  up  the  dust  as  Clara  Bow  rides  back  from  her  desert  home  to  make  another  picture  just  as  Alice  White  arrives  at  the  depot  gate  for  the  same  purpose.  Fox  decides  to  co-star  Will  Rogers  and  Blue  Boy,  the  prize  hog.  'While  Charlie  Chaplin  lets  out  a  fatherly  plea  that  keeps  his  boys  from  movies.  After  years  of  threatening,  Joan  Crawford  makes  for  Europe  with  Doug,  Jr.,  following  "Rain."   DIETRICH  puts  on  men's  trousers,  tie,  shirts  and  shorts  and  steals  Garbo's  thunder.  While  Von  Sternberg  takes  one  look  and  sails  for  the  South  Seas  to  hunt  a  typhoon.  And  this  with  a  town  full  of  windstorms.   The  sob  sisters  now  all  join  hands  and  come  skipping  in  singing,  "We're  the  scoopa,  boopa,  doop  sisters."   Claudette  Colbert  waves  good  morning  to  hubby  Norman  Foster,  who  lives  on  the  next  hill  and  Mary  Pickford  positively  decides  on  "Shanty  Town."   With  a  blasting  of  trumpets  and  crashing  of  cymbals,  De  Mille  (with  puttees)  returns  to  the  scene  leading  a  chorus  of  twenty-seven  yes  men.  They  immediately  go  into  a  historical  rhumba  with  Cecil  leading  the  intricate  steps  into  the  lion's  den.   The  rotund  Charles  Laughton,  as  Nero,  wrapped  in  a  sheet,  goes  flying  about  the  Para-  mount lot  on  a  bicycle.  While  Cecil  sings,  "Turn  on  the  gas,  turn  on  the  gas,  make  it  hot  and  snappy,  but  turn  on  the  gas."  For  Rome,  this  time  is  burned  with  gas,  while  Claudette  Colbert  takes  a  milk  bath  that  turns  to  cottage  cheese  in  the  heat.  Off  in  the  hills,  two  lanterns  are  seen  bobbing  about  in  the  distance.  Harpo  Marx  still  hunts  for  a  small  house  with  a  large  swimming  pool  and  Mary  Pickford  still  searches  for  a  leading  man.   Ronnie  Colman  gets  mad  at  Sammy  Gold-  wyn  and  sues  Sammy  for  all  his  dough.  Sammy's  that  surprised  you  could  knock  him  down  with  a  feather.  Jimmy  Cagney  goes  back  to  work,  tickled  pink,  Clark  Gable  has  been  chased  through  all  three  rings  by  every  leading  lady,  for  their  pictures,  and  then  Hollywood  goes  political.   "  We  want  Hoover,"  screams  Louie  B.  Mayer.   "We  want  Roosevelt,"  scream  practically  all  of  Mrs.  Warner's  little  boys.   Then  Roosevelt  comes  to  town,  the  town  (all  but  M-G-M)  slings  a  parade  and  nobody  wants  anybody  by  the  time  it's  over.   MARIE  DRESSLER  waves  a  hand  from  her  seat  in  the  front  ring.  The  whole  circus  pauses  a  moment  to  gaze  upon  Marie  whose  steps  falter  just  a  little  more,  but  whose  smile  is  just  as  sweet.   Ethel  Barrymore  says,  "That's  all  there  is,  there  isn't  any  more,"  and  goes  back  to  New  York,  Rome  goes  right  on  being  gassed,  the  English  Herbert  Marshall  and  Leslie  Howard  arrive,  setting  the  natives  dizzy,  while  George  Raft  is  the  first  man  to  take  a  bath  on  the  screen.   Richard  Bennett  displays  his  hand-painted  toe-nails,  works  jig-saw  puzzles  and  razzes  daughter  Connie,  all  at  the  same  party.  The  Stu  Erwins  and  Helen  Twelvetrees  get  them-  selves brand-new  babies,  when  who  comes  to  town  with  ears,  neck  and  fingers  blazing,  but  Mae  West,  good  old  Diamond  Lil  herself.   And  then  in  the  stillness  of  the  night  a  new  menace  creeps  on.   Thieves.   And  when  they  depart,  Zeppo  Marx  is  stripped  clean,  and  her  monkey  swallows  the  only  diamond  Mae  West  has  left.   Night  clubs  open  and  night  clubs  close,  the  Palm  Springs  desert  season  is  on  again  and  once  more  Jimmy  Durante  is  on  his  way  to  sit  on  a  cactus.  And  just  as  the  curtain  is  slowly  lower-  ing the  scene  flashes  back  to  find  Lionel  Barry-  more  asleep  on  John's  lap  while  "Rasputin"  goes  on  and  on  and  on.

But  gums  need  stimulation  and  exercise  to  keep  in  condition — to  continue  healthy  and  hard.  And  our  present-day  foods  are  much  too  soft  to  give  them  the  stimulation  they  actually  need.   From  being  hard  and  sound,  your  gums  weaken  and  deteriorate — become  flabby  and  tender.  They  develop  a  tendency  to  bleed,  and  that  "tinge  of  pink"  on  your  tooth  brush  gives  you  your  first  warning  of  serious  trouble  ahead.    Ipana   TOOTH  PASTE    A  Good  Tooth  Paste,  like  a  Good  Dentist,  is  never  a  luxury    Do  something  about  those  tender  gums  of  yours.  Heed  that  telltale  warning  "pink  tooth  brush."  For  ignored,  it  may  lead  to  gingivitis,  Vincent's  disease  or  the  dread  but  rare  pyorrhea.  Neglected,  it  may  even  threaten  good,  sound  teeth.   Check  "pink  tooth  brush"  now.  You  can't  afford  to  delay,  and  the  treatment  is  so  simple  and  takes  so  little  time.   Get  a  tube  of  Ipana  at  your  druggist's  today.  Clean  your  teeth  with  it  twice  every  single  day.  First  of  all,  Ipana  is  a  splendid  modern  tooth  paste.  Its  flavor  is  refreshing.    And  it  does  clean  your  teeth  thoroughly —  brightens  and  whitens  them.   But  it  does  more.  Each  time  you  clean  your  teeth,  rub  a  little  more  Ipana  into  your  flabby,  lazy  gums.  Massage  it  in  lightly  and  don't  rinse  it  off — leave  it  there.  Ipana  contains  ziratol,  and  ziratol  left  on  the  gums  works  with  the  massage  to  correct  that  soft,  unhealthy  condition.   Schedule  this  treatment  for  your  gums.  In  a  month  they  will  be  firmer,  healthier.  Keep  on  with  Ipana  and  massage — and  you  can  forget  "pink  tooth  brush."

Paul  Muni's  superb  acting  and  its  heart-rending  frankness  bring  "I  Am  a  Fugitive  From  a  Chain  Gang"  most  applause  from  readers.  Added  to  strong  cinema  red  meat,  audiences  find  the  picture  to  be  a  powerful  sermon  against  crime  and  a  spotlight  on  an  appalling  penal  problem  of  today    THE  $25  LETTER   I  recently  returned  from  my  first  trip  to  New  York.  I  expected  to  find  myself  awed  and  sur-  prised— a  strange  man  in  a  strange  town.  But  I  found  New  York  curiously  familiar.   Broadway — a  million  lights — skyscrapers —  crowds — these  were  neither  strange  sights  nor  strange  noises  to  me.  I  had  seen  all  this  many  times  in  the  movies  back  home.   Then  the  Bowery  and  Chinatown.  The  spieler  did  not  need  to  point  out  interesting  sights  to  me.  I  knew  what  to  expect  and  was  not  disappointed.   Then  I  went  to  a  night  club.  No  surprise,  everything  as  I  expected.  My  check  was  the  real  surprise.  I  went  to  a  movie  where  I  would  see  something  new.   I  saw  few  things  in  New  York  that  I  had  not  seen  portrayed  many  times  on  the  screen  and  accurately,  too.  I  don't  travel  much  but  I  go  to  the  movies  often  and  I  feel  that  I  have  acquired  an  education  and  have  seen  the  world  — from  the  screen.

(And  hence  these  "literary"  roses)   Marie  Dressler.  Who  reeled  as  Marthy  through  the  play  Of  "Anna  Christie" — in  her  way  "Outgarboed"  Garbo?    Who?

Who  is  it  really  satisfies?   6    Because  in  human  lore  she's  wise  Above  all  other  movie  guys?  Marie  Dressler.   L'Envoi  Go  on,  Marie,  for  years  and  years.  Moving  us  now  to  smiles,  now  tears.  Fame  cannot  spoil  you — we've  no  fears,  Marie  Dressler.   Mignon  Quaw  Lott,  Baton  Rouge,  La.    NOT  a  single  adverse  criticism  is  there  on  "I  Am  a  Fugitive  From  a  Chain  Gang,"  nor  on  Paul  Muni's  performance  in  it.  That  film  and  "The  Conquerors"  draw  the  largest  applause  of  recent  pictures.  And  rightly.   "Night  After  Night,"  "Call  Her  Savage,"  and  "If  I  Had  a  Million"  come  in  for  a  generous  share  of  praise,  too.  "Smilin'  Through"  re-  mains among  the  leaders  in  its  special  field.   Many  plaudits  came  for  Joan  Crawford  this  month,  and  closely  in  line  with  her  were  Shearer  and  Garbo.   An  interesting  note  from  an  Alaskan  reader  says,  "So  few  people  in  the  U.  S.  A.  realize  how  very  much  we  appreciate  the  movies  up  here  in  'Uncle  Sam's  Attic.'  "   Another  letter  from  Capetown,  South  Africa,  tells  us,  "There  are  at  least  five  different  types  of  pictures  being  shown  here  tonight."  Now  that's  diversity!  And  still  so  many  of  us  go  right  on  grumbling  about  the  sameness  of  our  film  fare.    THE  S5  LETTER   I  specialize  in  nervous  troubles.  When  I  ordered  a  woman  patient  to  throw  away  her  medicines  and  go  to  the  movies  instead,  she  and  her  friends  thought  I  was  crazy.   But  it  cured  her  because  it  got  her  interested  in  something  besides  her  ailments,  largely  im-  aginary.   I  have  done  this  whenever  I  have  had  a  balTling  nervous  case,  and  I  never  found  it  to  fail.   When  the  price  of  my  prescription  is  checked  with  the  usual  doctor's  bill,  it  will  be  seen  that  I'm  not  lining  my  own  pocket  exactly,  but  I  don't  mind,  for  I  get  results.  Grateful  hus-  bands have  told  me  that  I  saved  them  hun-  dreds of  dollars  with  my  simple  remedy.  Incidentally,  I'm  not  above  taking  a  dose  of  my  own  medicine.   Dr.  D.  W.  Davies,  Regina,  Canada   MUNI  STANDS  ALONE   Speaking  of  a  different  picture,  "I  Am  a  Fugitive  from  a  Chain  Gang,"  is  it— plus!  Paul  Muni  may  not  have  a  dimple  to  compare  with  Clark  Gable's,  or  a  winning  smile  such  as  Bob  Montgomery's,  but  when  it  comes  to  acting  he's  right  there.   Peggy  Lowe,  Tulsa,  Okla.   In  contemporary  American  life  motion  pictures  play  an  important  role.  "  I  Am  a  Fugitive  from  a  Chain  Gang"  is  a  shocking,  brutally  frank  reproach  to  a  civilization  which  permits  such  things.  There  should  be  more  pictures  of  this  type.   They  do  a  vital,  if  somewhat  intangible,  constructive  work  by  placing  before  the  public  illustrations  of  various  conditions  badly  in  need  of  correction.

A    UNIVERSAL   PICTURE    From  every  point  of  the  compass    [  CONTINUED  FEOM  PAGE  6  ]   "I  Am  a  Fugitive  from  a  Chain  Gang"  was  great!  Paul  Muni  is,  in  my  opinion,  a  truly  great  actor.  It  is  my  bet  that  he  will  travel  far  along  the  screen  road.  He  not  only  gave  a  good  performance — he  gave  a  powerful  dramatic  lecture  to  any  boys  or  men  who  may  have  had  the  slightest  thought  of  crime.  Helen  Mae  Lewis,  Warren,  Ohio   JOAN  CLIMBS  ALOFT   Hurrah  for  Joan  Crawford !  I  think  she  is  a  wonderful  actress.  Perhaps  Garbo  is  still  just  a  step  ahead  of  her.  But,  come  on  Joan,  you  can  make  that  one  step!   Virginia  R.  Martin,  Detroit,  Mich.   A  rumor  has  recently  reached  me  to  the  effect  that  Joan  Crawford  is  being  considered  for  the  role  of  Sonia  in  "The  Merry  Widow."  Joan  has  long  been  my  favorite.  Still,  I  am  not  convinced  that  she  is  the  one  for  that  role.  However,  she  is  often  surprising  (witness  her  Sadie  Thompson  in  "Rain"),  so  I'm  perfectly  willing  to  be  shown.   Mary  E.  Lauiser,  Philadelphia,  Penna.   What  has  happened  to  Joan  Crawford?  Where  is  the  fascinating  girl  of  "Our  Modern  Maidens"  and  "Our  Dancing  Daughters"?  I  am  afraid  she  is  losing  lots  of  admirers.   Thelma  C.  Sracii,  Los  Angeles,  Calif.   "THE  CONQUERORS"  CONQUER   For  those  who  believe  the  current  depression  is  unusual,  let  them  see  "The  Conquerors" —  Low  other  generations  have  gone  through  similar  conditions.  It  is  a  truly  fine  picture  and  one  the  whole  family  should  see.   The  cast  is  splendid.    Richard  Dix  and  Ann  Harding  give  extremely  convincing  perform-  ances.   The  delightful  comedy  touches  of  Edna  May  Oliver  and  Guy  Kibbee  are  excellent.  Beryl  Crowlll,  New  Orleans,  La.    The  event  Clara  Bow's  host  of  ad-  mirers have  long  been  waiting  for.  Her  comeback  picture,  "Call  Her  Savage,"  sends  them  into  raptures.  They  find  her  at  once  the  old  mad-  cap and  a  very  much  more  poised  Clara.  She  delights  both  boys  and  girls,  and  receives  huge  bouquets   u    George  Raft  proves  our  prediction  that  he  would  click  heavily  with  the  fair  sex  audiences  in  "Night  After  Night."  Mae  West  also  gets  a  big  hand  on  her  film  debut  for  her  riotous  comedy.  There  are  posies,  too,  for  Wynne  Gibson  and  Constance  Cummings  as  rivals  for  suave  Georgie    I  have  been  an  admirer  of  Richard  Dix  since  he  started  in  pictures.  In  "The  Conquerors"  he  has  left  nothing  for  the  Barrymores  to  brag  about.  His  aging  stunt  was  done  beautifully.  We  hope  he  will  still  be  thrilling  us  when  he  is  eighty-five.   Mary  Edwin  McLaughlin,  Rochester,  N.  Y.   GRAND  "NIGHT"  AND  STARS   I  have  just  seen  one  of  the  finest  pictures  in  a  long  time,  "Night  After  Night."  It's  "good  to  the  last  drop — of  the  curtain."  Con-  gratulations to  Mae  West  and  George  Raft!  And  I  do  hope  we  shall  see  them  playing  to-  gether again  real  soon.  Virginia  Spencer  Bertolotti,  Mobile,  Ala.   I  have  never  been  so  thrilled  by  a  picture  until  I  went  to  see  "Night  After  Night."  The  whole  cast  was  great;  Mae  West's  work  was  especially  good.  I  feel  George  Raft  could  play  Valentino  roles  successfully  and  revive  the  movie  spirit  of  old.   Orell  Bacirs,  Denver,  Colo.   PLEASE,  MISS  BROWNE!   The  world  knows  and  realizes  what  a  great  artist  and  genius  Greta  Garbo  is,  but  it  is  very  noticeable  that  practically  only  letters  from  those  who  knock  her  are  published  in  your  magazine.   Lorraine  Browne,  Toronto,  Canada   FROM  HITHER  AND  YON   This  little  missive  comes  to  you  from  the  "Land  of  the  Midnight  Sun."  We  are  thrilled  to  face  the  hard  rains  of  fall  or  wade  the  deep  snows  in  winter  to  see  a  picture.  Very  few  people  in  the  good  old  U.  S.  A.  realize  how  much  we  appreciate  movies  up  here  in  "Uncle  Sam's  Attic."   Leona  L.  Nelson,  Cordova,  Alaska    Give  us  more  pictures  like  "Grand  Hotel."  Garbo  ought  to  have  heard  the  ovation  she  received.  That  ought  to  make  her  return  from  Sweden.  Never  will  I  forget  Lionel  Barry-  more's  rendition.  Joan  Crawford  was  gorgeous.  Gerald  Haines  Neil  Cohen,   Calcutta,  India.   As  a  foreigner  living  in  China,  I  find  it  inter-  esting to  watch  the  reaction  of  the  Chinese  to  the  movies.  The  cinema  is  deservedly  popular  out  here — the  chief  source  of  entertainment.   The  Chinese  are  particularly  fond  of  "leg  shows" — spectacular  choruses  and  the  elabo-  rate settings  that  usually  accompany  revues.  They  also  appreciate  gangster  stories  but  dis-  play little  interest  in  domestic  tragedies  or  drawing  room  farces.   American  movies  are  by  far  the  most  popular  and  the  Chinese  show  unerring  good  judgment  in  their  choice.   Mrs.  W.  G.  Cumine,  Shanghai,  China   Born  in  China,  I  had  the  start  of  my  English  education  in  a  Canton  missionary  school.  When  I  came  to  Hawaii,  I  carried  my  embarras-  sing Oriental  accent  with  me.  It  seemed  im-  possible to  shed  what  seemed  part  of  my  heritage.  After  high  school,  my  English,  writ-  ing and  speaking,  still  had  the  Chinese  slant.   One  day  I  read  in  Photoplay,  which  I  have  been  following  for  the  last  twelve  years,  that  Paul  Lukas  did  not  speak  one  word  of  English  before  he  arrived  in  America.  I  read,  too,  of  Greta  Garbo's  Swedish  accent.  Yet  they  astonished  me  with  their  mastery  of  English.   I  have  made  it  a  point  to  attend  at  least  two  talkies  a  week,  paying  particular  attention  to  smooth  or  smart  dialogue.  Today  I  have  lost  my  Chinese  accent.  Over  the  telephone  people  say  they  can't  tell  me  from  an  American.   M.  Sing  Au,  Honolulu,  Hawaii   There  are  thousands  of  people  in  the  cities  of  South  Africa  who  never  have  the  oppor-  tunity of  seeing  famous  actors  and  actresses  in    come  movie-goers'  pros  and  cons    Maybe  we  should  call  them  Doctors  Laurel  and  Hardy — a  writer  says  they  cured  her  blues  over  a  broken  hand  and  lost  job.  Their  acting  as  self-constituted  fathers  of  little  Jacquie  Lyn  in  "Pack  Up  Your  Troubles"  also  pleases  those  who  like  comedy  tinged  with  a  bit  of  sentiment    the  flesh.  Do  you  think  that  worries  them?  No.  Why  should  it  when  we  can  see  and  hear  the  world's  best  on  the  talking  screen?   The  talkies  have  spoiled  my  appreciation  of  the  stage  out  here  because  it  compares  very  unfavorably  with  the  movies  we  see.  As  for  variety,  there  are  fifteen  movie  theaters  and  there  are  at  least  five  different  types  of  pictures  being  shown  here  tonight.   N.  Rumbelow,  Capetown,  South  Africa   A  GARBO  QUANDARY   Just  what  is  wrong  with  Greta  Garbo?  Or  is  it  me?  Every  time  I  see  one  of  her  pictures  I  swear  I'll  never  see  another.  Then  I  see  she  is  to  appear  in  a  new  picture;  I  get  all  thrilled  anew.    So  I  guess  I  must  like  her.   Maxwell  Hooper,  Asheville,  N.  C.   CLARA  AT  HER  BEST   Clara  Bow  is  back  again,  even  better  than  before.  In  "  Call  Her  Savage"  she  is  wonder-  ful. Just  full  of  the  old  Bow  pep  and  fire.  We  hope  she  will  always  be  on  the  top  rung  where  she  belongs.   Mr.  and  Mrs.  Rudy  F.  Bouteiller,   Louisville,  Ky.   Clara  Bow  has  come  back  to  her  loving  pub-  lic via  ''Call  Her  Savage,"  for  which  we  have  anxiously  waited  almost  two  years.  No  one  can  deny  Clara's  will  power  after  seeing  her  new  film.  The  lines  have  disappeared  from  her  youthful  face,  and  the  merry  twinkle  in  her  eyes  characterizes  the  Clara  of  old.  Her  figure  is  once  more  slender  and  graceful.  "Call  Her  Savage"  will  re-establish  Clara  Bow!   Miss  Catherine  L.  Pilsits,   Steelton,  Penna.   PLAY,  PLAYERS  PERFECT   "Smilin'  Through,"  ladies  and  gentlemen,  "Smilin'    Through"!     A   superb   production!    The  greatest  picture  Norma  Shearer  has  ever  made.  Leslie  Howard,  Fredric  March  and  O.  P.  Heggie  all  deserve  high  praise.   E.  L.  Bernhardt,  Tonawanda,  N.  Y.   RICH  CINEMA  FARE   "If  I  Had  a  Million" — there  is  a  picture! —  one  whose  entire  meaning  cannot  be  found  merely  on  the  surface.  The  directors  (and  there  were  seven  of  them)  have  given  us  a  truly  worthy  production,  leaving  out  all  superfluous  frills  and  unnecessary  details.  What  a  cast!  What  a  story!   Maurice  Drell,  Chicago,  111.   SEX  FILMS  GUIDE  YOUTH   I  am  sixteen.  Although  I  have  always  been  an  ardent  admirer  of  Janet  Gaynor  and  Charles  Farrell  and  enjoy  their  sweet  romances  best  of  all,  I  do  not  condemn  sex  pictures.  So  many  parents  try  to  prevent  their  children  from  see-  ing this  type  of  film.  They  do  not  realize  the  high  school  student  of  today  cannot  learn  any-  thing from  them  he  doesn't  already  know  and  that  it  wouldn't  do  him  any  harm  to  see  what  happens  to  those  who  fall  from  grace.   Do  you  see  anything  about  the  life  of  the  hero  or  heroine  of  sex  films  to  envy — to  make  you  wish  you  were  in  his  shoes?  Emphatically  no!  Aren't  they  always  shown  as  being  un-  happy and  disillusioned?  I  can  find  very  little  in  sex  pictures  that  would  put  wrong  ideas  in  young  people's  heads.  But  a  very  good  moral  can  be  found  in  them — that  it  doesn't  pay  to  lead  the  wrong  kind  of  life.  I'm  sure  there  must  be  many  who  agree  with  me  in  this.   Edward  F.,  Asbury  Park,  N.  J.   THE  BARRYMORE  ACE   We  are  proud  indeed  of  our  "royal  family"  and  this  is  a  tribute  to  the  great  genius  of  John  Barrymore,  so  clearly  demonstrated  in  "A  Bill  of    Divorcement."      His    acting    is    superb.    Katharine  Hepburn  was  so  brilliant  that  she  easily  took  second  honors.   Elizabeth  Avery,  Baltimore,  Md.   JEAN  COMES  THROUGH   Here's  to  Jean  Harlow,  one  of  the  bravest  girls  ever  to  face  a  camera!  Consider  her  won-  derful performance  in  "Red  Dust,"  when  the  eyes  of  the  world  were  upon  her,  mostly  in  dis-  approval !  She  will  go  on  to  bigger  and  better  parts.   I  think  I  like  Jean  best  with  red  hair.  Alice  E.  Johnson,  Bonaparte,  Iowa   FOR  THOSE  PANIC  PAINS   "  Prosperity"  is  a  fine  picture  and  certainly  prosperous  in  laughter.    Marie  and  Polly  help  to  brighten  our  gloomy  depression  mood.  Mrs.  H.  Schramm,  Wheeling,  W.  Va.   You're  too  good,  Lady  Dressier!  After  see-  ing "Prosperity"  I'm  convinced  that  your  public  will  never  let  you  go.  Whether  this  gossip  about  it  being  your  last  picture  is  the  truth  or  not,  you're  still  what  the  American  public  needs.  I  was  "blue  through  and  through"  when  I  went  to  see  "Prosperity,"  but  by  the  time  the  picture  was  over  I  was  hum-  ming a  tune.  How  you  do  put  it  over,  Marie!  Tom  O.  Mureitt,  Syracuse,  N.  Y.   A  PEST  DESTROYER   Aside  from  the  entertainment  value  of  the  now  perfect  photography  and  unerring  sound  reproduction  found  in  the  present-day  talkies,  there  is  an  additional  satisfaction — one  that  has  afforded  relief  to  theater-goers  in  that  it  has  silenced  the  inevitable  fellow  in  a  near-  by seat  who  persisted  in  reading  out  loud  or  murmuring  the  captions  that  appeared  in  the  silent  pictures.  The  sound  and  talking  are  now  where  they  belong — on  the  stage  and  not  in  the  audience.   R.  Bill  Williamson,  Lafayette,  La.    "The  Conquerors"  draws  raves  a-  plenty  for  its  stirring  romance  and  stars.  Ann  Harding  and  Richard  Dix.

TWENTY  THOUSAND  YEARS  IN  SING  SING   — First  National. — Rather  unconvincing  story  of  a  swaggering  tough's  prison  life  from  cell  through  death  house,  made  real  by  Spencer  Tracy's  acting  and  good  dialogue.  Bette  Davis,  Lyle  Talbot  and  Arthur  Byron  give  good  support.     (Jan.)    TWO    AGAINST    THE    WORLD— Warners.—   Weak  story,  but  Constance  Bennett  looks  pretty  and  does  good  work  in  a  shallow  role.

WESTWARD  PASSAGE  —  RKO-Pathe.  —  Ann  Harding,  ZaSu  Pitts  and  Irving  Pichel.  The  story  is  entertaining  enough  but  it  lacks  pep  and  punch.

I  say  to  myself,  "Lupe,  you  are  rich!"  Then  I  pinch  myself  to  be  sure  I  am  not  dreaming.   So  I  spend  money  like  water.  I  buy  the  most  expen-  sive dresses  and  hats  and  shoes  I  can  find.  If  a  dress  cost  hundreds  of  dollars  I  say,"Pouf!  That  is  nothing.  Send  me  home  two  of  them."   It  is  that  way  with  everything.  Bracelets,  handbags,  even,  and  stockings.  I  pay  them  what  they  ask  and  think  I  get  the  best  because  it  costs  most.   Then  one  day  a  man  calls  at  my  house.  He  is  from  Realsilk  and  he  wants  I  should  buy  stockings  from  him.   I  look  at  those  stockings.  They  are  very  beautiful.  I  ask  him  how  much  they  cost?   He  tells  me.   It  is  a  low  price  for  fine  stockings.   So  I  sniff  and  say,  "They  are  not  good  enough  for  Lupe,  they  do  not  cost  enough."   He  laughs.  Then  he  asks  me  if  they  are  beautiful  enough.  And  if  they  are  sheer  enough.  And  if  they  feel  luxurious  enough.  And  if  I  like  the  way  they  are  made.   And  I  have  to  say,  "Yes"  to  all  those  questions.  It  is  true,  too.   Then  he  laugh  again  and  say,  "Only  they  don't  cost  enough, eh?"   By  that  time  I  am  laughing  myself  and  saying  to  my-  self, "Lupe,  you  are  a  big  fool  with  your  money."   So  I  buy  some  of  those  Realsilk  stockings  which  I  like  very,  very  much.  And  that  is  how  I  cut  down  on  stockings,  and  on  all  the  other  things  I  have  been  spending  money  so  foolishly  for.   The  AtCiJl.

Three  in  a  row:  "Sherlock  Holmes,"  "Cavalcade"  and  next,  "Lives  of  a  Bengal  Lancer."  More  than  twelve  years  of  unvarying  success  in  American-made  pictures.

A  woman  of  the  world — of  the  world  of  culture — is  what  this  unusual  camera  study  depicts.

They  reported  amazing  results!  75%  fewer  runs  in  the  Lux-washed  stockings  than  in  the  stockings  labeled  "Cake  Soap."   Cake-soap  rubbing  destroys  the  elasticity  of  the  silk.  This  is  the  live,  stretchable  qual-  ity of  silk  which  makes  it  wear.  Lux  is  made  to  preserve  this  vital  elasticity.  That's  why  clever  girls  sure  their  stockings  by  washing  them  the  ^-minute  Lux  way  each  night.    "WE  GIRLS  were  awfully  keen  about  this  test,"  says  Miss  Sheerin,  "because  it  showed  us  how  many  stocking  runs  you  can  avoid  by  washing  your  stockings  the  right  way.  In  the  test,  we  each  took  a  pair,  labeled  one  stock-  ing Lux,  the  other,  cake  soap.    "EVERY   NIGHT  we  Luxed  one  stocking   rubbed  the  other  with  cake  soap.    There   were  7;>',<  fewer  runs  in  the  Lux  stockings!    "THAT'S  WHY  we  all  use  Lux  now -it  's  such  an  easy  way  to  cut  down  stocking  bills.  It  takes  only  2  minutes,  and  when  you  save  elasticity  with  Lux,  stockings  not  only  wear  l>etter  but  fit  better.  Keep  their  color  and  look  smoother,  too."    Mrs.  H.  IN.

I  was  neither.   De  Mille,  in  spite  of  his  rather  fixed  tendency  to  over-zealousness  in  striving  for  effects,  has,  neverthe-  less, usually  been  able  to  wrest  a  spiritual  significance  from  some  of  the  greater  themes  he  has  chosen.   Certainly  the  opportunity  should  not  have  been  lacking  in  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross."  But  I  left  the  theater  with  the  feeling  that  I  had  not  been  emotion-  ally or  spiritually  satisfied.   Perhaps  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross"  is  a  great  picture.  Perhaps  what  I  regard  as  serious  defects  may  be  ap-  plauded by  the  majority  of  motion  picture  theater-  goers who  see  it.  However,  I  believe  I  am  not  squeamish,  and  that  I  am  right  in  thinking  that  certain  sequences  in  the  production  had  much  better  have  been  omitted.    TAKE  that  dance  scene.  Because  of  its  peculiar  nature,  it  is  distinctly  offensive.  Some  years  ago  Nazimova  played  Salome  on  the  screen.  She  danced  the  terrible  dance  of  that  half-mad,  neurotic  woman  when  the  head  of  John  the  Baptist  was  brought  to  her  on  a  platter.  Xazimova's  dance  of  Salome  was  no  more  decadent  than  that  of  Joyzelle  in  the  palace  of  Marcus  Superbus.   Having  rather  astonished  his  audience  with  this  type  of  spectacle,  De  Mille,  one  might  think,  would  have  restrained  himself  from  going  on  to  another  offense.  He  lays  bare  with  brutal  frankness  the  horrible  orgies  of  the  Roman  Coliseum.  Lions  and  elephants  destroy  human  beings  and  men — yes  and  women,  too — mutilate  and  slay  with  gross  savageness.   Two  or  three  of  the  worst  episodes  have,  I  under-  stand, been  cut  from  the  film  since  I  saw  it,  but  Mr.  De  Mille  will  pardon  me  when  I  say  that  several  hundred  feet  of  additional  footage  could  well  have  been  eliminated.   Whether  such  spectacles  are  bad  taste  or  good  enter-  tainment is,  of  course,  for  the  individuals  that  make  up  picture  audiences  to  determine  for  themselves.    DE  MILLE  did  a  tremendously  fine  piece  of  work  when  he  created  "The  King  of  Kings,"  and  for  that  millions  of  persons  owe  him  a  debt  of  gratitude.    His  magic  touch  is  obviously  still  there  if  he  cares  to  exercise  it.   Probably  his  latest  picture  will  in  no  wise  mar  his  reputation  as  a  great  director,  but  I  most  sincerely  trust  he  will  not  make  a  similar  attempt.  Yet  oddly  enough,  even  the  very  defects  of  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross"  are  singularly  impressive.  No  one  who  has  once  seen  it  will  ever  be  able  to  forget  it.    AFTER  many  months  of  picture  inaction,  Mary  Pickford  proves  she  has  pondered  to  good  ad-  vantage. Taking  her  cue  from  costume  pictures  mixed  with  sentiment,  and  obtaining  for  her  lead  the  unmatched  Leslie  Howard,  her  forthcoming  produc-  tion, "Secrets,"  is  likely  to  usher  in  a  new  screen  era  for  her.   Mary  is  a  finished  actress.  Her  technique  has  always  been  illumined  by  an  understanding  intelli-  gence. She  has  a  gift  of  personal  charm,  exactly  suited  to  the  manners  and  customs  of  a  more  leisurely  and  polished  age.  In  such  an  atmosphere,  too,  Howard  is  well  nigh  perfect.  In  "Secrets"  each  will  have  a  sympathetic  role.   All  this  Mary  well  knows,  and  we  cannot  help  but  applaud  her  for  having  thus  met  the  problems  that  for  the  last  couple  of  years  have  thwarted  her.  Her  return  to  the  screen  should  be  a  personal  triumph.    AS  I  write  these  lines  Clara  Bow  has  stepped  into  a  world  unique  to  her  experience.  She  is  touring  Europe  under  the  tutelage  of  a  former  attache  of  an  embassy,  in  quest  of  culture.  The  expedition,  I  under-  stand, is  not  really  of  Clara's  choosing.  This  girl  of  appealing  personality,  of  which  the  curious  crowd  never  tires,  frankly  says  Raneho  Clarito  is  more  alluring.  Just  previous  to  sailing  with  husband  Rex  Bell  she  visited  the  New  York  zoo,  attired  in  blue  pajamas,  a  turtle  neck  sweater,  a  little  red  cap  and  a  magnificent  fur  coat.    I  FEAR  that  the  wonders  of  the  Louvre  and  St.  Peters  may  pall  upon  her.  Clara  is  too  emotionally  simple  and  direct  to  be  much  impressed  by  the  culture  of  Europe.  And  that,  to  my  mind,  is  the  real  reason  for  her  perennial  hold  upon  the  public.   25    There  are  no  complexities  in  her  acting.  Even  a  child  can  understand  it.  And  by  her  very  simplicity  she  achieves  near-greatness.    EVERYBODY  has  a  pet  belief  that  he  can  pick  them,  and  B.  P.  Schulberg  is  no  exception.    You  may  recall  that  he  picked  Clara  Bow.   He  believes  that  any  actor  or  actress  who  is  destined  to  become  a  star  makes  a  hit  in  the  first  picture,  no  matter  what  the  picture  or  how  small  the  part.  He  points  to  a  whole  list  of  stars  to  prove  it.   But  what  does  that  make  of  a  lot  of  other  stars?    JOAN  CRAWFORD  has  given  more  aid  to  aspiring  young  screen  heroes  than  any  other  actress  on  the  screen.  In  fact,  with  the  exception  of  Clark  Gable  in  "Possessed"  and  Robert  Montgomery  in  "Letty  Lynton,"  Joan  has  never  had  a  big  name  in  her  pictures.   Kent  Douglass  was  a  brand-new  comer  from  the  Pasadena  Community  Theater  when  he  supported  Joan  in  "Paid."  It  was  the  unknown  Lester  Vail  in  "Dance  Fools,  Dance"  and  now  comes  Franchot  Tone  in  her  new  one.   And  if  one  reads  the  signs  correctly,  Joan  is  growing  a  lot  irked  at  the  Leslie  Howards  and  Fredric  Marches  being  passed  about  elsewhere.   "How  about  a  big  name  for  me?"  Joan  asks.    AND  this,   we   are  assured,   is  Joe  E.   Brown's  favorite  mother-in-law  story.  Henry  was  sitting  in  the  living-room  concentrating  on  his  evening  paper.    He  failed  to  look  up  when  his  wife  rushed  in,  evidently  agitated.   "Henry!    Mother  says  she  wants  to  be  cremated."  Henry  finished  his  paragraph,  breathed  a  patient  sigh,  and  remarked,  "Well,  all  right.    Tell  her  to  get  her  things  on."    IF  a  Gold  Medal  were  offered  for  the  world's  most  enthusiastic  motion  picture  goer,  the  award  would  undoubtedly  fall  to  General  Juan  Vicente  Gomez,  president  of  Venezuela.  Every  day  for  three  hundred  and  forty  days  of  the  year  he  sees  a  motion  picture.  Practically  all  that  are  produced.   He  gets  a  big  laugh  out  of  Laurel  and  Hardy.  With  him,  however,  pictures  are  more  a  serious  matter  than  recreation.  He  finds  in  them  great  educational  value  and  knows  far  more  about  other  lands  and  their  customs  than  many  men  who  have  travelled  ex-  tensively.   EVEN  when  he  journeys  into  the  interior,  he  does  not  permit  himself  to  be  denied  his  one  great  interest.  On  one  occasion  he  had  sent  up  to  the  top  of  a  mountain  a  projection  machine  and  a  week's  quota  of  films.  At  the  age  of  seventy-five,  he  hus-  bands his  physical  strength  by  having  special  motion   26    pictures  made  of  the  progress  of  public  works  and  roads  throughout  Venezuela.   Cameramen  are  also  sent  to  his  several  ranches  for  pictorial  reports  as  to  just  how  they  are  being  oper-  ated. A  wise  man,  this  Gomez,  who  has  found  that  motion  pictures  are  really  of  the  great  educational  value  that  has  been  claimed  for  them.   HERE'S  an  elementary  lesson  in  "How  to  WTin  Over  the  Reluctant  Fan- Writer,"  as  demon-  strated by  Miss  Lupe  Velez.   Fan- writer  is  talking  with  publicity  exploiter,  when  Lupe  is  heard  approaching  in  the  distance — and  I  mean  heard.   "Dear  me,"  disapproves  the  P.  F.  W.  (Prim  Fan-  Writer),  "isn't  she  the  noisy  thing?  And  she  uses  so  much  make-up!"   At  this  moment,  Lupe  hurls  herself  into  view  and  spies  the  pair.  She  gallops  up  with  a  cute  little  prance  — and  straight  over  to  the  P.  F.  W.  whom  she  doesn't  happen  to  know,  but  a  little  thing  like  that  seldom  stops  Lupe.   "  I  AARLEEENG!"   exclaims   Lupe,   quite  undis-   .1 ' mayed,  smack  in  the  face  of  the  lady's  obviously   disapproving  look,  "you  are  suuch  a  pritty  girl — but  you  need  leep-rouge!  Here,  let  me  fix."  With  which  she  whips  out  a  lipstick  and  proceeds  to  decorate  the  undefiled  lips.  "Theeere,"  coos  Lupe,  "she  looks  precious  now.  She  look  irreseestible,  how  you  say.  Darleeeng,  use  always  the  leep-stick.  Here,  I  give  you  mine.    It  is  soo  pritty  on  you."   And  is  the  F.  W.  (we  can  now  drop  the  P.)  sold  on  Lupe?   Thinks  she's  the  most  charming,  refreshing,  ador-  able, natural,  talented — this  could  go  on  and  on— girl  in  pictures!    WHEN  sixty  million  people,  who  have  never  kissed  before,  begin  to  kiss  that's  really  more  significant  than  a  political  revolution,  and  motion  pictures  must  be  given  credit  for  this  astounding  sociological  change.  It  is  the  Japanese  who  are  dis-  covering what  they  have  been  missing  all  these  centuries.  American  love  scenes  on  the  screen  have  become  so  irresistible  that  the  Japanese  censors  have  removed  the  ban  from  them.   Progress?  Well,  perhaps  and  perhaps  not,  but  it  must  be  a  grand  thing  for  the  boys  and  girls.   A  CERTAIN  Hollywood  director  who  has  studied  the  movie  extra  and  knows  the  species  thor-  oughly, makes  this  estimate:   Take  any  twelve  girls  now  doing  extra  work  and  you  will  find  in  one  year's  time  that  six  of  them  will  be  married,  one  will  be  playing  bits,  one  will  have  left  the  struggle  for  other  work,  and  the  other  four  will  be  exactly  where  they  are  now — just  extras,  contented  with  little  work  and  less  food.

Sinister,  those  eyes,  even  here    "Clara  and  I  could  be  cast  away  on  a  desert  isle  all  alone,  and  have  a  good  time  every  minute"   Clara  is  the  Ideal  Wife    HONESTLY,  I  was  never  so  miserablv  unhappv  in  mv  life.  I  have  been  married  for  a  year  to  the  grandest  girl  in  the  world,  and  on  our  very  first  anniversary,  we  had  to  be  separated!   It  was  necessary  for  Clara  to  go  to  New  York  to  make  a  per-  sonal appearance  with  "Call  Her  Savage" — and  I  had  to  stay  in  Hollywood  to  finish  a  picture.   I  am  getting  through  these  lonely  two  weeks  of  our  first  separation  by  looking  forward  to  the  moment  when  we  will  be  together  again,  and  to  the  trip  to  Europe  after  that,  with  two  whole  months  all  to  ourselves.  We  are  going  over  on  the  great  Italian  liner,  the  "Rex."    That  was  Clara's  idea.   I  like  married  life.  I  like  being  married  to  Clara.  Fact  is,  I  can't  imagine  being  married  to  any  other  girl.  It  took  me  years  to  find  the  girl  I  wanted,  and  I  know  darn  well  I'd  never  find  another  like  her.   'We  went  together  two  years,  and  found  out  each  other's  faults  and  failures,  as  well  as  the  good  points.  She  decided  to  take  a  chance  on  me,  and  I  knew  I  wasn't  taking  any  chance  on  her!   Believe  me,  she's  all  gold,  that  girl.   Clara's  love  and  companionship  have  given  me  a  confidence  in  myself  and  my  work  that  I  never  hoped  to  have.  She  knows  exactly  what  an  actor  is  up  against  every  day,  because  she  is  in  the  same  profession.  In  my  opinion,  no  one  in  the  acting  profession  should  marry  out  of  it.    Better  to  stay  unmarried.   Situations  arise  in  the  moving  picture  busi-  ness that  anyone  on  the  outside  finds  prac-       D  D  tically  impossible    to  understand.      That's      ■*-'  J       -**■  "    where  Clara  is  marvelous,  an  embarrassing  situation  light  you  instantly.    There  isn't  a  spot  I  that  might  have  me    can  imagine,   in  the  worst   can  think    of,    that    Clara    wouldn't    comprehend   She  understands  this  peculiar  business  of  being  an    non-professional  wife — that's  something  else  again,  them — lovely,  well-meaning  girls  who  adore  their  —but  they  just  can't  seem  to  get  the  angle.    To  realize    actor.   Now  a  I've  seen  husbands-  the  unexplainable  things  that  can  happen  every  day.   TAKE  the  hours,  for  instance.  I  am  apt  to  get  home  for  din-  ner any  time  between  six  o'clock  and  midnight — sometimes  not  until  morning.  After  we  finish  work  on  the  set.  there  are  always  things  to  go  over  with  the  director,  people  to  see,  a  hundred  and  one  details  that  need  attention.  We  both  know  all  about  it.  So  if  I  arrive  home  at  nine  o'clock,  and  Clara  knows  we  finished  work  on  the  set  at  four,  she  is  not  curious  about  what  I  did  with  the  intervening  hours.   It  is  far  different  with  a  non-professional  wife.  She  may  be  married  to  the  most  devoted  actor  alive,  but  she  can't  help  being  exacting  and  curious  because  she  doesn't  know  what  goes  on.  She  feels  out  of  it,  neglected,  if  he  doesn't  tell  her  every  little  thing.  A  tired  man,  after  a  hard  day's  work  on  location  or  under  lights,  doesn't  feel  like  giving  a  recitation  or  a  lot  of  explanations.  I  honestly  think  this  is  the  foundation  of  much  trouble  between  couples  who  have  married  out  of  the  profession.     They  don't  speak  the  same  language.   Clara  knows  exactly  what  to  do  and  say  if  I   n        I  J      happen  to  get  home  all  burnt  up  because  some-   L      JJ  6  I  I      thing  went  [  please  turn  to  page  101  ]    "From  the  way  we  feel  now  it  looks  like  our  love  is  one  of  those  things  that  last  forever  and  ever"   Why  I   Love  Rex  Bell    I  THINK  it's  hard  to  say  why  one  person  loves  another  one,  don't  you?  I  might  tell  you  it's  .  .  .  what  do  you  call  that?  Oh,  yes  ...  a  kind  of  magnetism  between  Rex  and  me  .  .  .  maybe  that's  what  makes  me  love  him.  Or  maybe  it's  more  because  I  feel  right  .  .  .  sort  of  peaceful  and  safe  .  .  .  when  I'm  with  Rex  .  .  .  you  know  the  sort  of  feeling  I  mean.  Or  maybe  again  it's  the  kind  of  loyalty  we  have  for  each  other.  Rex  stuck  by  me  day  in  and  day  out  during  troubles  before  we  were  married.  We  saw  each  other  every  day  for  a  solid  year.  Well,  that  starts  a  kind  of  friend-  ship that's  going  to  last.  Rex  was  so  good  to  me,  so  kind  and  understanding  .  .  .  such  a  friend  .  .  .  I'll  never  forget  that  .  .  .  not  till  my  dying  day.   Oh,  but  don't  think  I  knew  the  minute  I  saw  him  that  I  was  in  love  with  him.  I  didn't  at  all.  I  thought  he  was  charming  .and  nice.  And  very  kind.  But  the  rest  all  came  afterwards.  It  grows  and  grows  and  every  day  I  love  him  a  little  more.  And  from  the  way  we  feel  now,  it  looks  like  one  of  those  things  that  are  going  to  last  .  .  .  forever  and  ever.  So  you  see,  I  can't  exactly  put  into  words  why  I  love  Rex.  But  I  do.  That's  all  I  know.   But  I  can  tell  you  little  things  he  does  .  .  .  and  it's  cer-  tainly the  little  things  that  count  for  a  woman,  don't  you  think  .  .  .  that  may  explain  what  I  mean.   When  I  was  working  so  hard  in  "Call  Her  Savage"  I  never  went  out.  I'd  come  home  so  dead  tired  I  could  hardly  move.  I'd  just  tumble  into  bed  at  eight-thirty  every  night,  and  that  was  that.  So  I'd  say  to  Rex:  "Darling,  why  don't  you  go  out  and  play  cards  with  the    every  night  doing  nothing!"  And  how  do  you  suppose  he'd  answer  me  every  time:   "Well,  Punkin,  (that's  what  he  calls  me)  if  you  want  to  know  the  truth,  I'd  rather  stay  here  quietly,  just  feeling  you  were  in  there  in  your  own  room  next  to  mine,  than  win  at  cards  for  ten  nights  running."   Now,  that's  Rex  for  you!   No,  you're  wrong,  there  isn't  any  boss  in  our  house.  Rex  always  says  to  me:  "Punkin,  I  want  you  to  do  anything  that  will  make  you  happy.  But  if  I  don't  like  it,  I'll  tell  you  so.  And  I'll  tell  you  why,  too."   And  he  does!    Believe  me,  he  does!   IT'S  funny,  too,  that  Rex  isn't  jealous.  Or  at  least,  he's  just  jealous  enough.  A  man  wouldn't  be  interesting  to  a  woman  if  he  weren't  a  little  bit  jealous,  don't  you  think?  But  he  isn't  jealous  like  other  men.   Maybe  that's  the  reason  we  don't  quarrel.  I  can't  re-  member one  quarrel  we've  had  since  we  married.  Not  about  anything  that  counts,  anyway.  Oh  sure,  we  have  our  dif-  ferences over  tiny  little  things.     You  know  how  it  is.   For  instance,  I  love  dogs.  And  I've  got  a  lot  of  them.  I  had  five  thoroughbred  Great  Danes  .  .  .  but  I've  given  three  of  those  away  now.  And  I  have  two  of  the  cutest  little  cocker  spaniels  you  ever  saw,  and  one  of  those  big,  red  hunting  dogs  .  .   .  you  know  the  kind  with  the  sad  eyes.   Well,  when  I  say  I  love  dogs,  I  mean  I  love  them  all  around  me.  everywhere,  in  and  out  of  every  room,    boys?

Director  Frank  Borzage,  pipe  in  hand,  stands  behind  the  pair,  between  the  cameras  and  the  microphone,  while  at  the  extreme  right  is  Mary's  personal  maid,  Erna  Jorgensen,  alert  for  instant  service,  as  is  her  hairdresser,  Mrs.    Photo  by  Stagg    Nina  Roberts,  standing,  next  to  the  microphone  boom  stand.   "Going  on  location"  is  practically  a  thing  of  the  past,  for  the  auto  horns  and  drone  of  air-  planes of  Southern  California  have  brought  Hollywood  to  it.   Many  a  sound  sequence  has  been  ruined  by    these  extraneous  noises.  On  no  studio  set  has  an  outdoor  scene  been  worked  out  better  than  the  one  shown  here.  The  house  is  surrounded  by  a  synthetic  garden  of  rare  beauty,  with  birch  trees  built  from  tissue  and  oak  trees  made  from  plaster  of  Paris.  Even  some  of  the  flowers  have  been  set  in  cement,  so  they  will  break  off    when  Mary  picks  them,  as  well-bred  flowers  should,  and  cause  neither  trouble  nor  delay.   And  when  all  is  said  and  done,  and  Mary  finally  makes  her  bow  to  us  from  the  screen,  the  financial  department,  after  scanning  the  production  costs,  will  be  sure  to  utter  a  heart-  felt "Thank  you !"   31    Who    Is    Hollywood's    Eighty  leading  ladies  can't  be  wrong — he's  champion  by  acclamation!  But  who  can  this  paragon  of  lovers  be?"    Here  he  is — and  practically  every  one  of  screendom's  loveliest  heroines  has  de-  manded him  for  her  wooer.    Who  is  he?    WHO  is  the  greatest  lover  of  the  screen?  The  greatest  lover  of  all  time — the  greatest  lover  the  screen  has  ever  known?  If  you  were  asked  that  question,  whom  would  you  name?  You  know  him,  of  course — but  who  is  he?   Three  guesses — or  three  dozen,  if  you  like.  And  a  dollar  to  a  doughnut  you're  wrong.   Would  you  say  Wally  Reid,  the  typical  young  American  lover  whom  countless  fans  still  remember  even  after  all  these  years?   Would  you  say  Rudy  Valentino,  the  un-  forgettable Latin  lover  whose  passionate  embraces  swept  millions  of  feminine  fancies  into  amorous  frenzy?   Would  you  say  Jack  Gilbert,  the  matinee  idol  lover  who  skewered  maidenly  hearts  like  beads  on  a  string  with  his  bold  glances?   Would  you  say  Dick  Barthelmess  or  Ramon  Novarro?  Francis  X.  Bushman,  or  Lou  Tellegen?  Conway  Tearle  or  Milton  Sills  or  Bert  Lytell  or  Thomas  Meighan?   You  might  say  any  of  these.  But  you'd  be  a  long  way  from  the  truth.   Would  your  choice  be  among  the  more  up-to-date  lovers,  the  reigning  heart-  breakers  of  today?  WTould  you  say,  for  in-  stance, Clark  Gable,  the  rough  guy  lover,  George  Raft,  the  gangster  lover,  Warner  Baxter,  the  romantic  lover,  James  Cagney,   32    Pulses  quicken  through-  out the  land  when  Chev-  alier reveals  his  ardent  love,  as  here  with  Jean-  ette  MacDonald  in  "Love  Me  Tonight."  Perhaps  that  makes  him  premier    Your  guess  may  be  the  cultured,  powerful  Richard  Dix.  Here  he  is  with  Gwili  Andre  in  "Roar  of  the  Dragon,"  to  help  you  decide  his  right   to   leadership    Greatest    S    creen    L    over    ?    By  Robert   Ryan    Miller    the  UD-and-at-'em  lover,  John  Barrymore,  the  imperious  lover,  Maurice  Chevalier,  the  naughty-naughty  lover,  Joel  McCrea,  the  nice  boy  lover,  Richard  Dix,  the  ceremonious,  eloquent  lover — ■  would  you  say  any  of  these?   Sorry,  but  you're  still  wrong.   The  screen's  greatest  lover  is  none  of  these.  None  of  them  can  even  remotely  compare  with  him  in  the  record  he  holds;  he  has  made  love  to  more  of  the  beautiful  women  of  the  screen  than  any  three  of  them  put  together.  He  hasheld  with  his  armsand  kissed  with  his  lips  more  gorgeous  creatures  than  any  man  on  earth.  Not  one  of  the  famous  love-makers  already  mentioned  can  even  chal-  lenge his  right  to  the  title  of  "The  Screen's  Greatest  Lover."   Listen:   In  the  past  fourteen  and  a  half  years  this  king  of  lovers  has  played  in  a  total  of  one  hundred  and  seventy-five  pictures.  During  that  time  he  has  made  love  to  over  eighty  different  screen  hero-  ines. Since  the  beginning  of  the  talking  pictures  alone,  in  the  past  four  years  only,  he  has  been  in  fifty-three  different  feature  films  and  "got  his  gal"  in  almost  every  one  of  them.   Valentino,  during  his  entire  screenlife,  played  in  only  fifteen  pictures — a  mere  bagatelle.   Wally  Reid  did  about  eight  a  year  for  some  five  years.   Novarro  and  Barthelmess  make  three  or  four  a  year — often  less.  Gable  and  Raft  and  Chevalier  are  mere  screen  youngsters,  who  really  can't  even  begin  to  compete.   Can  you  guess  yet  who  he  is?   No?  Well,  that  isn't  to  be  won-  dered at.  Only  one  person  has  picked  this  man  as  the  Perfect  lover,  and  you'd  expect  it  of  her.  Elinor  Glyn.  Nobody  else  would  even  suspect  it.  Least  of  all  the  screen's  greatest  lover  himself.   He  is  a  tall,  slim,  nice  blond  young  man.  He  is  suave  and  pol-  ished, and  makes  love  with  finesse  and  a  marvelous  voice.  He  has  been  married  for  nearly  fourteen  years — to  the  same  woman — and  has  a  daughter  twelve  years  of    Naturally,  Ramon  Novarro's  claims  must  be  weighed.  Wonder  what  Madge  Evans,  shown  with  him  in  "Huddle,"  thinks  of  it    Latin  ardor  may  have  won  George  Raft  first  place.  Con-  stance Cummings'  ideas,  after  this  scene  in  "Night  After  Night,"  might  help  us  guess    Do  you  suppose  that  Joan  Crawford,  shown  with  Clark  Gable  in  "Possessed,"  has  been  convinced  that  he  is  the  screen's  lover  beyond  compare?    John  Barrymore!  After  seeing  him  with  Garbo,  as  here  in  "Grand  Hotel,"  many  may  say,  "no  doubt  about  it."  Still,  that's'  opinion,  and  we're  talking  of  settled  fact    age.  He  has  been  leading  man  for  almost  every  important  woman  star  who  has  graced  the  silver  sheet  in  the  last  generation.  He  began  lovemaking  with  Alice  Brady,  when  she  was  the  reigning  queen.  He  continued  with  Bessie  Love,  Norma  Talmadge,  Pauline  Frederick,  Lillian  Gish,  Renee  Adoree,  Joan  Crawford,  Norma  Shearer,  Lupe  Velez,  and  on  down  the  line.  His  list  of  screen  "dates"  looks  like  the  bluebook  of  film-  dom;  it  includes  even  fiery  Pola  Negri  and  the  great  Garbo  herself.  Eighty  of  them — what  other  mor-  tal was  ever  so  fortunate?  What  comparisons  he  could  make!  Nor  is  that  all.  The  oddities  about  him  match  his  record  for  range  of  experience.   CAN  you  imagine  the  screen's  greatest  lover  coming,  not  from  the  fabled  Sahara  or  the  romantic  Argentine,  but  from  Keokuk,  Iowa?  Well,  he  did.  And  can  you  imagine  such  a  heartbreaker  be-  ing a  pillar  of  the  church?  Well,  he  is.  And  can  you  imagine  his  being  Hollywood's  dignified,  offi-  cial representative  at  functions  great  and  sundry?  His  name  never  mixed  up  in  any  scandal  at  all?   Now  you  do  know  him.  Conrad  Nagel,  to  be  sure.   Conrad  Nagel  is  unquestionably  the  greatest  lover  of  the  screen.  All  the  statistics  prove  it — and  figures,  unlike  kisses,  do  not  He.    Oh,  that  compelling  yank  on  the  scarf — no,  it's  a  towel!  Perhaps  Loretta  Young,  after  this  treat-  ment in  "Taxi,"  puts  Jimmy  Cagney's  rough  manner    in    first     place    No  other  picture  actor  can  even  begin  to  approach  his  record  of  romances,  no  other  screen  lover  can  point  with  pride  to  even  half  as  many  celluloid  conquests.  Elinor  Glyn  wept  the  first  day  he  came  on  the  set  to  play  in  '"Three  Weeks";  when  he  had  finished  she  sent  him  her  por-  trait thus  inscribed:   "To  Conrad  Nagel — the  Per-  fect Paul  and  the  greatest  lover  of  the  screen."    YOU'RE  laughing  at  the  thought  of  Conrad  as  the  great  lover?  Well,  so  did  he  when  the  matter  was  mentioned  to  him.   "  Why,  I'm  not  a  great  lover,"  he  protested,  "  that's  one  thing  nobody  can  ever  pin  on  to  me."   But  when  he  was  asked  to  name  any  feminine  star  to  whom  he  had  not  made  love  at  some  time  or  another — well,  he  had  to  stop  laughing  and  think.   "Yes,"  he  said  after  a  long  thought-conference  with  himself,  "  there  is  one.  I  never  played  opposite  Mary  Pickford  in  any  of  her  pictures."   Too  bad.     What  Mary  has  missed!   Conrad  began  his  career  on  the  stage  in  New  York,  playing  opposite  Dorothy  Bernard  in  "Little  Women,"  and  making  love,  of  course.  But  it  was  Alice  Brady,  who  in  1918,  convinced  him  that  his  real  future  lay  in  the  then  ridiculed  moving  pic-  tures.    The  two  made  "Red  Head"  together.   "  I  remember  one  incident  with  Alice  particularly,"  Conrad  reminisced.  "We  were  doing  a  wedding  scene,  and,  anxious  to  make  it  authentic,  the  director  had  us  go  through  the  entire  ceremony.  The  studio  was  in  New  Jersey,  where  no  marriage  license  was  necessary,  and  after  the  scene  was  finished  some-  body told  us  that  we  were  really  legally  married  because  we  had  gone  through  the  ceremony  in  the  presence  of  witnesses."   That's  about  the  best  he  can  do  by  way  of  a  hidden  past.   34    Warner  Baxter  to  the  judging  stand — either  as  here  with  Janet  Gaynor  in  "Daddy  Long  Legs,"  or  any  picture  you  prefer !  How  about  him  as  the  hero   for  whom  Hollywood's  heroines  clamor?    We  must  think  of  Rich-  ard Barthelmess  when  romantic  prowess  is  in  question.  Here  he  is  with  Marian  Marsh  in  "Alias  the  Doctor."  Is  he  your  choice   as    champion?    Shortly  afterwards  Conrad  married  the  present  Mrs.  Nagel,  and  they  came  to  California  to  follow  his  movie  hunch.  His  career  in  Hollywood  began  with  "The  Fighting  Chance,"  in  which  he  played  with  Anna  Q.  Nilsson.  In  that  picture  they  invented  the  "submarine  kiss"  — he  making  ardent  love  to  Anna  submerged  in  a  swimming  pool.  Then  came  Sylvia  Breamer,  Lois  Wilson,  Elsie  Ferguson,  Ruth  Chatterton  of  the  silent  screen,  Dorothy  Dalton,  and  Mildred  Harris.   "I  played  with  both  Dorothy  and  Mildred  in  'Fool's  Para-  dise,' "  the  great  Lover  recol-  lected, "and  C.  B.  De  Mille,  the  director,  began  it  in  his  usual  way  with  a  general  story  con-  ference of  all  the  cast  and  crew.  Poor  Mildred  was  late  that  morning — an  unpardonable  sin;  and  I'll  never  forget  Mr.  De  Mille's  classic  speech  complimenting  her  upon  being  the  first  of  a  long  line  of  famous  women  to  keep  him  waiting."   Next,  Conrad  played  opposite  Gloria  Swanson  in  "The  Im-  possible Mrs.  Bellew"  and  then,  in  rapid  succession,  made  love  to  Leatrice  Joy,  whom  Cecil  B.  De  Mille  nagged  and  scolded  into  stardom,  Agnes  Ayres,  May  McAvoy,  Edith  Roberts,  and  Bebe  Daniels.   IT  was  with  Bebe  that  Conrad  got  his  first — and  only — taste  of  Hollywood  scandal.  The  company,  making  "  Nice  People,"  were  working  on  a  little  deserted  road  in  Topanga  Canyon,  and  some  passing  motorists  saw  Bebe  and  Conrad  sitting  in  one  of  the  closed  studio  cars  between  scenes.  They  did  not  see  the  rest  of  the  company,  though,  and  the  next  day  the  "romance"  was  broadcast  from  the  housetops.   "Thank  Heaven,  though,"  Conrad  remarked,  "Mrs.  Nagel  paid  no  attention  to  Hollywood  rumors."   If  she  had  paid  any  attention    [  please  turn  to  page  122  ]    Only  Muni   Can  Do  IT    ??    'The  Fugitive'  is  the  envy  of  every  actor  in  Hollywood  and  on  Broadway,  too   By  Jeanne   North    PAUL  MUNI  has  the  most  perfect  contract  of  any  actor  in  Hollywood.  We  hear  of  Connie  Bennett's  $30,000  per  week  contract  (a  gross  exaggeration  since  she  only  gets  this  by  the  picture!)  and  Ruth  Chatterton's  $750,000  one.  (Not  an  exaggeration.)  And  we  count  them  as  the  most  fortunate  contract-holders.   But  that  is  not  the  way  other  actors  look  at  it.   Spencer  Tracy  said  to  me,  recently,  "Have  you  ever  in-  vestigated Paul  Muni's  contract?  The  lucky  dog.  He's  got  the  drop  on  Hollywood  as  no  one  else  in  the  business."   "But  Muni  is  in  New  York  doing  a  play!"   "Certainly.  That's  how  he  has  the  drop.  He  does  a  play  in  New  York  and  then  a  picture  in  Hollywood.  He  demands  his  own  price  out  here.    He  does  only  the  picture  he  chooses — "   Spencer's  description  sounded  like  an  actor's  paradise.  I  was  going  .to  New  York  and  decided  to  investigate  this  Utopian  arrangement.   I  did.  Spencer  was  right.  Paul  Muni  ("Scarface,"  "A  Fugitive  from  a  Chain  Gang,"  etc.)  is  the  envy  not  only  of  every  actor  in  Hollywood  but  on  Broadway.   He  is  under  contract  to  Warner  Bros.  That  is  the  way  he  terms  it.  I  should  say  that  Warners  are  under  contract  to  him!   If  Warners  produce  a  script  which  he  approves,  he  goes  to  the  Coast  to  make  it — when  his  New  York  play  has  finished  its  run.  While  at  the  Coast — he  chooses  his  next  Broadway  production.  He  recently  finished  a  run  of  "Counsellor-At-  Law"  on  Broadway.   But  he  didn't  get  this  drop  on  Hollywood  without  suffer-  ing and  experience.  His  early  Hollywood  adventures  taught  him  that  fearlessness,  and  fearlessness  only,  can  secure  for  a  man  complete  independence.  It's  a  startlingly  unusual  story  only  in  its  consequences.  Almost  every  actor  out  there  has  been  through  the  same  disheartening  disappointments.   It  was  in  1928 — those  early,  bewildering  days  of  the  talkies.  Hollywood  producers  reached  Broadway  and  exclaimed,  in  unison,  "Ah,  here  is  the  end.  These  actors  and  actresses  are  the  solution.    They  can  talk."   So  they  carried  them  to  Hollywood  in  hordes.  Anyone  on  the  stage  was  whisked  into  any  compartment  headed  west-  ward.   Among  them — Paul  Muni.   "They  had  no  vehicles  for  us,"  Paul  Muni  laughed  at  the  memory.  "They  popped  poor  fellows,  like  myself,  into  any-  thing and  everything.     Plays  that  they  tried  to  trick  up.   "I  was  out  there  six  months  before  they  gave  me  something  to  do.  I  drew  my  salary  every  week  and  did  no  work.  I  couldn't  understand!  Then  'The  Valiant.'  It  was  to  be  a  big  production  and  then,  right  in  the  middle,  they  cut  the  cost.  They  had  discovered  Broadway  names  didn't  mean  a  thing.

It  seems  Jean  has  a  good  old  healthy  schoolgirl  crush  on  Jay  Whidden,  the  orchestra  leader  and  everyone  is  glad  Jean  has  taken  a  new  interest  in  life,  at  least.   In  fact,  Jean  is  just  that  interested  she  wants  Jay  for  her  next  leading  man.  And  the  idea  has  pleased  the  young  man  so  much,  he's  even  had  his  nose  remodeled.  Just  in  case,  you  know.   So  don't  be  surprised.   \\7"E  hereby  nominate  Katharine  Hepburn  *^  for  the  official  title  of  Hollywood  What-  A-Girl.  She  even  has  her  own  publicity  de-  partment stopped,  and  that  takes  some  stopping.   Up  until  a  week  ago,  they  didn't  even  have  a  stock  biography  of  this  baffling  lady.   She  doesn't  want  to  tell,  she  wants  to  let  us  speculate.     Pinch-hitting  for  Garbo?    TT  was  "No,  No,  Janet,"  when  piquant  Gay-  ■^nor  took  it  upon  herself  to  blast  the  fan-made  Gaynor-Farrell  romance.  Despite  all,  in  1929  she  upped  and  married  a  certain  young  lawyer,  Lydell  Peck.   It  was  a  much  firmer  "No,  No,  Janet"  from  studio  executives  which  prevented  her  from  changing  herself  into  a  more  temperamental  Crawfordy-Shearer-Bennetty  screen  lady.  For  was  she  not — in  those  rosy,  sentimental  roles —  the  people's  choice?   But,  at  least,  Janet,  no  one  dared  attempt  to  stop  the  "temperamental  differences"  which,  you  tell  us,  have  called  a  halt  to  your  marriage  with  Lydell  Peck,  now  a  Fox  supervisor.   Yet,  now  that  Charlie  Farrell  has  gone  from  the  Fox  lot  for  ever  and  aye  ...  So  what?   T  OUISE  CLOSSER  HALE  has  re-  "^"'cently  learned  to  drive  a  car,  but  she  is  taking  no  chances.  It's  a  sedan  and  she  keeps  the  doors  locked.  Yes,  when  she's  inside,  also.   Arriving  at  M-G-M  in  make-up  for  "The  Son-Daughter,"  Mrs.  Hale  discovered  the  lock  had  sprung  and  there  she  was.   Warm  day,  too.   It  took  two  lock-smiths  to  release  the  lady,  and  by  that  time  all  the  make-up  was  down  her  neck.    International    She    "She  didn't  say  yes — and  she  didn't  say  no.  wanted  to  stay"  .  .  .  and  she  did.  They  were  carried  to  Europe  "by  accident",  you'll  recall.  From  the  looks  of  that  table  we  agree  with  goldilocks  Marilyn  Miller  and  raven-haired  Don  Alvarado  that  the  stowaway  racket  is  a  mighty  pleasant  one    ""THE  most  amazing  transformation  of  this  ■*■  last  year  is  that  of  Joan  Crawford.  A  year  ago  Joan  went  in  for  little  sew-at-home  dress-  makers and  had  every  dress  copied  in  a  half  dozen  colors.   They  were  simple  little  things  with  that  home-made  look.   But  the  home-made  things  have  become  a  part  of  the  Crawford  past  as  Joan  steps  out  in  the  latest  Schiaparelli  model  or  Hattie  Carne-  gie knockout.   Y\  THEN  Marilyn  Miller  "and  party"  failed  ^^  to  attend  to  that  little  detail  of  leaving  the  Bremen  at  New  York  when  the  "ail-  ashore"  signal  was  given  not  so  many  moons  ago — it  was  just  loo  good  to  be  true!   "Nuts,"  was  the  remark  of  the  Broadway  "know-it-alls"  when  they  read  the  stowaway  story.   But,  when  Marilyn  and  Don  Alvarado,  '"that  big,  bold  answer  to  a  maiden's  prayer"  (that's  what  his  agent  calls  him),  found  them-  selves in  mid-ocean,  minus  clothes,  funds  and  passports,  and  plus  twin  headaches — it  was  just  too  true  to  be  good!   CO  was  the  fact  that  Marilyn  "and  party"  weren't  permitted  to  land  at  Cherbourg,  when  Marilyn  suddenly  made  up  her  mind  that  she  must  visit  the  bedside  of  Jack  Pickford,  her  former  husband,  who  was  lying  ill  in  Paris  at  the  time.   The  petite  Miss  Miller  denies  all  reports  that  she  was  married  at  sea.  Says  she  and  Don  Alvarado  are  engaged,  but  that's  as  far  as  the  romance  has  proceeded.    Well,  it  may  not  be  Don  Alvarado  at  all  by  the  time  you  read  this.   TT'S  a  funny  story  they  are  telling   on  Lew  Cody  and  Buster  Keaton.   At  a  grand  party  one  evening,  at  which  many  people  were  present,  they  became  more  and  more  down-  cast at  the  apparent  stinginess  of  the  host.   It  seemed  to  them  refreshments  were  being  served  in  eye-droppers  and  very  infrequently,  at  that.   Getting  more  and  more  burnt  at  such  a  lack  of  hospitality,  they  put  on  their  hats  and  stalked  right  out  of —  Keaton's  own  house.   T  OOKS  as  if  our  Jack  Gilbert  has  the  right  girl  at  last.    He  had  to  search  around  a  bit —  but  then,  so  do  prospectors.   The  gay  and  merry  Jack  of  old  with  the  I-  dare-you  smile  has  returned,  and  welcome  home,  big  boy.   Virginia  takes  him  places  and  with  her  quiet  smiling  approval,  brings  out  the  best  in  him  as  no  one  else  has  ever  done.  Which  reminds  old  Cal  of  his  original  theory  that  the  smartest  women  are  the  ones  who  know  when  not  to  talk.   V\  70RD  comes  breezing  into  town  that  Garbo  (you  remember  Garbo?)  has  grown — er — quite  plump.  Returned  travel-  ers to  Hollywood  carry  tales  of  Greta's  wholesale  consumption  of  the  good  old  Swe-  dish pastries,  long  denied,  and  now  what?

So  it  looks  like  another  long,  hard  siege  of  denial  and  exercise  for  Greta  who  does  so  love  her  Swedish  coffee  cake.   T_TOLLYWOOD  has  a  new  mystery,  more  puzzling,  more  interesting,  more  intri-  guing, more  just  everything  than  any  it  has  ever  had.   One  newspaper  reported  that  Charlie  Chap-  lin was  arrested  on  a  certain  Sunday  night  in  Ventura  for  driving  faster  than  the  law  allowed.   Paulette  Goddard  was  riding  with  him,  the  news  item  said.   Another  newspaper  printed  a  story  that  Paulette  Goddard  was  given  a  speed  tag  on  the  same  Sunday  night  in  Ventura  by  the  same  motorcycle  officer  and  cited  to  appear  before  the  same  judge.   Charlie  Chaplin  was  riding  with  Miss  God-  dard, the  news  item  said.  Hollywood  no  longer  cares  who  hit  Lew  Brice,  nor  which  one  of  the  four  Marx  Brothers  is  the  maddest,  nor  what  became  of  all  the  song  writers.   Hollywood  wants  to  know  who  was  driving  that  car!

A  big,  mellow  voice  of  peculiar  sweetness,  coming  out  of  the  old  family  loud-speaker  and  filling  the  warm,  lamp-lit  living  room  with  luscious  melody.  But  Kate  Smith  is  more  than  that — much  more.     She  has,  for  five  years,  been  a  big  figure  on  the  stage  and  on  the  air.  Now  she  is  bound  to  be  a  big  figure  in  talking  pictures — all  215  jolly  pounds  of  her!   For  the  past  year  or  two  Kate's  rich  organ-tones  have  been  trying  to  push  the  moon  over  the  mountain  by  way  of  the  microphone.  She  is  one  of  radio's  mightiest  names  and  talents.  She  has  hurled  her  enormous  bulk  about  the  stages  of  Broadway,  to  great  acclaim.   Now  big  Kate  has  succeeded  at  last  in  her  major  endeavor.  She  has  boosted  the  moon  over  the  whole  Sierra  Nevada  range  of  mountains  and  plump  into  Hollywood.  There,  bathed  in  floodlight,  she  spreads  sweetness  across  the  Paramount  lot.  Soon  her  first  starring  talkie,  "Hello  Everybody,"  will  stir  you.  You  probably  heard  her  sing  in  "The  Big  Broadcast."   40    The  romantic  story  of  Kate  Smith,  who  now  adds,  to  stage  and  radio  triumphs,  a  career  in  the  talkies    Yes — probably  Kate  Smith  is  only  a  big  sweet  voice  to  you.  To  me,  however,  she  is  an  old  and  dear  pal.    A  girl-woman  in  her  early  twenties,  a  gay  and  gallant  spirit,  one  of  the  most  winning  figures  before  the  public's  eyes  and  ears.   You  see,  I've  known  Katie  since  she  was  knee-high  to  a  hippo.    When  I  first  beheld  her,  she  was  a  mere  chit  of  a  girl  in  her  'teens — she  couldn't  have  weighed  more  than  a  meager  180  when  first  she  burst  upon  my  startled  sight.     All  these  busy   years   we've   been   friends.      Separation   has   made   no  changes.    I've  watched  her  rise  with  joyous  affection.  And  I  think  you  should  know  her  truly  dramatic  story.  One   day   my   newspaper   phone,    down   in   Washington,  jingled.     The  caller  was  Nelson  B.  Bell,  then  a  potent  press-agent  and  now  a  picture  critic.     He  must  al-  ways rank  as  the  first  of  Kate's  many  "discoverers."  "Len,"  said  Nels,  "I  want  you  to  come  down  and  see  a  girl  I've  found  and  am  getting  a  job.  She's  a  real  find."   I  was  and  am  skeptical  of  all  "discoveries."  But  I  ambled  down.   And  there,  filling  Bell's  office,  was  the  girl.  After  the  first  shock  at  her  bulk,  I  no  longer  noticed  it.  For  her  face  was  truly  beautiful —  regular  features,  lovely  eyes  and  a  peachy-creamy  skin  anvone  would  love  to  touch.   "This,"  said  Mr.   Bell,   "is  Kate  Smith."   T  HEARD  her  sing,  in  a  little  -*•  rehearsal  hall,  and  I  was  thrilled.  That  rich,  sweet  voice  caught  hold  of  me,  did  some-  thing to  me.  It  was  made  to  order  for  the  ballads  of  our  era.  "Who  for  gosh  sakes,"  I  asked,  "taught  you  to  sing  like  that?"   "Nobody,"    said    Kate.    "I  just  learned."   That    glorious    voice,    like  little  Topsy,  just  grew.     How  she  sang — and  how  she  sings!  She    was    and    is    entirely    a  "natural"    singer.       She    has  none    of    the    petty    monkey-  tricks  of  the  prima  donna.    If  there  is  such  a  thing  as  a  human  song-bird,  it's  Katie.     She  warbles  as  easily,  naturally  and  unaffectedly  as  the  rest  of  us  breathe.   She  opens  her  mouth,  and  out  comes  song.  And  that  sweet  and  easy  voice  has  made  her  rich  and  famous.   And  so  it  was  my  pleasure  to  give  Kate  Smith  one  of  the  very  first  good  newspaper  notices  of  her  career.  'Member  that  piece,  Kate?   In  those  early  days  Big  Girl  took  her  jobs  where  she  found  them.  They  were  few  and  feeble  enough.  She'd  let  off  a  ballad  or  two  and  then  crash  into  an  astounding  "Charleston"  routine,  for  it  was  the  day  of  that  goofy  craze.  The  Charleston  always  brought  down  the  house,  not  to  mention  the  plaster  and  most  of  the  lighting  fixtures.   She  played  in  Washington  movie  theaters  for  a  few  paltry  pence.  I  used  to  visit  obscure  road-houses  around  the  capital  city  with  my  lady  of  the  moment.   And  there  would  be  Kate,  warbling  and  hoofing  for  coffee  and  cakes.    Sometimes  for  just  cakes.

Charlie  goes  on  His  Own    By   Re gin  aid  Taviner    SEVEN  years  ago  a  couple  of  kids  started  up  the  cinema  ladder  to  fame.  Together,  they  climbed  swiftly  to  the  top.  America  took  them  to  its  heart.  The  whole  world  embraced  them.  They  were  Diane  and  Chico,  who  ar-  rived together  in  "  7th  Heaven."   The  perfect  screen  romance  was  born  between  wistful,  wee  Janet  Gaynor  and  boyish,  bold-eyed  Charlie  Farrell.  Almost  unheard  of  before,  they  triumphed  together.  They  triumphed  equally.  They  were  a  perfect  pair — so  well  matched  that  the  millions  of  followers,  whom  they  won  overnight  and  have  kept  ever  since,  hoped  for  a  real-life  romance  as  well.   They  were  the  screen's  ideal  young  sweethearts.  A  welcome,  refreshing  relief  from  the  old,  hectic  movie-lovers.  Love's  simple,  unsophisticated  young  dream,  personified.  Clean.  Sin-  cere. A  boy  and  a  girl,  more  appealing  than  sex.  You  believed  them.  You  sympathized  with  them.  You  loved  through  them,  with  them.   When  you  thought  of  one  you  thought  of  the  other.     Gay-  nor, Farrell;  Janet,  Charlie.     They  seemed  to  belong  to  each  other,  like  moonlight  and  honeysuckle  or  bluebells  and  Scot-  land.   And  both  of  'em  belonged  to  you —  together.   Now  Charlie  has  gone  on  his  own.  He  has  left  Janet,  left  the  Fox  studio  alto-  gether. His  contract  has  been  torn  up  at  his  own  request.  The  kids  whom  you  saw  come  together,  grow  up  together,  aren't  to-  gether any  more — the  sweethearts  have  gotten  a  screen  divorce.  It  isn't  Janet's  fault.    It  isn't  Charlie's  fault.    It  isn't  any-    Chico  had  to  leave  his  Diane  at  last  because  he  felt  his  future  was  in  peril    One  of  the  last  scenes  Janet  and  Charlie  ever  made  together.  This  is  from  "Tess  of  the  Storm  Country."  They  have  co-starred  in  ten   smash  hits    one's  fault.  But  everybody's  all  broken  up  about  it.  It's  almost  as  though  you  had  made  the  match  yourself,  watched  it  bloom  for  seven  years,  and  then  saw  it  go  up  in  smoke.   Not  that  it  all  came  about  in  a  minute.  Charlie  didn't  get  mad  and  impulsively  pack  his  make-up  case.  He  still  adores  working  with  Janet,  still  hopes  for  another  "7th  Heaven."  And  thereby  rests  a  story.   OUT  at  his  comfortable  unmovie-like  Beverly  Hills  house,  over  an  eleven  o'clock  breakfast,  Charlie  explained  it  all.  Between  necessary  occupation  with  baked  apples,  little  pig  saus-  ages, coffee  and  fried  eggs — it  hasn't  affected  his  appetite  at  all — he  told  exactly  how  he  felt.  Just  then  he  felt  grand,  for  he  had  just  come  back  from  a  week's  cruise  on  his  little  yawl  and  had  slept  twelve  hours;  sailing,  he  says,  makes  you  both  hungry  and  sleepy.   Before  he  went  sailing  he  bade  Janet  goodbye.    He  took   leave  of  the  studio.    He  told  the  studio  heads  first,  in  Winnie   Sheehan's  office,  where  a  lot  of  big  shots  were  gathered  to  see   if  he  didn't  want  to  change  his  mind.    He  didn't.    He  had  been   too  long  making  it  up.   Then  he  went  to  the  set  where  Janet  is  working  on  a  picture  with  Lew  Ayres,  bor-  rowed from  Universal.  There  was  quite  a  lump  in  Janet's  throat  when  she  saw  Charlie.   "So  you're  going,"  she  said  in  that  little  voice  of  hers.  "You're  going  on  your  own  —  and    that   means   I'm   on  my  own   now,  tOO.  "  [  PLEASE  TURN  TO  PAGE  90  ]    45    YX/"OULD  you  take  him  for  a  master  of  laughs?  *  *  Or  a  chap  who  totes  stenographers  around  the  office  when  they  call  him  Buster?  Well,  the  serious  visage  above  is  the  foundation  upon  which  Charles  Laughton  builds  his  power-  ful studies,  comic  and  otherwise.  At  the  right,  is  the  "home  body"  side,  with  Mrs.  Laughton.  The   opposite    page    tells   of    his   whimsies    46    uuch  A  1\    And  he's  just  as  roguish  in  the  studio  as  he  often  is  on  the  screen   By  Ba rbara  Barry    AN  English  accent,  mind  you,  on  that  old  tyrant,  Nero!  It's  too  funny.  The  audi-  ence, attending  the  preview  of  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross,"  howled  with  laughter.  Rolled  right  out  into  the  aisles,  they  did.  Wailed  hysterically  on  one  another's  shoulders.  Blase  Hollywood  simply  went  wild.  And  with  just  cause.   Charles  Laughton,  our  pop-  ular English  acquisition,  has  done  a  refreshingly  original  job  in  characterizing  the  witless  emperor,  who  fiddled  on  three  strings  while  naughty  Rome  stewed  in  its  own  juice.  And  how  he  loved  doing  it!   You  saw  him  man-handle  Tallulah  Bankhead,  smash  up  a  perfectly  good  submarine,  and  drown  himself,  with  blood-  curdling sound  effects,  in  "Devil  and  the  Deep."  You  saw  him  murder  an  innocent  bystander  and  lay  him  among  the  sweet  peas  of  his  own  back  yard,  in  "  Payment  Deferred. "   And  all  the  time — even  while  he  sneered  and  slaughtered —  this  Laughton  chap  had  a  wistful  eye  on  the  grinning  mask  of  Comedy.  Yearning  for  a  chance  to  make  folks  laugh.  If  mur-  der must  be  done,  he  argued,  why  couldn't  it  be  accomplished  by  allowing  the  victims  to  laugh  themselves  to  death?  There  you  are.  A  nice  clean  murder,  you  know.  Splendid!  as  Charlie  himself  would  put  it.   WORKING  as  desk  clerk  at  the  Claridge  Hotel,  in  London,  Laughton  had  an  excellent  opportunity  to  study  the  various  types  of  humanity  that  passed  in  review  before  his  discerning  eye.   He  knew  them  all.  Peered  beneath  the  veneer  of  civilization  and  beheld  the  elemental  qualities  that  made  them  what  they  were — plodder,  fop,  sophisticate.   _  His  tolerant  understanding  of  human  nature  makes  it  pos-  sible for  him  to  portray  the  widely  diversified  roles  he  has  assumed,  so  successfully.   For  this  reason,  Charles  Laughton  need  never  be  "typed,"  as  the  casting  directors  say.   Watching  his  work  on  the  screen,  you  are  probably  convinced  that  the  man  himself  must  be  a  great  deal  like  his  characteriza-  tions. Stolid  .  .  .  prosaic  .  .  .  even  a  bit  sinister.  Which  is  decidedly  not  the  case.   His  ability  to  submerge  his  own  personality  so  completely,  in  favor  of  the  character  he  is  portraying,  marks  him  as  one  of  the  chosen  few.    Incomparable.    The  real  McCoy.    As  madly  Neronian  as  ever  Nero  managed  to  be — yet  using  a  broad  English  accent  that  bowled  them  over  laughing !  Isn't  that  just  the  turn  you  might  expect,  though,  from  Charles  Laughton,  shown  here  as  he  appeared  in  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross"?    The  real  Laughton  is  a  revelation.  In  private  life,  this  genial  Englishman  is  a  direct  contradiction  to  his  screen  self.  Un-  selfish, unspoiled,  and  with  a  humor  as  rare  as  it  is  subtle,  he  is  a  delightful,  unforgettable  personality.   My  own  first  impression  of  the  man  was  more  or  less  hys-  terical.   He  sat  in  the  office  of  Paramount's  publicity  manager  and  scattered  "still"  pictures  about  the  floor  with  a  dead-pan  non-  chalance that  sent  the  lady  p.m.  into  immediate  hysterics.   "C/w/'-lee!"  she  squealed  protestingly.   Char-lee's  left  eyebrow  quivered  almost  imperceptibly.  Ap-  parently, he  heard  nothing.  More  stills  fluttered  to  the  floor  and  curled  about  his  ankles  like  a  sophomore's  socks.  His  ex-  pression was  one  of  gentle  dignity  and  refinement.

No,  he's  not  dumb.  You've  heard  him  talk  on  the  screen.  And  judging  from  his  success,  you'll  hear  him  more  and  more.   He's  anything  but  dumb  men-  tally, but  there's  a  gap  between  his  thinking  and  his  tongue  that  denies  vocal  expression  to  his  thoughts.  An  interview  with  him  would  pre-  sent a  page  with  nothing  on  it  but  a  photograph!   Of  course,  Hollywood  thought  it  was  a  pose.  Everybody  decided  he  was  trying  to  pull  a  Garbo.   Warren  William  has  become  a  star  in  the  last  three  years  and  yet  this  is  the  first  story  Photoplay  has  had  about  him!  Why?  Thereby  hangs  this  tale.   Whenever  a  magazine  or  news-  paper writer  wanted  to  interview  him,  he  looked  baffled  and  asked  the  studio  publicity  man,  "Why  don't  you  hand  them  that  biog-  raphy I  wrote  for  you?  "  If  he  was,  reluctantly,  induced  to  be  inter-  viewed, he  took  the  scribe  to  lunch-  eon, acted  the  perfect  host,  listened  with  polite  interest — and  said  prac-  tically nothing.  Now,  how  can  you  get  what's  in  the  heart  and  mind  of  a  star  who's  a  taciturn  host,  offer-  ing besides  hospitality  nothing  but  brief,  biographical  notes?   Here  was  a  most  attractive  actor,  who  had  done  big  things  on  the  stage,  had  clicked  on  the  screen  and  was  getting  bigger  and  better  with  every  picture.  Certainly  a  film  star  with  an  interesting  story.  But  how  to  get  it?  His  continued  and  demonstrated  inability  at  conversation  seemed  to  answer,  "Impossible!"   What  to  do?  Where  to  turn?  An  idea!  How  about  Mrs.  Warren  William?   Surely  the  wife  of  a  celebrated  husband  would  be  willing,  indeed  proud,  to  talk  about  him.   Mrs.  William  was  the  answer  to  an  interviewer's  prayer.  Not  only  could  she  talk  about  Warren;  she  did.  And  among  other  items,  she  vouchsafed  the  most  fascinating  revelation  a  reporter  could  ask — the  story  of  how  a  (vocally)  dumb  man  managed  to  win  the  woman  who  is  now  his  wife.   It  began  back  in  those  exalted,  strained  days  when  the  youth    When   interviewers  ask  Warren  William   questions,  his  screen  voice  freezes.  But  the  missus  handles  this  situation  as  competently  as  she  does  her  husband    of  America  were  in  training,  preparing  themselves  to  grapple  with  the  Kaiser's  veterans  in  France.  In  those  anxious  days  petite,  blonde  Helen  Nelson  was  living  in  New  York  City,  and  chanced  to  notice  a  new  photograph  which  graced  the  dresser  of  her  most  intimate  friend.   At  first  she  hesitated  to  ask  questions.  But  each  time  she  looked  at  the  photograph,  she  felt  a  compelling  magnetism.  Finally  she  could  be  polite  no  longer.   "Pauline,  who  is  that  handsome  fellow?"   "That's  my  brother.    He's  an  actor."   Like  most  girls,  Helen  Nelson  pictured  actors  as  charming,  eloquent,  witty — brilliant  conversationalists.  So,  when  Pauline  took  her  to  an  officers'  training  camp  to  meet  her  brother  Warren,  she  knew  exactly  what  to  expect — so  she  thought!   The  girls  had  to  wait  three  hours  before  he  was  free  from  duty.

But  be  most  enthusiastic  about  lyour  husband. "   That  is  what  Norma  Shearer  be-  lieves to  be  the  secret  of  a  woman's  share  in  a  success-  ful marriage.   "No  one  is  more  boring  to  others  than  a  woman  who  is  bored  with  herself,"  says  Norma.  "To  be  interesting,  you  must  be  interested.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  successful  wives  are  the  ones  who  have  for  their  husbands  the  same  enthusiastic  interest  they  felt  for  their  sweethearts.  Please,  if  you  want  to  make  a  success  of  this  business  called  marriage,  re-  fuseever  to  take  it  for  granted,  to  accept  it  casually."   Norma  likes  to  talk  about  marriage.  She  has  thought  a  great  deal  about  it.  This  charming,  com-  pletely poised  young  lady  is  as  thoroughly  Mrs.  Irving  Thalberg,  wife,  as  she  is  Norma  Shearer,  actress.  After  five  years  of  marriage  she  is  as  en-  thusiastic and  interested  in  every  phase  of  it  as  any  bride-to-be,  venturing  forth  with  a  head  full  of  theories,  or  any  young  wife  of  a  few  months,  strug-  gling to  adapt  these  theories  to  practical  living.   For  she  has  successfully  adapted  them.  And  in  doing  so,  she  has  learned  that  the  very  keynote  of  marital  success  is  enthusiasm  and  interest.   She  began  by  blasting  that  time-worn  statement,  "the  first  year  of  married  life  is  the  hardest."   50    Follow  Mrs.  Irving  Thal-  berg's  suggestions  on  how  to  be  happy  though  mar-  ried. But  if  you  can't  or  won't,  then   look   out!   By  Lois    Shirley    "Because,"  she  explained,  logically  enough,  "the  word  'hardest'  should  not  be  used  in  speaking  of  marriage.  With  marriage,  life  becomes  easier.  You  have  the  one  you  love  to  help  you  live  it.  It  seems  to  me  it  would  be  better  to  say  that  the  first  year  of  married  life  is  easy,  and  each  succeeding  year  be-  comes easier. "   Original?  Not  necessarily.  But  at  least  it's  a  fresh  and  wholesome  viewpoint.  It  begins  with  the  as-  sumption that  married  life  is  going  to  be  successful,  and  surely  that  mental  attitude  is  important  and  helpful.   "Of  course,  that  first  year  does  present   difficulties   which   do   not  come  with  later  years.    All  adjust-  ments bring  problems  to  be  solved  and  the  first  few  months  of  mar-  riage are  necessarily  a  period  in  which  two  separate  human  beings  are  becoming  adjusted  and  adapted  to  each  other.    But  there  is  a  vast  difference    between    the  words,  hard  and  difficult.  The  very  fact  that  love  and  romance  and  glam-  our   play    so    strong    a  part   in   that   first   year  makes  the  difficulties  easy. "   NEXT,  she  upsets  the  hallowed  tradition.  Or,  at  least,  changes  it.  She  believes  that  it  is  one  of  themost  difficult  phases  of  the  first  year.  "I  don't  think  that  any  couple  should  take  a  honeymoon  trip  until  after  at  least  six  months  of  marriage,"  Norma  said.   "We  waited  almost  a  year  be-  fore going  to  Europe  for  our  wed-  ding jaunt.  At  the  time  of  our  marriage  our  work  made  an  ex-  tended trip  of  any  kind  impossible.  Now  I  realize  that  it  was  the  wisest  and  best  thing  which  could  i„  .  have  happened.

"Unconsciously,  during  those  first  few  months,  you  are  trying  to  put  your  best  foot  forward.  You  are  a  little  un-  certain of  the  other's  love.  You  wonder  whether  the  other  will  grow  tired  of  seeing  you  each  day,  of  having  you  as  a  vital  and  ever-present  part  of  life.  You  are  filled  with  doubts  as  to  your  own  ability  to  prove  as  interesting  as  he  had  expected,  the  thought  that  you  may  possibly  be  a  heart-breaking  dis-  appointment.   "'  I  'HAT  is  why  it  seems  almost  cruel  to  me  to  send  two  young   i-  people  away  by  themselves  on  a  long  trip,  with  no  prepara-  tion except  the  bewildering  confusion  of  a  wedding  and  all  the  attendant  excite-  ment. After  they  have  stood  the  test  of  everyday  life  for  a  few  months,  the  honey-  moon trip  would  be  a  far  more  beautiful  experience.  The  nervousness  and  self-  consciousness,  the  uncertainties,  would  be  gone. "   There  are  at  least  two  problems  that  soon  raise  their  trite  but  potentially  ugly  heads  in  the  midst  of  the  marriage  haven  and  have  to  be  settled  promptly  and  firmly.  The  first  is  the  task  of  striking  a  happy  medium,  finding  a  common  meeting  ground  upon  which  two  people  of  different  temper-  ament and  disposition  may  base  their  mutual  conduct.  The  second  is  the  old  familiar  "former  friends"  puzzle.   I  asked  Mrs.  Thalberg,  wife  of  five  years'  experience,  how  they  should  be  dealt  with.    Here  are  her  answers:   "Two  people  rarely  feel  in  the  same  mood  at  the  same  moment.  After  marriage  you  can  talk  things  over,  help  each  other  up  or  down  the  mental  scale,  balance  each  other's  whims  and  fancies  in  a  comfortably  satisfactory  manner  impossible  during  the  days  of  courtship.   "A  man  and  woman  of  op-  posite temperaments  can  find  ideal  happiness  in  married  life  if  they  are  wise  and  willing  to  give  and  take.  They  can  help  each  other  to  reach  a  middle  ground  which  will  make  each  a  happier,  more  well-rounded  person.   "r  I  'HE  question  of  friends  is  a  difficult   JL  problem  in  most  marriages.  I  don't  think  it  is  wise  to  attempt  to  mix  two  groups  of  people,  the  friends  of  both,  be-  fore marriage.  It  is  rarely  successful.  And  here,  it  seems  to  me,  is  where  it  is  the  wife's  job  to  make  her  husband's  friends  their  mutual  friends.  Women  are  usually  more  easily  adaptable  socially  than  men.  Women,  too,  have  time  to  keep  up  their  friendships  of  former  years  without  in-  truding them  upon  the  scant  leisure  hours  of  their  husbands. "   I  asked  Norma  Shearer  if,  after  five  years  of  being  married  and  observing  the    Norma  is  in  stride  with  her  husband,  on  the  opposite  page,  because  she's  a  staunch  football  devotee, too    Irving  Thalberg  never  has  his  business  hours  intruded  upon  by  his  wife,  nor  are  domestic  problems  a  topic  of  con-  versation. Norma  is  the  one  who  solves  them    marriages  of  others,  she  could  phrase  any  workable  rules  for  marital  success  that  I  might  pass  on  to  the  readers  of  Photoplay.  Her  blue  eyes  lighted  in  a  quick  and  sympathetic  smile.  She  thought  a  moment,  her  sensitive  mouth  compressed  seriously.     Then  she  spoke  slowly.   "Yes,"  she  said,  "I  think  I  have.  And  you  can  tell  your  readers  that  I  try  to  fol-  low them  myself.  Like  any  other  wife,  I  don't  always  succeed.  But  I  keep  on  trying."   And  here's  the  way  she  told  them  to  me  for  you.   "The  first  rule,  naturally,  is  to  keep  romance  and  enthusiasm  alive  every  da)'.  Make  your  husband  know  that  he  is  as  attractive  to  you  today  as  he  was  the  day  you  were  married.   "Never,  never  ridicule  your  husband  or  argue  with  him  over  personal  matters  when  others  are  present.  Nothing  can  destroy  love  more  quickly  than  ridicule.  A  wife  who  indulges  in  this  form  of  mental  cruelty  loses  something  from  her  married  life  that  can  never  be  quite  regained.   [  PLEASE  TURN  TO  PAGE  116  ]   51    <?(?

I'm  speaking  of  Douglas  Fairbanks  and  young  Doug.   Said  Doug,  Sr.,  "If  you  mean  do  I  have  that  exalted  pride  of  a  parent  when  I  look  at  'George,'  the  answer  is  no.  I  just  think  he's  the  swellest  guy  I  know. "   We  were  dining  at  Pickfair.  There  were  sixteen  people  at  dinner,  all  names  amounting  to  something  in  the  literary,  film  and  artistic  world.   Mary  graced  the  head  of  the  table,  looking  hardly  a  whit  older  than  when  I  first  met  her  many  years  ago.  I  sat  be-  tween Douglas  and  young  Doug.   Dinner  was  half  over.  Even  G.  B.  (Bouquet)  Sterne  could  find  no  fault  with  the  gastronomical  delights  to  be  encountered  in  the  Fairbanks  menage.   Under  the  stimulus  of  excellent  food,  perfectly  served,  con-  versation was  very  lively,  and  contrary  to  the  general  impres-  sion of  Hollywood  parties,  the  repartee  was  brilliant.  Yet  many  times  during  the  evening,  young  Doug  had  topped  every-  one else  with  a  retort  that  sent  the  entire  table  into  peals  of  laughter.   I  turned  to  Douglas  on  my  left  and  said,  "Aren't  you  pretty  proud  of  him?"  to  which  he  answered  as  above.   Many  years  ago  Douglas  started  calling  young  Doug  "George"  and  George  retaliated  by  calling  his  father  "Her-  man."   The  names  stuck.     Then  Douglas  continued.    Doug,  Jr.:    "He's  the  best  friend  I'll  ever  have"   "There  must  be  something  wrong  with  me.  I  know  all  men  are  supposed  to  fairly  burst  with  self-esteem  over  their  par-  ticular progeny,  but  I've  never  felt  that  way."   Yes,  Douglas,  I  thought.  There  is  something  wrong  with  you.  In  a  community  of  egotists,  you  stand  alone,  for  you  are  not  one.   Then  he  went  on  in  that  crisp,  staccato  voice  of  his.   "I  got  a  great  kick  out  of  'George'  being  born  but  I  never  thought  of  him  then  as  my  son,  nor  do  I  now.  To  me,  he  was  always  an  interesting  human  being  with  rights  of  personality  and  thought  that  every  individual  is  entitled  to.   "As  a  matter  of  fact,  from  the  very  first  he  and  I  went  on  the  theory  that  we  had  to  make  good  with  one  another."   I  FELT  as  if  I  wanted  every  male  parent  in  Christendom  to  hear  that  statement.  It  was  the  solution  to  the  eternal  struggle  that  goes  on  between  parent  and  child — age  and  youth.  Doug-  las Fairbanks,  without  intentional  purpose  but  merely  follow-  ing his  inner  feelings,  had  eliminated  the  greatest  evil  of  parent-  hood— ego.   Here  I'd  known  him  for  years  yet  never  suspected  him  cap-  able of  that  kind  of  parental  philosophy,  or  shall  we  call  it  horse  sense.  True,  I'd  never  discussed  fatherhood  with  him.  Pride  in  progeny  is  something  we  just  take  for  granted.   All  women  say  they  adore  babies  and  hope  to  have  a  house  full  of  them.

Hollywood  has  gone  baby  crazy  and  try  to  stop  it.  Try.  Go  on,  I  dare  you.  What's  more,  it  has  Hollywood  licked.  Down  for  the  count  of  ten.   No  longer  does  Hollywood  breathe  in  (and  out)  the  deep  alluring  scent  of  "Scarlet  Night"  perfume.  Now  Hollywood  is  redolent  of  bath  soap.

He  rules  his  domain  with  a  plump  and  grasping  hand  (ah,  ah,  let  go  papa's  toupee)  and  Hollywood  loves  it.    Absolutely  dotes  on  it.   Groups  gather  at  formal  dinners  and  heated  arguments  arise.  Some  hold  out  for  tomato  juice  and  some  for  orange  juice.  Some  for  prune  pulp  and  some  for  coddled  egg.  In  fact,  prune  pulp  cliques  are  formed.  They  meet  on  Wednesdays  and  slan-  der the  coddled  egg  group  that  meets  on  Thursdays.  Life  long  friendships  are  broken  and  lost.  Many  a  prune  pulper  has  openly  walked  out  of  a  picture  that  had  a  coddled  egger  in  its  cast.  What  the  outside  world  doesn't  dream  is  that  the  prune  pulp  hero  of  "Her  Burning  Desire"  openly  and  deliberately  bit  the  ear  of  the  coddled  egg  heroine  in  the  sultriest  love  scene  of  the  picture.    So  you  see:   At  exactly  six  weeks  of  age,  Fredric  March's  baby,  according  to  Fredric  remember,  smiled  openly  at  Fredric  each  and  every  time  he  entered  the  room.  And  I  think  recited  "You  Are  Old,  Father  William  "  and  blew  him  a  kiss,  Fredric  said.  Or  maybe  that  was  Miriam  Hopkins'  baby,  so  we'll  let  it  pass.   But  anyway,  Freddy  bragged  on  that  knowing  smile  'til  people  could  hardly  bear  it.  And  then  came  the  morning  in  the  "Sign  of  the  Cross"  for  Fredric's  great  love  scene.  They  did  it  over  and  over  but  still  it  lacked  something.   54  2    "  What's  the  matter,  Fredric?  "  De  Mille  finally  asked.  "You  don't  seem  yourself  this  morning."   "Well,"  said  Freddy,  his  face  a  picture  of  dejection,  "you  remember  I  told  you  how  my  baby  always  smiled  at  me  every  time  I  entered  the  room."   "Yes,  yes,  go  on,"  the  director  said.   "Well,"  said  Fredric,  "she  laughed  at  me  this  morning."   "My  Gawd,  no,"  screamed  the  director.  "This  is  terrible.  Now  brace  up,  old  man,  and  try  to  forget.  We'll  have  the  lions  eat  the  Christians  this  morning  and  you  can  make  your  love  scene  tomorrow.

The  baby  has  detained  us."   HALF  way  through  the  dinner,  the  Marches  arrived.  "What  is  it?"  everyone  asked  breathlessly.  "Has  any-  thing happened  to  the  baby?  "   "Oh,  no,"  Mrs.  March  replied,  "you  see,  tonight  it  was  Freddy's  turn  to  hold  the  six-thirty  bottle  and  it  took  him  a  bit  longer  than  usual. "   Bebe  Daniels  and  Ben  Lyon  own  one  of  the  most  expensive  and  exclusive  lots  on  the  Santa  Monica  beach.  They  bought  it  for  the  fine  bathing  facilities  it  offered.  Practically  at  their  front  door,  the  ocean  called.   And  then  came  Barbara  Bebe.  Today  that  beach  is  care-  fully wired  off  from  the  ocean.  It's  a  play-yard,  boys  and  girls,  a  play-yard.  No  one  can  possibly  bathe,  except  in  a  tub,  but  what  of  it?    Where  bright  umbrellas  and  bathing  suits  once    Got  Babies/    By  Sara   Hamilton    ILLUSTRATED  BY  VAN  ARSDALE    Underneath  his  tree  sits  Wally,  fishing  pole  in  hand,  while  above  his  head  wave  the    baby's    unmentionables    gleamed,  snow  white  diapers  wave  in  the  balmy  ocean  breeze.  You  could  knock  the  sea  gulls  down  with  a  pin.   Barbara  Bebe  loves  the  bright  light  on  the  radio.  So  the  radio  is  on  full  blast  from  morning  till  night.  Actors  scream  themselves  into  laryngitis  and  can't  go  through  their  scenes  the  next  day,  but  who  cares?  The  baby  loves  the  "ittle  ittie  lightie  to  pay  wis.  "     Cute?   Door-knobs  stick  to  the  hands,  backs  are  practically  broken  on  concealed  toys  on  rollers,  trouser  seats  (to  say  nothing  of  injured  pride)  are  damaged  beyond  recall  in  bowls  of  oatmeal  quaintly  concealed  on  davenports,  the  radio  blares  and  diapers  flap  in  the  ocean  breeze  while  lovely  Bebe  assures  the  guests,  "  You'd  just  never  know  there  was  a  baby  in  the  house.  Never  dream  it. "   "Oh  dear,"  as  ZaSu  would  say.   Then  came  Barbara  Bebe's  first  tooth.  Ben  himself  dis-  covered it.  He  gazed  at  the  amazed  baby  and  like  a  mad  man,  raced  up  the  stairs  and  stood  in  the  doorway  of  Bebe's  room  pawing  the  air  and  making  funny  sounds.    "  A  tooth, "  he  man-    ages to  gasp  at  last,  "she  has  a  tooth."  Wires  hummed,  phones  rang  with  the  news,  cables  sang,  while  Ben  spent  the  day  with  a  movie  camera  lodged  in  the  baby's  mouth  trying  to  lake  a  news-reel  of  the  tooth.   WiU  somebody  hand  over  the  smelling  salts?   S  for  good  old  hard-boiled  Wally  Beery,  he'll  never  be  the  same.  It's  even  got  Wally.  He's  been  called  many  a  name,  has  Wally  Beery,  from  tough  mug  on  up,  but  nothing  anyone  has  ever  called  him  has  affected  Wally  like  the  little  five  letter  word  of  Daddy.  "D-a-d-d-y."  It  does  something  to  Wally's  face  that  brings  a  lump  to  the  throat.  He  haunts  the  baby  shops,  big  lumbering  hands  finger-  ing tiny  silk  garments.  Clutching  one  monstrous  forefinger,  Carol  Ann  toddles  along  beside  this  mountain  of  humanity,  her  daddy.  Together  they  lunch  at  the  Brown  Derby,  or  the  M-G-M  commissary,  Wally  carefully  wiping  her  chin.   And  that  mountain  cabin  of  Wally's.  His  famous  paradise  hide-out.  Whoops  my  dear,  you  should  see  the  dear  old  rus-  tic cabin  now.  Even  its  own  mother  wouldn't  know  it.  Electric  lights,  frigid-  aire,  heating  systems  and  what  have  you.  Carol  Ann  must  have  all  the  comforts  of  home  even  in  the  high  Sierras.  Under-  neath his  tree,  sits  Wally,  fishing  pole  in  hand,  while  above  his  head  wave  the  baby's  white  unmentionables  in  the  mountain  air.  Ah  there,  Wally.   And  there  was  that  never-to-be-forgotten  interview  of  John  Barrymore  with  a  dignified  lady  writer,  when  John  ordered  all  the  dishes  removed  from  the  small  commissary  table  and,  with  the  table  cloth,  demonstrated  his  ability  as  the  champion  diaper  folder  of  the  colony.  Dear  me.  Oh,  I  told  you.    I  tried  to  warn  you.   They  even  rearrange  production  schedules,  an  unheard  of  thing.  For  instance,  Stu  Erwin  was  just  about  to  begin  on  "He  Learned  About  Women"  just  as  the  new  baby  arrived  and  Stu  couldn't  be  pried  away.  He  wouldn't  Learn  About  Women  with  a  new  boy  here,  if  he  never  learned  about  'em.  So  they  rearranged  their  whole  schedule  and  for  one  week  they  shot  scenes  around  him,  until  he  finally  came  back,  dazed  but  happy.   THERE  is  no  sacrifice  too  great.  No  lengths  to  which  they  wouldn't  go  for  their  little  darlings.   For  years  John  Miljan  has  loved  birds.  The  raising  of  canaries  was  John's  consuming  passion.  Along  came  the  new  baby,  the  birds  gave  one  disturbing  cheep  and  it  was  bye  bye  birdies.     "Amscray"  for  the  canaries.   There  was  no  room  available  for  the  baby,  so  John  hauled  a  couch  into  his  dressing-room,  and  there  he  sleeps,  while  baby  occupies  the  front  room  with  the  Southern  exposure.

As  the  dumb  beer-garden  waiter-grappler  who  is  infatuated  with  and  subsequently  marries  a  girl  with  a  prison  record  (Karen  Morley),  Wally  turns  in  another  of  those  flawless,  appeal-  ingly  human  performances  that  stick  in  your  memory.  The  girl  crosses  him  up  with  her  crook  lover  (Ricardo  Cortez),  posing  as  her  brother;  and  Wally 's  love  for  the  other  man's  baby,  believing  it  his  own,  is  genuinely  touching.   Miss  Morley's  work  is  second  only  to  Beery's  own,  and  Cortez  as  the  rat-sweetheart  and  Jean  Hersholt  as  the  beer-  garden  proprietor  do  splendidly.  The  wrestling  shots  look  brutally  real.    ■fr    THE  SIGN  OF  THE  CROSS— Paramount    THE  stage  melodrama  of  our  fathers'  day  comes  to  the  screen  as  a  De  Millean  spectacle  of  gigantic  proportions  marred,  at  times,  by  over-frankness  in  the  presentation  of  details.   Charles  Laugh  ton,  as  Nero,  largely  carries  the  performance  and  the  subtle  satire  of  his  interpretation  is  delightful.  He  does  the  incredible  feat  of  making  the  vicious  Roman  emperor  not  only  convincing  but  almost  likable.  Claudette  Colbert  supports  Laughton  admirably  as  his  equally  wicked  consort,  the  Empress  Poppaca.  Fredric  March  is  given  a  most  difficult  role  to  sustain,  and  because  of  that — and  that  only — must  take  second  honors.  Elissa  Landi,  as  his  Christian  lady  love,  errs  on  the  side  of  frigidity  in  her  acting.   Positively  not  for  children.   56    The    Shadow  Sta    (REG,  U.  S.  PAT.  OFF.)    A  Review  of  the  New  Pictures    *fe    THE  ANIMAL  KINGDOM— RKO- Radio   m   COUNT  the  days  until  you  can  see  this  one.  "The  Animal  Kingdom"  is  adapted  from  the  stage  play,  one  of  those  brilliant  Philip  ("Holiday")  Barry  successes.   Leslie  Howard  and  Ann  Harding  are  so  perfectly  cast  that  you  forget  they  are  playing  a  part.  They  are  Tom  and  Daisy.  And  thank  Heaven,  the  play  has  not  been  sacrificed  to  give  all  to  the  star.  Ann  Harding  actually  has  less  footage  than  Myrna  Loy — but  what  she  does  with  it!   The  story  is  subtle,  human,  with  perfect  dialogue.  Tom,  a  young  publisher  of  beautiful  books,  has  had  a  fine  associa-  tion— more  than  merely  an  affair — with  a  talented  illus-  trator, Daisy,  for  three  years.  They  have  avoided  chaining  each  other  with  ties  or  "duty."  Daisy  is  profoundly  in  love  with  Tom,  who  depends  on  her  friendship,  her  opinion,  her  uncompromising  honesty.   But  he  marries  Cecilia  (Myrna  Loy),  who  gives  her  best  performance  as  this  "nasty-nice"  unscrupulous  woman,  us-  ing sex-allure  with  consummate  cleverness  to  get  what  she  wants.   At  last  he  wakes  up — he  leaves — to  go  back  to  his  real  "wife"  Daisy.   William  Gargan  is  simply  grand  as  an  ex-pug  butler.  Entire  cast  is  excellent.    Don't  miss  this.

Scenarists  Benjamin  Glazer  and  Oliver  H.  P.  Garrett  kept  their  eyes  on  both  Hemingway's  novel  and  the  censors  without  apparent  compromise.  And  Frank  Borzage  merits  another  bright  feather  in  his  directorial  cap.   Helen  Hayes,  a  nurse,  falls  in  love  with  Gary  Cooper,  an  American  who  has  enlisted  in  the  Italian  army.  Torn  be-  tween love  and  duty,  Gary  returns  to  the  front,  and  Helen  to  the  tiny  Swiss  village  to  await  the  coming  of  their  child.  Sensing  her  peril,  Gary  deserts,  fighting  and  dragging  his  way  back  to  her.  He  arrives  a  few  minutes  before  she  dies  while  armistice  bells  ring  about  them.   The  performances  of  Helen  Hayes  and  Adolphe  Menjou  are  among  the  outstanding  of  the  year,  while  Gary  Cooper  probably  does  the  best  work  of  his  career.  Jack  La  Rue  and  Mary  Philips  contribute  splendid  performances.  And  Cinematographer  Lang  must  not  be  forgotten.   The  scenes  showing  the  retreat  of  the  Italian  army  after  the  great  defeat  at  Caporetto  are  especially  magnificent.  A  picture  you  should  see.    A    THE  BITTER  TEA  OF  GENERAL  YEN— Columbia    PRIMARILY  a  triumph  for  Director  Frank  Capra,  this  film  inevitably  invites  comparison  with  "Shanghai  Ex-  press."   Nils  Asther,  as  General  Yen,  in  love  with  a  white  girl  played  by  Barbara  Stanwyck,  steals  the  show.  Stanwyck  fans  may  be  disappointed  to  find  her  in  a  role  which,  while  excellently  handled,  is  secondary.  She  is  engaged  to  a  missionary  when  General  Yen  abducts  her.   The  story,  contrasting  the  Oriental  and  Occidental  philo-  sophies against  a  background  of  war  and  intrigue  at  Chapei,  is  necessarily  slow  in  tempo,  but  absorbing,  and  helps  to  make  logical  the  melodramatic  events.  Most  of  the  plot  hinges  on  the  decision  of  General  Yen  to  "convert  a  Chris-  tian," which  he  does  at  the  cost  of  his  own  life.    it    THE  HALF-NAKED  TRUTH—  RKO-Radio    IF  you  liked  Lee  Tracy  in  "Blessed  Event,"  you'll  like  him  in  this — which,  while  not  quite  of  that  caliber,  very  closely  approaches  it.  A  high-powered  spieler  and  press-  agent  does  his  stuff,  and  how  Tracy  does  it!  He  "sells"  New  York  a  carnival  girl  (Lupe  Velez)  as  an  Indian  Princess  dancer,  and  a  chamber-maid  as  the  high  priestess  of  a  nudist  cult;  the  laughs  come  so  fast  they  leave  you  almost  breathless.   Lupe  is  enticing  both  as  the  carnival  dancer  and  the  princess.  Frank  Morgan  turns  in  a  splendid  performance  as  Merle  Farrell,  the  producer,  and  Eugene  Pallette  helps  keep  the  comedy  ball  rolling  at  a  high  speed,  which  will  make  you  forget  everything  except  that  the  movies  are  mighty  good  medicine  for  the  blues.   57'    The   National   Guide   to   Motion    Pictures    (REG.    U.  S.  PAT.  OFF.)    £    THE  SON-   DAUGHTER-   M-G-M    UNDER-  COVER MAN  — Paramount    DAINTY  as  a  Chinese  doll,  Helen  Hayes  brings  to  the  screen  the  portrayal  of  Lcin  Wha,  son-daughter  of  Dr.  Dong  Tong  (Lewis  Stone).  In  love  with  Tom  Lee  (Ramon  Novarro)  a  prince  [in  disguise,  she  insists  her  father  sell  her  in  order  to  obtain  ammunition  money.  Lcin  Wha  strangles  her  repulsive  husband  (Warner  Oland)  with  his  own  queue.  The  cast  includes  H.  B.  Warner,  Ralph  Morgan,  Louise  Closser  Hale.    IF  you  have  been  resisting  George  Raft  because  you  didn't  like  the  element  his  picture  character  stands  for,  prepare  to  give  up.  Mr.  Raft  will  have  you  right  in  his  pocket  after  this  one.  The  film  is  slow  in  getting  under  way,  but  George's  high  tension  never  relaxes.  The  story  is  about  the  knavery  in  the  hot-bond  racket.  Nancy  Carroll  and  the  rest  of  the  cast  give  good  performances.     Not  for  children.    NO  OTHER   WOMAN—   RKO-Radio    MADAME  BUTTERFLY   — Paramount    IRENE  DUNNE  docs  another  of  those  abused  wives — and  does  it  well.  Her  court-room  scene  is  something  to  get  up  and  cheer  about.  Charles  Bickford  turns  in  a  realistic  performance  as  the  steel-worker  who  makes  millions,  thanks  to  his  ambitious  wife,  and  then  goes  haywire  over  a  blonde  (Gwili  Andre).  Eric  Linden  is  fine  as  the  young  inventor.  Good  entertainment,  but  don't  take  the  kiddies.    BEAUTIFUL  photography  and  the  sensitive  performance  cf  Sylvia  Sidney  revives  this  creaking  old  vehicle  into  a  lovely  production.  Backgrounds  and  seLtings  are  exquisite,  the  whole  feeling  brought  up-to-date.  A  personal  triumph  for  Sylvia  Sidney,  who  beautifully  portrays  the  pathetic  tragedy  of  the  little  geisha  girl  who  loved  not  wisely  but  too  well.  That  Japanese  baby  is  adorable.    Entire  cast  excellent.    ISLAND  OF  LOST  SOULS  — Paramount    LAWYER   MAN—  Warners    A  THRILLER  of  thrillers.  Charles  Laughton,  in  the  role  of  a  demented  scientist  on  an  island,  tries  to  make  human  beings  out  of  animals.  Among  the  monstrosities  created  is  Lota,  the  much  publicized  "  Panther  Woman"  (Kathleen  Burke).  To  test  her  reactions  he  detains  a  shipwrecked  traveler  (Richard  Arlen).  The  uprising  of  beast-men  will  bring  you  out  of  your  seat.   58    BILL  POWELL  in  top  form  as  the  East  Side  attorney  who  goes  Uptown  and  tangles  with  the  political  machine.  Bill  is  excellently  aided  and  abetted  by  a  bang-up  cast— especially  Joan  Blondell  as  his  secretary,  David  Landau  as  the  pork  barrel  boss,  and  that  new  girl,  Helen  Vinson,  who's  going  to  be  heard  from  a-plenty.  If  you  know  any  law,  forget  it— see  the  picture  anyway.    Saves  Yo  ur   Picture    Time    and    Money    THE  DEVIL   IS   DRIVING—   Paramount    THE   MUMMY-   Universal    EDMUND  LOWE  and  James  Gleason  are  employees  of  the  Metropolitan  garage  managed  by  unscrupulous  car  stealers.  Dickie  Moore,  little  son  of  Gleason,  is  run  down  by  one  of  the  car  thieves,  resulting  in  a  show-down  and  Gleason's  death.  Gleason  and  Lowe  are  splendid,  with  Alan  Dinehart,  Lois  Wilson,  Guinn  Williams  and  Wynne  Gibson  turning  in  nice  performances.    Strong  story  gone  astray.    PREPARE  to  thrill  and  shiver  when  Boris  Karloff,  as  an  Egyptian  mummy  brought  to  life,  stalks  through  reels  of  gruesome  horror.  Buried  alive  3,700  years  before  for  having  loved  a  priestess,  Zita  Johann,  the  mummy  attempts  to  bring  back  to  life  his  lost  love,  only  to  find  her  soul  in  a  modern  young  woman.  David  Manners,  Bramwell  Fletcher  and  Arthur  Byron  complete  the  cast.    EMPLOYEES'  ENTRANCE—   First  National    FRISCO  JENNY—  First  National    A  VIVID  story  of  the  '"inside"  of  a  great  department  store  and  the  forces  that  keep  it  moving.  As  the  cruel  and  heartless  store  manager,  Warren  William  gives  one  of  his  finest  performances.  Wally  Ford  and  Loretta  Young,  employees,  are  but  pawns  in  his  hands.  Alice  White  is  a  cute  little  gold-  digging  model,  while  the  late  Albert  Gran,  Ruth  Donnelly  and  Charles  Sellon  contribute  fine  bits.    New  and  entertaining.    ONLY  the  triteness  of  the  story  keeps  this  picture  from  being  great.  Ruth  Chatterton  is  at  her  best  as  Barbary  Coast  Jenny  who,  bereft  of  father  and  lover  during  the  earth-  quake, rises  to  power  through  political  corruption.  She  kills  the  friend  who  threatens  to  expose  her  to  the  son  who  is  district  attorney.  Direction  is  excellent.

[  additional  reviews  on  page  113  ]   59    In  1924,  Mary  MacLaren —  then  a  ranking  movie  favorite  — deserted  her  film  career  to  marry  an  English  colonel  who  was   stationed  in  India    Disillusioned,  four  years  later  she  was  back  in  Holly-  wood. And  now,  a  beautiful,  cultured  woman,  she  hopes  to  make  a  screen  comeback    I    was    o    nee  a    Star    ONCE  the  center  of  the  stage  was  rightfully  mine.  The  kliegs  and  the  cameras  were  focused  on  me.  It  was  what  I  did  that  mattered,  and  mine  was  all  the  adulation,  all  the  attention  showered  upon  success.   Wherever  I  went  people  stared  at  me  and  uttered  my  name.     Dinner   parties  waited  for  me  if  I  happened  to  be  late,  and  directors  showed  me  marked  courtesy.   My  life  was  truly  a  bed  of  orchids.   Now  I  am  one  of  the  extras  among  the  mob.  If  I  am  for-  tunate, I  get  a  "bit"  to  play.  You,  who  used  to  stand  in  lines  before  the  theaters  because  it  was  my  name  up  there  in  the  lights,  now  sit  through  fdm  after  film  never  knowing  that  I  am  even  in  any  of  them.   I  am  only  a  bit  of  "atmosphere,"  one  of  a  hundred,  one  of  a  thousand  other  such,  drifting  unnoticed  across  the  background  of  the  screen.   Your  eyes  are  fixed  today  upon  some  other  star.  It  was  her  name  instead  of  mine  that  drew  you  in.  It  is  her  face,  her  emotions  that  you  watch  now  in  the  close-ups  that  once  were  mine.   But  I  am  still  in  the  picture,  and  I  was  on  the  set  while  it  was  being  made.  I  stood  aside,  one  of  the  many,  watch-  ing this  new  star  in  the  place  that  was  once  my  own.  The  honors  and  attentions  that  I  used  to  know  now  belong  to  her.   60    But  today  I  must  take    my  place  in  the  ranks  of    countless    extras   By  Mary  MacLaren    Do  you  remember  "Shoes,"  a  picture  which,  in  1915,  was  possibly  as  great  a  sensation  as  "Grand  Hotel"  is  today?  Do  you  remember  "The  Petal  on  the  Current,"  Fannie  Hurst's  beautiful  love  story?      Do  you  remember — ■   But, of  course,  you  don't.  These  were   among  my  pictures.     I  was  starred  in   them.   Do  you  remember  Lois  Weber,  the  woman  director,  who  in   my  time  was  as  important  a  figure  in  the  motion  picture  world   as  Lewis  Milestone  or  Ernst  Lubitsch  is  today?   No,  I  suppose  you  wouldn't.  What  of  her?  Well,  she  dis-  covered me.   You  do  know  "Call  Her  Savage,"  though.  You've  seen  it,  perhaps.  You  didn't  notice  me,  to  be  sure;  you  were  nat-  urally watching  Clara  Bow.  But  I  was  there  just  the  same.  I  was  one  of  the  crowd  in  that  ballroom  scene  where  Clara  Bow  and  Thelma  Todd  pulled  each  other's  hair.  Just  one  of  the  crowd  drifting  through.  Clara  Bow  had  the  spot  where  I  used  to  be.   You  possibly  have  seen  "Ladies  They  Talk  About,"  too.  You  went  to  that  to  see  Barbara  Stanwyck,  but  you  might  also  have  seen  me.  However,  you  wouldn't  know  anything  about  that.   Perhaps  you  took  in  "The  Devil  Is  Driving."

It's  a  dress,  like  this  one  of  Constance  Cum-  mings' — perfect  for  dinner  or  the  hours  after.  A  positive  essential    to    the    smart   wardrobe    at    any    season.    CONSTANCE  wears  this  charming  white  silk  crepe  dress  to  dinner  in  her  new  picture  "Billion  Dollar  Scandal."  For  the  new  season,  you  will  want  it  in  one  of  the  pastel  tones,. perhaps  "Moonlight  blue"  which  sounds  as  romantic  as  this  gown  looks.  Here  you  see  both  back  and  front.  Note  the  demure  back  detail  which  shows  just  a  slit  of  decolletage.  The  deep  girdle  and  the  softly  puffed  sleeves  are  all  a  part  of  its  charm.  For  dancing  pur-  poses, you  will  want  the  skirt  in  a  more  modified  length.    SILK    RATINE    IN    PINK   LOVELY  Jean  Arthur  has  returned  to  the  screen  in  "The  Past  of  Mary  Holmes.'-*  Walter  Plunkett  has  used  a  shell  pink  silk  ratine  for  this  graceful  gown  which  she  wears  at  a  dinner  party  in  her  home.  It  is  perfect  in  its  simplicity —  the  fabric   is  distinctive   and   new   for  now  and  spring.    LIKE  Constance  Cummings'  dress  on  the  opposite  page,  Jean's  is  adaptable  for  formal  or  informal  affairs.  Sleeves  puff  out  below  a  dropped  shoulder — the  neckline,  high  in  front,  is  cut  to  a  deep  "V"  at  back.  A  jeweled  clip  and   bracelet   in   pearls  and   gold   are   charming  accents.    New  Notes   F    rom   Hollywood    THERE'S  nothing  quite  so  satisfactory  as  a  soft  wool  suit  to  wear  under  your  winter  coat.  Nancy  Carroll  wears  a  trim,  youthful  one  in  "Child  of  Manhattan."  This  suit  has  been  dupli-  cated for  you  in  a  fine  rabbit's  hair  cloth  in  black  with  a  very  flattering  ruffled  blouse  of  white  woven  crinkled  organdy.  Although  it  is  difficult  to  discern  the  detail  of  the  suit  in  this  photograph,  Robert  Kalloch  has  used  careful  tailoring  in  the  line  of  the  jacket  and  skirt.  The  jacket  is  held  together  by  buttons  arranged  in  the  manner  of  a  man's  tuxedo — the  skirt  is  slightly  full  with  the  blouse  tucked  into  it.  Nancy  carries  a  smart  black  suede  handbag  trimmed  with  copper  initials.    plNGER.  ROGERS  has  a  vjflair  for  wearing  the  type  of  gay,  young  clothes  you  would  like  to  have  for  your-  self. That's  why  it  is  so  nice  to  know  that  you  can  actually  buy  some  of  her  picture  fash-  ions. Take  this  clever  checked  woolen  dress  she  wears  in  "Forty-Second  Street,"  it  is  a  green  and  brown  combina-  tion with  contrasting  brown  crepe  belt  and  collar.  A  trick  copper  buckle  on  the  belt — and  buttons  used  in  an  amusing  way.    By  Orry-Kelly.    CHAMOIS  is  quite  the  newest  thing  under  the  sun  in. accessories — you  could  wear  these,  sketched  here,  for  both  tailored  and  sports  costumes.  The  chamois  belt  has  a  smart  wooden  buckle.  The  bag  has  a  tortoise  shell  top.  And  the  gloves  die  pull-ons  with  stitching.    TWO  gadgets  for  your  purse  are  these,  above.  One  is  a  white  kid  covered  cigarette  case.  You  pull  back  the  top  and  out  pops  a  cigarette.  A  speckled  green  en-  amel    compact    is    square   and    flat.    THE  very  newest  note  in  accessories  must  accompany  your  Holly-  wood frock.  There's  the  trio,  above.  A  black  suede  belt  with  metal  buckle  that  but-  tons together.  A  new  gold  clip  looks  like  an  egg  beater!  And  a  white  kid  glove  is  draped  with  a  button.    ANOTHER  attractive  dress  from  the  "Billion  Dollar  Scandal"  is  this  one  in  silk  crepe  worn  by  Constance  Cummings,  at  left.  Again  the  soft  sleeves  puff  becomingly  and  the  scarf  neckline  is  charming.  You'll  like  it  to  wear  right  now  under  a  dark  coat — in  a  bright  tone.    WALTER  PLUNKETT  has  de-  signed an  unusually  attrac-  tive dress  for  Jean  Arthur  to  wear  in  the  court  scene  of  "The  Past  of  Mary  Holmes."  It  is  a  navy  blue  rough  silk  crepe  with  a  high  neckline  and  jabot.  Its  lines  are  slim  and  tailored.  To  make  it  becoming  for  you  with  dark  hair,  it  has  been  made  up  with    white    collar   and    jabot.    EPAULET  clips  are  the  newest  rage   for  evening  gowns.  These,  sketched  above,  show  you   how  they   fasten.    A  dark  silk  slip  with   ecru    lace   is    perfect   for  dark  dresses.    WHEN  you  see  "Hot  Pepper,"  look  for  this  attractive  evening  gown  worn  by  Lilian  Bond.  Earl  Luick  de-  signed it  for  a  nightclub  scene.  It  is  made  in  one  of  the  new  silk  crepes  with  an  interesting  texture.  The  frills  over  the  shoulders  are  satin.  Straps  of  the  crepe  fasten  over  these  with  buckles.     This  gown  is  sketched  above.     Isn't  it  smart?    IOAN  BLONDELL  is  playing  "  Blondie  Johnson."  When  vJyou  see  her  in  the  picture,  you  will  find  her  wearing  some  very  smart  clothes.  One  of  them  is  this  evening  ensemble.  The  short  jacket  is  beige  with  brown  buttons.  The  sleeves  are  fitted  to  the  elbow  where  fullness  starts.  Note  the  wide  lapels.  The  dress  of  brown  crepe  is  designed  for  double  duty  purposes,  it  may  be  worn  evenings  without  the  jacket.    /^AROLE  LOMBARD  knows  how  to  choose  v — smart  clothes  and  wear  them  well  both  on  and  off  the  screen.  In  "No  Man  of  Her  Own/'  she  plays  the  role  of  a  young  librarian  who  marries  a  man  of  means — as  you  can  imagine,  this  gives  her  a  grand  opportunity  to  wear  some  stunning  costumes.  One  of  them  is  this  attractive  black  crepe  dress  trimmed  in  white.  Isn't  the  ruffled  cuff,  placed  above  the  elbow,  a  unique  detail?  The  ruffled  collar  is  espe-  cially flattering  about  the  neckline — all  in  all,  an  idea  dress  for  you  to  choose  for  this  season.  Don't  miss  the  clever  use  of  buttons  on  both  the  cuffs  and  collar.  Travis  Banton  is  the  designer — as  you  will  recall,  he  has  done  some  beautiful   costumes    for  Carole.    LOUNGING  pajamas  have  become  indispensables  to  everyone's  wardrobe.  Especially  pajamas  of  the  type  worn  by  Claire  Dodd  in  "Hard  to  Handle.''  This  pajama,  shown  at  left  below,  combines  the  prac-  tical tailored  qualities  with  nice  feminine  detail.  A  light  blue  crepe  is  contrasted  with  a  darker  blue  trim.  The  trousers  are  quite  mannish  in  their  center  creasing.  The  bodice  is  intricately  cut  and  is  topped  by  a  high  collar  tied  nonchalantly  like  a  scarf.  Full  sleeves  are  gathered  into  a  tight  cuff,  tied  like  the  collar.  This  is  an  Orry-Kelly  design.  Don't  over-  look those  slash  pockets.     Claire  is  wearing  sandals.

In  the  palace  of  the  czar,  at  this  mystic  hour  of  the  night,  what  is  John  Barrymore  saying  to  czarina  Ethel?  "Get  rid  of  that  monk,  Rasputin!"  might  be  a  safe  guess.  And  Ethel  for  the  moment  has  a  doubt.  But,  careful  John,  there's  eaves-dropping  going  on!    Don't  you  see  that  huge  "mike"  overhead?    I  Got  A   D   B    lvorce    99    ecause    Maurice  Chevalier,  for  the  first  time,  tells  why  he  and  Yvonne  Vallee  broke    the    marriage    bonds    f^^kl    -   /**»    By    Vi rg inia  Ma  xwell    S:    IXCE  the  surprise  volley  of  Chevalier's  sudden  divorce  in  Paris  last  summer — a  divorce  he  had  I  sought  to  keep  secret  from  the  world — he  has  hidden  himself  away  from  interviewers.   Maurice,  a  shy  fellow  at  heart,  feared  terribly  the  glaring  spotlight  of  publicity  which  he  realized  American  curiosity  might  turn  upon  him.  American  women  are  curious  about  the  dapper  Frenchman,  who,  presumably  happily  married  to  his  little  French  wife,  Yvonne,  suddenly  up  and  divorced  when  everyone  least  expected  it.   Maurice  evaded  newspapermen  in  Paris  when  news  of  the  affair  leaked  out.     He  shied  away  from  all  questioners.    And  then,  quite  unaware  that  he  might  step  accidentally  into  the  tentacles  of  an  interview,  he   found  himself,  one  afternoon  recently,  chatting  merrily  about  every-  thing in  the  world,  except  his  divorce.   Chevalier  was  in  New  York,  on  his  personal  appearance  tour.  And  New  York  means  gay  little  gatherings — tea  parties  they're  usually  called — where  folks  chat  informally.   I'd  known  Maurice  Chevalier  since  that  memorable  day,  five  years  ago,  when  he  stepped  from  a  transatlantic  liner  to  face  a  battery  of  reporters  and  cameramen,  confident  that  his  in-  imitable smile  would  make  him  rich  and  famous  in  the  land  of  plenty.   He  was  right.  But  he  is  a  different  Maurice  since  then.  There  is  an  air  of  seriousness  about  his  blue  eyes  when  he  looks  at  you,  as  if  those  eyes,  once  accustomed  to  the  peasant  fields  of  peaceful  France,  had  suddenly  seen  the  shadowy  ghost  which  haunts  the  famous.   Maurice  was  in  a  thinking  mood  when  I  asked  him  if  he  were  still  happy,  as  happy  as  that  first  day,  five  years  ago.   He  had  just  arrived  again — this  time  without  his  wife.  Quite  alone.   "Of  course,  I  am  'appy.  And  why  not?"  He  threw  up  his  hands  in  that  little  gesture  which  has  made  him  so  beloved  on  the  screen  and  his  eyebrows  went  up  in  surprise.   "Well,  some  of  your  followers  are  wondering  lots  of  things  about  you,  Maurice,"  I  began  cautiously.  "Thev  Pr<»  wanting  to  know  why  you  got  a  divorce — uv.y  the  sudden  siiiasii-up  ol  a  marriage  everyone  believed  to  be  han;  v."    Bound  for  la  belle  France  just  after  his  big  success  in  "The  Smiling  Lieutenant,"  M.  Maurice,  with  Madame  at  his  side,  looked  quite  happy,  though  perhaps  her  smile  was  just  a  bit  enigmatical.  Was  there  even  then  the  undercurrent  of  matrimonial   unrest   that  was   eventually   to   separate   them?    If  anyone  had  told  me  a  movie  actor  could  actually  blush,  I  wouldn't  have  believed  it.  But  Maurice's  jolly  cheeks  turned  a  little  crimson  and  I  felt  sorry  instantly  that  I  had  asked  the  question.   "Oh,  but  my  dear  Madame  Maxwell,"  he  flustered,  "that  ees  so  very  private — so  very,  very  private — in  Europe  we  never  speak  of  such  things — eet  ees  unchivalrous — eet  ees  mean —  eet  ees  terrible — no."   "T'M  sorry  to  seem  rude,  Maurice,  but  I  was  only  asking  in  ■i-the  name  of  curiosity  for  thousands  of  other  women  who  have  always  admired  you  in  pictures  and  who  now  are  frankly  amazed  at  your  marital  smash-up."   Maurice's  eyes  opened  wide  for  a  moment  as  if  he  were  surprised  anyone  would  wonder  about  anything  so  private.  We  sat  down  across  from  each  other  and  he  offered  me  a  cigarette.   "And  what  are  they  saying  about  me?"  he  asked,  thought-  fully.   "They  are  saying,  for  one  thing,  that  your  movie  success  turned  your  head — that  the  little  woman  who  was  your  wife  back  there  in  the  serenity  of  a  French  household,  became  a  bit  burdensome  in  Hollywood  when  your  time  was  claimed  by  a  world  of  other  admiring,  beautiful  women.     N'est-ce-pas?"   Chevalier's  eyes  flashed.   "Eet  ees  not  so — eet  could  not  be  so.

Her  expert  services  are  now  freely  at  your  disposal.  Sec  In  r  statement  on  the  opposite  page.  Ad-  dress Sylvia,  in  care  of  PHOTOPLAY,  221  W.  57th  St.,  New  York  City.    DO  you  want  to  look  like  Connie?    Do  you  envy  her  at-  tractiveness, her  grace,  her  poise?  Listen — you  girls  and  women — if   Connie  is  your  ideal;  if  you  are,  basically,  the  Connie  Bennett  type —  listen  while  I  tell  you  exactly  how  I  treated  her  and  what  system  I  used  to  help  make  her  the  lovely  woman  she  is  today.  And  you  can  do  for  yourselves  what  I  did  for  her.   The  first  time  I  heard  about  Connie  was  when  Joe  Kennedy,  at  that  time  head  of  the  Pathe  Studios,  came  into  my  office  and  told  me  about  this  new  star,  the  daughter  of  Richard  Bennett,  whom  he  had  just  signed  up.  "But,"  he  said,  "she  is  very  thin.  Do  you  think  you  can  do  anything  with  her?"   "You  bet  I  can,"  I  said.  "I  can  take  off  pounds  or  put  them  on.    Lead  me  to  your  new  beauty."   A  few  nights  later,  I  was  asked  to  a  dinner  party  at  Kennedy's  house.  Gloria  Swanson,  who  has  been  my  patient  for  some  time,  was  there,  and  over  in  a  corner,  sitting  all  humped  over  in  a  short  fur  coat,  was  a  sickly  looking  girl.   "Who  is  that?"  I  whispered  to  Gloria.   "That's  Constance  Bennett,"  she  said.   "Why,  the  poor  kid  is  sick,"  I  said  and  went  over  to  talk  with  her.  I  saw  that  her  face  had  a  grayish  look  and  she  was  much  too  thin.  I  could  also  tell  that  she  was  a  bundle  of  nerves.  She  told  me  she  had  been  trying  all  over  Europe  to  gain  weight  and  couldn't.   A  couple  of  days  after  that  I  got  a  hurry  call  to  go  straight  to  her  hotel  (she  was  living  at  the  Beverly  Wilshire,  then).  Now  I  had  said  I  wouldn't  take  Connie  as  a  patient  until  I  was  sure  it  was  all  right  with  her  physician  for  me  to  do  so.  But  she  looked  so  pitiful  that  night  that  I  relented.   BEFORE  I  tell  you  just  what  sort  of  person  Connie  Bennett  really  is,  I'm  going  to  tell  you  everything  I  did  for  her  and  made  her  do,  and  if  you're  thin  and  underweight  and  suffering  from  nerves  you  can  follow  this  program.   The  first  night  she  was  very  nervous — and  a  little  later  I'm  going  to  tell  you  some  of  the  reasons  that  Connie  gets  nervous—  so  for  an  hour  I  gave  her  a  gentle  massage  with  hot  cocoa  oil.  You  can  do  this  for  yourself.  Rub  gently  with  your  hands  over  your  body,  paying  particular  attention  to  the  solar  plexus,  for  that  is  a  nerve  center,  until  you  feel  those  muscles  relaxed.  Then  work  on  the  face  nerves  and  muscles,  digging  in  with  the  fingers  at  the  cheek  bones  and  working  gently  around  the  eyes.   70    Then,  lying  on  your  stomach  (you  thin  girls  can  do  this,  for  you  usually  have  long  arms)  work  all  up  and  down  your  spine  with  your  fingers,  digging  under  the  vertebrae.  I  worked  like  this  for  an  hour  with  Connie,  and  when  I  left  her  she  fell  right  to  sleep.   She  had  to  get  up  at  seven  o'clock  every  morning  she  was  working.  All  reports  to  the  contrary,  she  was  never  late  at  the  studio.  But  before  leaving  for  work  she  had  her  breakfast  and  I'm  going  to  tell  you  about  it.  When  she  first  got  up  she  had  a  glass  of  water  with  a  few  drops  of  lemon  juice  in  it — that's  mar-  velous for  the  complexion.  When  she  was  dressed  she  sat  down  to  this  breakfast.    It  will  put  weight  on  all  thin  girls.   Hominy  with  a  sliced  over-ripe  banana  and  cream.  Whole  wheat  toast  and  plenty  of  butter  and  honey.  Glass  of  milk.  Cup  of  hot  tea  (this  was  Connie's  choice).   At  eleven  o'clock,  she  had  brought  to  her  a  big  glass  of  orange  juice.  It  is  a  stimulant,  and  when  you  need  something  to  keep  you  going  take  orange  juice.  It  will  keep  you  pepped  up  at  a  fast  speed  for  four  hours.     But      [  please  turn  to  page  96  ]    Connie  Bennett    Are  you  the  Constance  Bennett  type?  Sylvia  reveals  in  this  article  the  exact  methods  she  employed  in  treating  the  famous  star  and  in  bringing  her  to  radiant  health.  (Inset)  Sylvia    Thick  Ankles  Dear  Sylvia:   What    can   I    do    for    thick   ankles?      My    legs    are    thin   enough,  okay  in  fact,  but  my   ankles  are  thick  and  look  ugly.   Mrs.  B.  H.,  Detroit,  Mich.   Put  a  Turkish  towel  over  your  ankles  and,  with  the  palm  of  your  hand,  pound  the  flesh  beneath  the  towel  as  hard  as  you  can.  Don't  be  afraid  of  hurting  yourself.  Hit  —  and  hit  hard.  Then  here's  an  exer-  cise. Lie  flat  on  the  floor  with  arms  above  your  head  and  toes  pointed  downwards.  Without  moving  your  toes  spring  to  a  sitting  position  and  try  to  touch  your  toes  with  your  finger  tips.  Of  course,  you  can't  touch  your  toes,  but  that's  not  the  idea.   You  can  feel  the  muscles  pull-  ing in  your  ankles.  It's  a  wonderful  exercise.  Do  it  fif-  teen or  twenty  times  a  day.   Sagging  Chin  Dear  Sylvia:   I'm  not  old — only  twenty-  six — and  yet  my  chin  is  begin-  ning to  sag.  The  rest  of  my  face  looks  young  but  the  muscles  of  my  chin  are  droop-  ing. What  do  you  suppose  causes  this?   S.  H.  R.,  Hopkinsville,  Ky.   I  can't  tell  you  what  causes  it — maybe  you  stand  wrong  and  throw  your  chin  too  far  forward — but  I  can  tell  you  how  to  cure  it.  Every  night  and  every  morning  smear  your  chin  with  a  good  cold  cream  and  then  with  the  palm  of  one  hand  rub  down  from  the  tip  of  your  chin  to  your  chest,  and  with  the  back  of  the  other  hand  rub  up  from  your  chest  to  the  tip  of  your  chin.  As  you  do  this,  be  sure  to  dig  well  under  the  chin  and  relax  the  muscles  of  your  chin — don't  hold  them  tight — as  you  work  with  your  hands.  Then  with  the  backs  of  both  hands  slap  hard  under-  neath your  chin.  Do  this  twice  a  day  and  watch  the  results.

Exercises  for  the  Sick  Dear  Sylvia:   Because  of  an  illness  in   which  I  have  to  lie  flat  in  bed  I   have  grown  too  fat.    I'll  be  able  to  get  up  in  a  couple  of  months   and  I  don't  want  to  look  so  fat.    Isn't  there  some  exercise  that   you  can  give  me  to  do  in  bed  to  reduce?   H.  F.,  Chicago,  111.   I'd  certainly  have  to  know  more  about  your  illness  first  or  I  might  give  you  the  wrong  exercise.  Usually,  when  people  have  been  in  bed  a  long  time  they  lose  that  surplus  weight  when  they  get  up  and  start  to  move  around.  Write  me  again  and  tell  me  what  your  trouble  is  and  whether  the  doctor  says  you  can  take  any  sort  of  exercise  or  not.

Cer-  tainly much  is  to  be  said  for  it.  Colleen's  straight  hair  is  slightly  waved  toward  the  ends,  which  are  turned  up  or  under,  according  to  caprice.    72    All  the  beauty  tricks  of  oil  the  stors  brought  to  you  each  month    ^ — today  with  the  Colleen  of  six  years  ago,  shown  in  circle!

Clara's  exotic  brows  harmonize  with  her  mahogany  hair.  Unless  your  hair  is  very  dark  or  silvery  blonde,  avoid  a  black  brow  pencil  or  dye,-  use  brown;  in-  stead.    Spare    the    brows   and    concentrate   on   the   eyes.

They  are  far  more  eloquent  than  eyes  or  mouth,  for  these  we  have  learned  to  veil.  But  hands  have  a  way  of  telling  all — that  you  are  fastidious,  dainty,  careful  in  your  personal  ways,  or  careless,  neglectful  of  the  fine  points  that  create  charm  and  loveliness.   If  you  will  use  your  hands  gracefully,  keep  the  skin  soft  and  smooth,  nails  well-groomed,  your  hand  beauty  is  assured.  In  your  business,  social  and  home  life,  in  achievement  and  per-  sonal adornment,  hands  are  all-  important.  To  say  that  you  may  often  stand  or  fall  by  your  hands  alone  is  no  exaggeration.   The  listless,  lily  hand  is  a  thing  of  yesterday,-  today's  hands  do,  and  through  doing  become  strong,   capable    and    beautiful.

The  waves  are  wide  and  irregular,  the  forehead  hair-line  re-  vealed in  an  unusual  manner.  The  left  part  is  very  low.  I  think  this  type  bob  will  be  in  good  style  for  years  to  come.    THE  back  is  devoid  of  wave  until  the  ends  turn  upward  in  masses  of  heavy  curls.

Had  been,  in  fact,  one  of  the  legion  whom  ZaSu  had  helped  in  time  of  need.  People  about  us  were  howling  as  usual  at  ZaSu.  Suddenly,  through  the  laughter,  I  was  conscious  that  this  woman,  sitting  next,  was  very  quiet.  And  still.  And  then  I  heard  through  the  laughter,  strange  little  sounds,  like  sup-  pressed or  choked  sobs  in  her  throat.  I  wondered.  "I  don't  mind,"  I  heard  her  say  later  to  her  escort,  "I  don't  mind  them  making  her  funny.  It  takes  a  great  actress  to  be  funny.  But  why,  why  do  they  make  her  look  like  that?  Why,  ZaSu's  the  most  beautiful  woman  I  have  ever  seen!"   ZaSu  Pitts  is  a  lovely  woman.  Her  eyes  are  deep  violet.  Great,  round  lovely  eyes  that  never  smile.  "The>'  weep,"  some  one  said,  "even  when  ZaSu  is  funniest."  Her  hands  are  slim  and  beautiful,  her  feet  and  ankles  are  quite  the  trimmest  in  town,  her  figure  slender  and  graceful,  her  features  small  and  lovely.    About  her  clings  an  indefinable,  ethereal  quality.   And  yet,  you  know  what  they  do  with  her  on  the  screen.   Oh,  it's  a  strange  story,  I  tell  you,  this  story  of  ZaSu   Pitts.  D  C"        .   She  stole  into  this  land  of  movies  a  J   78    quiet  little  wraith  of  a  person,  unknown  and  certainly  un-  wanted. Her  mother  thought  ZaSu  should  be  an  actress.  So  after  graduating  from  high  school  (with  honors,  and  the  best  tennis  player  in  the  school)  she  donned  her  best  taffeta  dress,  grabbed  up  her  little  straw  suitcase  and  bid  Santa  Cruz,  California,  farewell.  She  was  on  her  way  to  Hollywood.  Alone  and  lonely.  She  had  never  been  away  before  by  herself.  And  yet,  here  she  was,  starting  out  to  conquer  the  world.   And  at  eighteen,  ZaSu  was  playing  in  pictures— tiny  bits  as  old  maids  or  fussy  old  women.  But  there  were  days  when  a  homesick,  heartsick  little  girl  sat  alone  in  her  poor  little  hotel  room,  and  cried  out  her  heart  in  loneliness  and  defeat.  She  was  backward,  unused  to  the  ways  of  movies.     She  suffered.   Later,  she  moved  to  the  Studio  Club  in  Hollywood.  Sur-  rounded by  girls  like  herself,  normal,  fun-loving  girls,  all  eager  and  anxious  to  get  on  in  the  movies,  life  became  a  little  mere  pleasant.  In  fact,  ZaSu,  with  her  funny  little  ways  and  under-  standing heart,  was  the  pet  of  the  club.  Things  picked  up.  She  got  herself  a  nice  part  in  Mary  Pickford's  picture,  "The  Princess,"  as  a  drab  little  slavey.  TJ  '  J  i  And  was  thrilled  and  happy.

Players  on  the  wrong  side  of  the  foot-  lights! Well,  if  Mae  West  insists  on  seeing  the  pretty  chorines  "hoof"  ...  I  suppose  you'll  have  to  give  in,  Director  Lowell  Sherman,  and  let  Alice  White,  Cary  Grant  and  Wynne  Gibson  have  a  little  fun.  For  a  star  can  do  no  wrong.    Even  though  her  picture's  called  "She  Done  Him  Wrong"   A  FTER   all   these   years   it  does  come  as  something  of  a  shock  and  we  hope  Alice  White  and  Cy  Bartlett  have  some  explana-  tion to  offer.   A  spy  reports  Cy  was  seen  in  the  Brown  Derby,  lunching  with  two  girls,  while  at  a  table,  some  distance  away,  Alice  sat  with  a  couple  of  other  people.   TT  was  the  irony  of  something  or  other  that   Bob  Savage  should  arrive  in  Hollywood  the  day  Clara  Bow  left.   Six  years  ago  they  were  such  pals.   Only  the  fact  the  marriage  license  bureau  closed  at  five  o'clock  kept  them  from  getting  married  one  night.   They  arrived  for  their  license  ten  minutes  too  late.   Later  still,  Bob  pulled  that  suicide  gag —  but  not  soon  enough  to  keep  him  from  writing  some  sloppy  verse.   In  the  intervening  six  years,  Bob  has  been  to  South  Africa,  and  many  other  places.   "I  haven't  been  crazy  over  a  girl  for  six  years,"   he   said.   "No,  it's  not  because  of  Clara.  She's  married  now,  happily,  I  am  told,  and  that's  the  end  of  that.   "Maybe  I'll  find  another  girl  somewhere  some  day  but  so  far  I  haven't  had  much  luck."   T^ICK  POWELL  and  Patricia  Ellis  are  "^"'playing  opposite  each  other  in  a  picture  over  on  the  Warner  lot.  And  when  the  day's  work  is  over,  what  do  Dick  and  Patricia  do  but  stay  right  in  character.  Or  you  could  figure  it  out  another  way  and  say  they  weren't  playing  any  of  the  time.   This  one  looks  pretty  serious.  And  what  about  it,  Mary  Brian?   '  I  'HE  announcement  of  the  engagement  of   Estelle     Taylor     and     John     Warburton,   credited  to  John  by  a  news  service,  evidently   84    was  all  that  was  needed  to  break  the  engage-  ment, if  it  ever  existed.   Estelle  denied  it  vehemently  for  the  public  and  what  she  said  to  John  privately,  of  course,  was  private.   In  any  event,  he  is  back  in  circulation  again,  dining  and  dancing  with  a  different  girl  every  night  and  rumors  that  Estelle  may  re-  marry Jack  Dempsey  are  gathering  momentum.   TQF.LIEVE   it   or  not,  Fifi  Dorsay  and  her  "Four  Riders  of  the  Argentine,"  as  Holly-  wood calls  them,  are  still  going  strong.   During  the  Olympic  games  in  Los  Angeles  last  summer,  the  four  Argentine  riders  caught  one  glimpse  of  Fifi  and  then  refused  to  go  home.   So  no  matter  where  Fifi  goes  these  days,  there  are  the  four  Argentines  in  her  wake.  Fortunately,  they  don't  take  their  horses.   r^LARA  BOW!

UNQUESTIONABLY,  the  workers  and  the  doers  get  the  good  things  in  this  life.  Es-  pecially beauty,  vivacity,  appeal.   Until  I  went  to  Hollywood  recently,  it  never  occurred  to  me  that  the  stars  and  the  near-  stars  are  among  the  hardest  working  women  on  this  earth  today.  Now,  when  I  meet  them  here  in  New  York  on  vacation,  business  or  personal  appearance  tours,  I  become  very  conscious  of  my  own  inactivities.  These  girls  struggle  for  a  spare  hour  or  two,  and  even  their  vacations  are  spotted  with  interviews,  appearances,  busi-  ness appointments.  Yet,  they  somehow  man-  age to  look  their  loveliest  and  to  be  cordial  and  pleasant  under  trying  circumstances.   I  think  they  are  a  lesson  and  a  great  inspira-  tion for  everyone  who  desires  loveliness  and  charm  If  the  deep,  deep  secret  of  beauty  and  all  the  good  things  that  both  men  and  women  want  in  themselves  could  be  whispered  in  the  magic  formula  of  two  words,  they  would  prob-  ably be  these:    Do  things.   Recently  I  had  tea  with  Sue  Carol,  radiant,  i  not.-  beautiful  than  I  have  ever  seen  her.  Yet  the  last  year  has  been  more  eventful  than  any  other  in  Sue's  life.  For  Miss  Carol  Lee  Stuart,  her  young  daughter,  arrived,  July  8th.  But  Sue  goes  on  with  her  career  and  numerous  other  interests,  probably  doing  all  a  little  bit  I  tetter  than  before.   Then  there  was  Jean  Harlow  a  while  ago.  Jean  had  been  on  tour  twenty-three  successive  weeks,  making  four  or  five  appearances  daily.  Yet  Jean  was  still  as  voluptuously  beautiful  as  ever.  Shortly  after,  she  was  to  meet  with  star-  dom and  bitter  heart-break  as  well.   Clara  Bow  is  among  the  newest  of   these   86    doers  to  claim  attention.  'Sou  have  only  to  look  at  present-day  pictures  of  Clara  to  see  that  something  important  has  happened  to  her.  She  has  changed,  and  I  think  we  shall  all  like  the  new  Clara  better  than  the  old,  who  let  for-  tune rule  her  instead  of  ruling  fortune,  herself.  When  Clara  began  to  take  her  own  life  into  her  hands,  things  happened,  changes  came  about,  and  Clara's  acting,  at  least,  was  hailed  as  it  never  was  before.

Don't  wait  for  things  to  work  out.  If  you're  not  satisfied  with  your  looks,  decide  just  what  is  wrong  and  begin  to  correct  it.  If  life  is  narrow  and  dull  for  you,  try  to  find  some  outside  interest-.  Keep  yourself  busy.  Don't  give  yourself  time  in  which  to  concentrate  on  yourself  and  worry.  Find  things  to  do,  preferably  happy  things.  Try  to  make  yourself  what  you'd  like  to  be.  You  may  succeed,  and  certainly  you  will  save  yourself  the  agony  of  self-reproach.   SENSIBLE  care,  I  find,  is  very  prevalent  among  the  stars.  Enough  sleep!  Yet  how  we  shy  away  from  it  if  we're  very  young.  A  bugaboo,  a  stop  signal,  that  shuts  out  fun,  cuts  off  pleasure.  But  Norma  Shearer  has  different  ideas.  Sleep  is  necessary  to  her  loveliness  and  well-being.  Even  when  there's  a  party  in  the  Shearer-Thalberg  home,  Norma  will  excuse  herself  before  the  hour  is  too  late,  go  off  to  bed.  To  bed  at  nine-thirty,  at  least  one  night  a  week,  might  be  a  wise  platform  for  every  wide-  awake girl.   •nPHE  curled  coiffure  still  continues  in  high  •*•  favor.  From  Hollywood,  down,  we  find  curls  and  bangs  still  very  popular.  But  there  is  one  severe  curl  complaint  from  the  average  girl.  The  coiffure  that,  the  night  before,  was  so  crisp,  so  compellingly  devastating,  the  next  morning  often  looks  like  a  pile  of  hay.  When  you  are  having  your  hair  done,  ask  your  hair-  dresser Jo  arrange  it  so  that  it  is  also  practical  for  day  and  have  him  show  you  just  how  to  <l<>  this  yourself.

The  centuries  have  not  changed  the  desire  of  every  woman  for  a  good  figure,  for  sparkling  eyes  and  a  lovely  complex-  ion. With  modern  fashions  as  exacting  as  they  are,  a  slender,  round  figure  is  almost  imperative.   These  three  secrets  of  charm  are  usu-  ally the  gifts  of  good  health.  So  when  reducing,  diet  and  exercise  should  be  watched  with  care.  Meals  should  con-  tain adequate  "bulk"  to  prevent  faulty  elimination — the  enemy  of  charm  and  good  complexions.   Fortunately,  a  delicious  cereal  pro-  vides this  needed  "bulk."  Laboratory  tests  prove  that  Kellogg's  All-Bran  supplies  "bulk" — as  well  as  vitamin  B  and  iron.  This  "bulk"  in  All-Bran  is  much  like  that  of  leafy  vegetables.   Two  tablespoonfuls  daily  will  over-  come most  types  of  faulty  elimination.  How  much  better  than  unpleasant  pat-  ent medicines — so  often  harmful  and  habit-forming.    Kellogg's  All-Bran  is  not  fattening.  It  helps  satisfy  hunger  without  adding  many  calories  to  the  diet.  Recommended  by  dietitians.

A  waggish  guest  caught  Ralph  and  Frank,  the  brothers  Morgan,  in  the  actual  throes  of  preparing  one  of  their  famous  suppers.     You  must  try  "Bolero" — the  Morgan  masterpiece,  hot  from  Spain!   Spanish  Accents  lhe  Menu    THERE'S  an  hour  'round  about  midnight  when  the  average  man  gets  a  hankering  for  a  good  snack  from  the  ice-box.  And  if  the  ice-box  doesn't  yield  anything,  fertile  masculine  imaginations  will!  Three  famous  mid-  night cooks  of  stage  and  screen  are  Alfred  Lunt,  and  the  two  Morgan  brothers,  Ralph  and  Frank.  The  Morgans  have  a  slight  edge  on  Lunt  because  they  cook  in  a  regular  brother  act  — and  their  prize  dish  is  Spanish.   If  you  daren't  eat  hearty  food  before  retiring,  you  can  use  the  Morgan  concoction,  "Bolero."  It  may  be  served  as  an  entree  at  luncheon,  dinner  or  supper.  Because  it  is  one. of  those  special  dishes  that  guests  remember  for  days,  it  should  be  a  must  on  your  menu.   Bolero   1  tamale  1  cup  fresh  corn  cut  from  cob   2  tomatoes  J^  cup  chopped  carrots  Chopped  celery  }/£  cup  chopped  raw  potatoes  1  egg  1  clove  of  garlic   Ripe  olives  J"2.cup  chopped  pimentos   3^  cup  grated  cheese   To  begin,  you  heat  the  tamale  and  mix  with  the  egg.  Then  prepare  a  casserole  or  baking  pan  with  a  cover,  by  buttering  it  liberally.  When  this  is  ready,  put  in  a  layer  of  corn — if  you  can't  get  the  corn  cut  from  the  cob,  canned  corn  will  do  just  as  well.  Next  comes  the  tamale  and  egg.  Then  a  layer  of  olives  and  chopped  pimentos  with  a  dash  of  the  garlic.  The  garlic,  of  course,  is  an  authentic  Spanish  touch  but  if  you  don't  like  the  flavor,  it  can  be  omitted  with-  out ruining  the  dish.  Over  this  layer,  distribute  the  chopped  vegetables.    Add  salt    Photoplay  Magazine  919  N.  Michigan  Ave.,  Chicago,  111.

Over  all  this,  sprinkle  the  grated  cheese.   Your  oven  should  be  heated  to  350  degrees  when  the  cas-  serole is  put  in.   Bake  the  contents  for  thirty  minutes,  if  you  have  used  the  above  recipe,  for  four  people.   For  eight,  double  the  ingredients  and  bake  for  forty  minutes.  Just  before  serving,  uncover  and  brown  the  cheese  under  the  broiler  flame.   The  Morgans  usually  counteract  the  hotness  of  this  dish  with  a  cool,  green  salad.   And  if  they  are  serving  it  for  luncheon  or  supper  they  precede  it  with  chilled  tomato  juice,  finishing  off  with  fresh  fruit  and  black  coffee.   Frank  makes  a  green  salad  with  lettuce,  endive  and  water-  cress topped  by  a  savory  French  dressing.  Here's  his  dressing  recipe:   French  Dressing   Rub  a  mixing  bowl  with  garlic.  Then  use  three  parts  olive  oil  to  one  part  vinegar.  Season  with  mustard,  salt  and  black  pepper  (freshly  ground,  if  you  have  a  grinder).  _  Add  a  little   sugar   and   paprika    to   taste.   Mix  and  chill  in  ice-box  before  pouring  over  the  salad.   Ralph  prefers  a  salad  of  cole  slaw  with  Spanish  dishes.  He  maintains  that  it  is  cool,  re-  freshing and  forms  a  pleasing  contrast  to  the  spicy  main  dish.   He  likes  it  prepared  with  a  sweet  and  sour  dressing  made  with  cream,  vinegar  and  sugar.  Or  with  a  French  dressing  to  which  has  been  added  a  hard-boiled  egg.   Frank  likes  his  slaw  mixed  with  chopped  carrots  and  raw-  spinach —  its  sounds  strange  but  is  delicious — trv  it.

"But  I  had  to  do  what  I  did — I  just  had  to."   There  was  no  question  of  money  involved.  Charlie  was  sitting  on  top  of  the  world  finan-  cially, making  a  salary  so  big  that  his  income  tax  alone  would  almost  pay  the  salary  of  the  new  president  of  the  United  States,  all  by  itself.   Only  two  months  ago  the  studio  took  up  the  last  option  on  Charlie's  contract,  and  he  was  all  set  for  another  year.  When  he  told  them  he  didn't  feel  like  taking  a  cut  in  salary,  that  was  all  there  was  to  it.   They  paid  him  the  increased  figure.  It  was  only  when  that  was  settled  that  he  asked  the  front  office  to  let  him  go — and  the  real  difficulty  stood  exposed.   "DAD  parts  were  the  reason  for  Charlie's  -'-'decision.  Just  that  and  nothing  more.  There  was  no  unpleasantness  of  any  sort.  When  he  left,  the  studio  officials  patted  him  on  the  shoulder,  told  him  they  hoped  he'd  soon  come  back  and  wished  him  well.  Hut  Charlie  wants  more  Ckicos,  and  he's  going  to  try  to  find  them  wherever  they  happen  to  be.   "I  knew  that  I  picked  possibly  the  worst  time  to  begin  free-lancing,"  he  said,  "and  Mr.  Sheehan  told  me  so  before  I  left.  But  I  couldn't  stand  that  colorless  diet  of  straight  Kading  men  any  longer.  How  can  you  play  characters  that  haven't  any  character?"  he  demanded,  spearing  a  sausage  a  hit  viciously.  "I  couldn't  go  on  playing  them  forever — I  couldn't  go  on  being  simply  the  unimportant  half  of  an  important  team,  and  that  was  what  I  was  getting  to  be."   As  he  spoke  his  voice  was  almost  pathetically  sincere,  and  a  couple  of  furrows  appeared  on  his  boyish  brow.  He  had  worried  about  it  endlessly,  he  said — you  could  see  that  it  meant  the  world  to  him.  Make  no  mistakes,  there  isn't  any  so-called  professional  jealousy  in-  volved. Charlie  isn't  jealous  of  the  good  parts  Janet  gets — he  wants  her  to  have  them,  always    will.  Charlie  was  always  ready  to  help  Janet  by  playing  cat  lo  her  Queen.   He  did  it  in  "Tess  of  the  Storm  Country,"  did  it  for  Janet  after  he  had  refused  to  do  it  for  the  studio.  His  part  held  nothing  for  him.  Janet  did  the  same  for  Charlie  in  "The  First  Year."  That  part  held  little  for  her,  but  Charlie  asked  her  to  go  on  for  him.   "Sure,  she  did,"  he  said  enthusiastically,  "although  she  knew  in  her  heart  she  shouldn't.  Janet  would  always  do  almost  anything  to  help  me."    That's  the  kind  of  team  they  were.   But  Charlie  doesn't  want  to  be  merely  a  foil  for  Janet  Gaynor  on  the  screen.  He  can't  see  why  there  couldn't  be  two  good  parts  in  the  picture — one  for  Janet  and  one  for  him.  He  would  have  been  perfectly  satisfied  with  that,  would  have  asked  nothing  more.  But  the  stories  were  picked  for  Janet,  and  his  [>art  usually  wasn't  so  good.  Then,  when  they  each  made  a  separate  picture,  Janet's  pictures  were  always  big  productions  while  Charlie  was  given  any  old  thing.  He  isn't  blaming  anybody  for  that,  except  possibly  himself.  Least  of  all  docs  he  blame  Janet.   "When  they  started  us  out  in  '7th  Heaven,' "  he  explained,  "they  gave  us  a  lot  to  live  up  to —  and  it  was  really  up  to  us.  Janet  realized  that  and  did  what  she  had  to  do  to  get  what  she  wanted.  I  didn't — I  just  kept  putting  it  off.  Janet  would  walk  into  the  front  office  and  insist  upon  having  the  parts  that  were  right  for  her  and  she  got  them.  They  built  her.  I  took  what  they  gave  me.  with  the  result  that  they  just  kept  me  around  the  lot  to  be  Janet's  leading  man.  But  we  began  as  stars  together,  and  that's  the  kind  of  stories  I  wanted."   Having  made  the  break,  Charlie  is  under  no  delusion  regarding  what  he  is  up  against.  He  has  not  grown  temperamental  or  gone  Holly-  wood. He  is  simply  making  a  deliberate  sacrifice  for  a  purpose — with  his  eyes  open.   "I  know  that  there  aren't  any  too  many  really  good  parts  to  be  had,"  he  said,  "and  I  know  that  even  of  those  there  are,  I  shan't  get  a  chance  at  most.     I  may  not  make  half  the    money  I  have  been  getting,  or  I  may  do  less  work  and  make  more — but  the  money  part  doesn't  matter.  I  do  know,  though,  that  I  shall  wait  for  the  kind  of  parts  I  want,  and  accept  nothing  else.  I  owe  that,  not  only  to  myself,  but  to  the  memory  of  Chico."   While  he  is  waiting  for  those  parts.  Charlie  is  improving  his  work  with  constant  study.  He  spends  as  much  time  with  teachers  of  various  sorts  as  he  formerly  spent  at  the  studio.   Asked  whether  he  would  return  to  the  Fox  lot  to  do  another  picture  with  Janet  if  a  suit-  able part  should  be  forthcoming,  Charlie  nodded  unhesitatingly.   "I'd  be  tickled  to  death,"  he  said,  " — after  I  do  a  few  good  parts  elsewhere  and  if  they  really  do  have  a  story  for  both  of  us.  Even  if  I  should  be  lucky  and  get  several  good  pictures  by  myself  before  one  came  with  Janet,  when  I  did  go  back,  there  wouldn't  be  any  difficulty  over  money.  I'd  rather  work  with  Janet  than  with  anyone  else  on  the  screen,  but  I  do  want  the  last  couple  to  be  forgotten  before  I  do  any  more  with  her.   """THERE'S  always  the  picture  around  the   -*-  corner,"  he  said,  a  bit  wistfully,  "and  that  was  what  I  was  waiting  for.  I  dreamed  of  the  big  picture  that  was  coming.  I  found  out  what  they  had  on  the  schedule  for  me,  and  that  picture  wasn't  there.  It  wasn't  easy  or  pleasant  to  do  as  I  did."   Voluntarily  giving  up  the  certainty  of  several  thousand  dollars  a  week  these  days  would  scarcely  be  easy  or  pleasant.  Leaving  little  Janet  on  that  big  lot,  severing  an  association  that  had  begun  in  the  clouds — no,  that  wouldn't  be  easy  or  pleasant,  either.  Chico  leaving,  with  Dimic  still  waiting  for  him  to  come  back —  just  as  she  did  in  "7th  Heaven."   "But,  you  sec" — and  here  Charlie  bit  down  hard  on  the  sausage — "I  just  have  to  have  some  real  parts  I  can  sink  my  teeth  into."   Chico,  you  will  remember,  was  really  a  most  remarkable  fellow!

Mustn't  forget  the  parties.  When  baby  is  ex-  actly three  months  old,  the  first  party  is  thrown.  Usually  a  small  family  group.  At  six  months,  a  little  larger  affair  is  given.  At  one  year,  a  pip.  A  jamboree,  no  less.  Limousines  drive  up.  Nurses  alight  with  baby  on  one  arm  and  a  suitcase  on  the  other.  Baby's  own  refresh-  ments, clean  clothing,  toys,  comforts,  sheets,  blankets,  waterbags,  bottles,  nipples  and  so  forth.   A  festive  table  is  set  with  solid  gold  appoint-  ments and  a  huge  cake  covered  with  pink  candies  in  the  middle.   So  two  dozen  babies  sit,  or  if  they  can't  sit,  they  lie,  and  eye  the  cake  they  may  not  eat,  making  occasional  snatches  at  each  other's  hair  while  nurses  wring  hands  and  mammas  in  the  next  room  play  bridge  and  argue  heatedly  whether  plain  old  castor  oil  is  better  than  the  new  mineral  oil.  Flashlights  from  twenty-  seven  newspaper  photographers  boom  and  flare,    babies  squeal,  the  castor  oilers  leave  in  a  rage  at  the  mineral  oilers  and  well — pardon  me,  I'm  exhausted.   Skeets  Gallagher,  Jr.,  exactly  three-and-one-  half  years  old,  is  Hollywood's  boredest  man-  about-town.   Skeets  has  attended  exactly  twenty-eight  parties,  knows  all  the  tricks  and  little  of  life's  thrills  are  left  for  Skeets.   They  even  give  up  cheerfully  and  gladly,  these  screen  lovers,  that  coveted  and  sought  after  fan  worship.  That  oh-my-gorgeous-hero  thing.  For  instance,  John  Boles  stood  at  the  corner  of  Hollywood  Boulevard  at  Highland  Avenue.  Nearby,  stood  several  beautiful  girls  frankly  and  openly  overcome  at  the  Boles  charm.  And  John  loved  it.  They  noticed  the  manly  physique  and  were  thrilled.  The  ravish-  ing mustache  and  were  overwhelmed.  The  blue  eyes  and  were  simply  limp.   And  just  then  the  car  for  which  John  had  evidently  been  waiting,  drew  up  to  the  curb,  and  like  a  flash  two  little  girls  from  the  car  were  on  him,  one  completely  wrapping  her  legs  about  his  middle,  the  other  slowly  strangling  him  by  the  necktie,  his  hat  flew  under  a  passing  truck,  his  trousers  were  slipping,  his  hair  was  on  end  while  the  two  girls  kept  squealing,  "daddy,  daddy,  daddy."   He  loved  it.  Ate  it  up.  Completely  forget-  ting the  worshipping  group  who  were  standing  with  mouths  open  and  eyes  popping.

If  the  wishes  of  admirers  come  true  his  movie  future  is  safe    When  Oklahoma  laws  kept  Rochelle  Hudson  off  the  stage  because  she  was  a  minor,  she  promptly  moved  to  Hollywood    LETTF^RS  poured  in  this  month  asking  about  Ralph  Bellamy.  "Don't  hold  out  on  us,  Mr.  Answer  Man,  tell  us  all  you  know  about  Ralph,"  is  the  general  plea.  So  I  surrender!    Now  listen:   Ralph  is  a  native  of  Chicago,  111.  He  was  born  there  on  June  17,  1904.  He  is  6  feet,  1J4  inches  tall;  weighs  178  and  has  light  brown  hair  and  blue  eyes.  Began  his  theatrical  career  when  he  ran  away  from  home  and  joined  a  Shakespearean  repertoire  company.  This  was  during  his  first  year  in  high  school.  After  that  came  work  in  stock  companies,where  he  was  everything  from  leading  man  to  chief  carpen-  ter. In  1930,  he  headed  for  New  York  deter-  mined to  crash  Broadway.  Later,  while  ap-  pearing on  Broadway  in  "Roadside,"  he  was  given  a  movie  contract  and  started  off  to  Hollywood.  He  made  his  talkie  debut  in  "The  Secret  Six,"  playing  the  role  of  a  reporter.  Since  then  he  has  appeared  in  "The  Magni-  ficent Lie,"  "West  of  Broadway,"  "Sur-  render," "Almost  Married."  "Disorderly  Con-  duct," "Forbidden,"  "Young  America,"  "The  Woman  in  Room  Thirteen,"  "Rebecca  of  Sunnybrook  Farm,"  "Airmail"  and  "Wild  Girl."  Quite  a  record  for  a  chap  who  has  only  been  in  Hollywood  since  1931.   Ralph  is  married  to  Katherine  Willard  from  the  stage.  His  chief  hobby  is  collecting  old  music  boxes.  He  has  about  fourteen  ancient  models  in  his  collection  now.  Has  a  weakness  for  neckties,  preferably  blue  ones.   Rochelle  Hudson,  the  girl  about  whom  readers  are  all  asking,  was  born  in  Claremore,  Okla.,  the  home-town  of  Will  Rogers,  eighteen  years  ago.  Her  theatrical  ambitions  began  at  the  age  of  four.  From  then  until  she  went  to  Hollywood,  she  appeared  I  efore  clubs,  societies  and  school  audiences.  Uer  first  screen  appearance  was  in  "Laugh  and  Get  Rich,"  which  was  followed  by  minor  roles  in  many  Radio  pictures.  In  "Fanny  Foley  Herself"  she  gave  an  exceptional  performance  and  won  the  feminine  lead  in  "Are  These  Our  Children?"   Rochelle  is  just  5  feet,  3  inches  tall,  but  re-   0i    member  she  still  has  time  to  grow  more  before  she  is  twenty-one.  She  tips  the  scale  at  105  pounds,  has  dark  brown  hair  and  grey  eyes.  Was  chosen  a  Wampas  Baby  Star  in  1931.  She  can  sing,  dance,  and  paints  beautifully.  And  I  don't  mean  her  face  either.  Has  a  Ford  roadster  which  she  drives  herself.  Speaks  French  fluently.  Her  next  picture  will  be  "The  Savage  Girl."   Louie,  Watertown,  Conn. — Mona  Maris  has  covered  some  territory  in  her  twenty-four  years  in  this  merry  world  of  ours.  Born  in  Buenos  Aires,  S.  A.,  educated  in  France,  entered  silent  pictures  in  London  in  1928  and  talkies  in  Hollywood  in  1929.  How's  that  for  traveling?  Mona  is  5  feet,  5  inches  tall;  weighs  115  pounds  and  has  dark  brown  hair  and  green  eyes.  She  speaks  Spanish,  French,  German  and  English.  Her  real  name  is  Emita  Capdevielle  and  she  is  still  single.  Her  next  picture  will  be  "Secrets"  with  Alary  Pickford.   Ed  Porterfield,  Los  Angeles,  Calif. —  'Member  Ed,  if  you're  the  winner  I  get  half.  Edmund  Lowe  was  a  newspaper  reporter  in  "Guilty  as  Hell."  He  doesn't  go  in  for  that  type  of  role  very  often.   Winifred  Klixe,  Richmond,  Mich. — Here  you  are,  Winnie.  Charles  Farrcll  was  born  in  Onset  Bay,  Mass.,  on  Aug.  9,  1902.  He  is  6  feet,  2  inches  tall;  weighs  170,  has  brown  hair  and  brown  eyes.  Virginia  Valli  has  answered  to  the  name  Mrs.Farreli  since  February  14, 1931.   D.  L.  W.,  Tenafly,  N.  J.— Dot,  the  chap  you  described  is  Alan  Mowbray,  and  that  English  accent  of  his  is  the  real  McCoy.  He's  a  native  of  dear  ol'  London,  born  there  on  August  18,  1896.  He  is  6  feet  tall,  weighs  158  and  has  light  brown  hair  and  grey-blue  eyes.  Is  married  and  has  one  daughter.  Appeared  on  the  stage  before  going  into  pictures  in  1930.   Film  Fans  Fifteen  Funsters,  Elyria,  Ohio.- — If  it  wouldn't  break  up  the  tongue-  twisting  rhythm  of  the  name  of  your  fraternity,    I'd  ask  what  does  a  tottering  chappie  have  to  do  to  become  a  member.  Jane  Novak's  last  picture  was  "Red  Skin,"  made  in  1928.  In  the  silent  version  of  "The  Bad  Man"  Holbrook  Blinn  played  the  role  of  Pancho  Lopez,  the  same  role  that  Walter  Huston  played  in  the  talkie  version.  Bill  Hart  was  only  married  once.  Thomas  Meighan's  latest  appearance  is  in  "Madison  Square  Garden."  For  the  rest  of  the  information,  girls,  send  me  a  stamped  en-  velope.   Constant  Reader. — Stop  the  disputing,  here's  the  information.  The  three  girls  who  appeared  at  the  switchboard  in  "The  Big  Broadcast"  (can  you  imagine  having  operators  hmmmmm  in  your  ear  like  that?)  were  not  the  Boswell  Sisters.  They  are  singers  known  to  radio  listeners  as  "Major,  Sharp  and  Minor."  Their  real  names  are  Josephine  Riley,  Anita  Nieto  and  Barbara  Johnstone.   Helena  Sechrest,  Lakeland,  Ky.  —  Your  friends  were  as  far  from  guessing  the  right  title  of  the  picture  as  I  am  from  Fu  Manchu — and  I  hope  that's  as  long  a  distance  as  I  think  it  is.  The  name  of  the  picture  was  "Such  Men  Are  Dangerous."  If  you  have  any  back  issues  of  Photoplay,  look  in  April  1930  and  you  can  see  the  review  and  show  it  to  your  friends.   Rufus  Prados,  Jr.,  New  Orleans,  La. —  Yes,  Rufie,  Dorothy  Wilson  has  real  long  hair.  Hope  she  doesn't  bob  it  before  this  reaches  print.  She  is  still  single,  so  you  won't  have  to  go  hide  in  a  monastery.  The  little  lady  was  born  in  Minneapolis,  Minn.,  on  November  14,  1909.  Is  5  feet,  \lA  inches  tall;  weighs  103  and  has  brown  hair  and  blue  eyes.  Her  latest  picture  is  "  Men  of  America."   Mrs.  E.  Hartman,  Bronx,  N.  Y. — You're  both  wrong.  Dick  Powell  has  real  auburn  hair,  but  it  photographs  dark.  Next  time  you  see  Jimmy  Cagney  or  Clara  Bow  on  the  screen  notice  how  dark  they  photograph,  yet  they  are  both  red-heads.

Char-lee  straightened  abruptly.  He  scowled  ferociously  at  the  helpless  p.m.   "Rubbish!"'  he  announced  crisply.  "What  do  you  mean?  Writing  such  confounded  non-  sense?"   "But,  it's  true!''  the  p.m.  declared.  "And,  anyhow,  I  didn't  write  it.    Frank  did."   Snatching  up  the  offending  page,  Char-lee  started  menacingly  toward  the  door.   "Frank?  Who's  Frank?  Where's  Frank?"  He  glared  at  the  page  and  flushed  uncomfort-  ably. "This  silly  thing  makes  me  look  like  a  darn  sissy  "'    I"    •T^HAT  was  my  introduction  to  Charles  *■  Laughton.  A  modest  man,  he  has  a  genuine  dislike  for  fanfare.  Is  a  difficult  subject  to  in-  terview, because  he  honestly  hates  to  talk  about  himself.   Paramount's  entire  personnel,  from  office  boy  to  president,  adores  him.   He  terrorizes  delighted  office  girls;  tucks  squealing  stenographers  under  his  arm  and  dashes  the  full  length  of  the  corridor  with  them;  generally  upsets  the  efficiency  of  the  whole  or-  ganization.   And  they  love  it.   When  Charlie  walks  in,  the  staff  automat-  ically declares  time  out.  They  crowd  around  and  listen  eagerly  while  he  relates,  with  exag-  gerated gestures,  various  amusing  incidents  of  the  day.  They  call  him  "Buster,"  and  are  re-  warded with  a  terrifying  scowl,  then  an  infec-  tious chuckle.   Laughton  is  an  actor  because  he  can't  help  it.   Years  ago,  a  chubby  youngster  sat  in  the  gallery  of  a  London  theater,  stifling,  with  dif-  ficulty, a  wild  desire  to  stop  the  show  and  shout  down  to  the  puppets  on  the  stage  that  they  were  all  wrong.  Real  people  didn't  act  that  way.  Stomping  around,  and  throwing  themselves  about.  His  own  technique  is  vastly  different  and  doubly  effective.  Extravagant  gesturing  is  no  part  of  him.   Instead,  he  stands  quietly,  fulfilling  even  the  most  difficult  emotional  reactions  with  the  mere  flick  of  an  eyelash,  a  slight  drooping  of  the  lips.     Subtle.    Acting  supreme.   In  the  short  time  he  has  been  with  us,  Laugh-  ton has  made  the  talkie  industry  sit  up  on  its  hind  legs,  roll  over  and  play  dead.  And  now,  with  the  public  clamoring  to  see  more,  he  merely  bows  graciously  and  announces  his  in-  tention of  returning  to  London.   Producers  toss  restlessly  in  their  downy  beds,  scheming  frantically  on  bigger  and  better  ideas  to  keep  this  new  gold  mine  from  walking  out  on  them.  Platinum-plated  contracts  are  being  held  temptingly  before  his  eyes.  But  Charlie  continues  to  shake  his  head  regretfully.   ''I'm  getting  stale,"  he  said  simply.  "They've  offered  me  more  money  than  I  ever  saw  before,  to  stay  here  and  carry  on.  But,  money  isn't  the  whole  thing,  if  a  fellow's  stale.  I've  been  working  pretty  consistently  during  the  seven  months  I've  been  here,  and  I'm  tired.     Empty.   T  WAXT  to  go  back  to  England  for  a  while.  •*•  The  change  will  do  me  good.  Set  me  up.  Then.  I  can  come  back,  go  to  work,  and  feel  that  I'm  really  giving  them  what  they're  pay-  ing for.    That  is,  if  they  still  want  me."   "They'll  want  you!"  I  hastened  to  assure  him.    He  seemed  rather  dubious.   "I've  been  warned  that  the  public  will  for-  get me  in  six  months,"  he  said.   Real  ability  is  not  forgotten  in  six  months.  I  told  him  so.

Photoplay  Magazine  for  February,  1933    KNOW   THIS   SECRET    Since  the  days  of  ancient  Egypt,  it  has  been  known  that  woman's  most  effective  beauty  is  in  her  eyes.  Not  their  color — not  their  size  or  shape  —  but  the  expression  of  which  they  are  capable  when  properly  made  up.  Clec  patra  knew  this  secret.  Stars  of  the  stage  and  screen  know  it  too.  Famous  beauties — includ'  ing  the  one  whose  picture  appears  above —  know  the  charm-value  of  the  "expression"  made  possible  by  dark,  long  appearing,  lux-  uriant lashes.

His  decision  marks  him  as  infinitely  wise  and  just.   Studio  "red  tape"  amazes  him.  When  they  planned  to  use  an  extra's  hands,  instead  of  his  own,  in  the  close-up  shots  in  "Devil  and  the  Deep,"  Laughton  protested.  His  hands  are  expressive,  a  definite  part  of  his  personality.   Why  substitute  other  hands  when  his  own  were  available?   They  told  him  why.  The  picture  had  fin-  ished shooting,  and  salary  complications  would  arise  if  they  used  him  in  the  close-up  retakes.  An  extra  man  would  cost  only  ten  dollars.   After  much  altercation,  Charlie  succeeded    in  convincing  them  that  the  money  was  a  minor  issue,  and  the  scenes  were  shot  with  his  hands  performing  the  necessary  duties — gratis.   At  the  door  of  the  publicity  office  we  said  goodbye.  A  stenographer  passed  us  and  said,  with  devilish  intent:  "Hullo,  Buster!"  She  knew  what  she  would  get  for  that,  and  Laugh-  ton  didn't  disappoint  her.   With  a  ferocious  scowl,  he  reached  out  and  caught  her  by  the  back  of  the  neck.   "  Char-lee ! "  she  squealed  merrily.   And,  as  Char-lee  swung  her  under  his  arm  and  started  down  the  corridor,  I  heard  for  the  last  time  that  delightfully  infectious  chuckle.

It  will  only  keep  you  awake.   Then  here  is  the  luncheon  menu  I  gave  Connie  :   Thick  vegetable  soup   Small  lamb  chop   Baked  potato  and  cold  butter   One  fresh  vegetable   Cup  custard  and  caramel — or  some  other   sauce  Glass  of  milk.   Right  after  lunch — she  usually  had  the  meal  served  in  her  dressing-room — she  rested  on  her  couch  for  fifteen  minutes.  You  girls  who  work  in  offices  can  do  the  same  thing.  Instead  of  loitering  over  the  luncheon  table  chatting  with  your  girl  friends,  go  to  the  rest  room  in  your  office  building  and  lie  down.   In  the  middle  of  the  afternoon  Connie  had  a  big  glass  of  tomato  juice.   For  dinner:   Ripe  olives   Celery  (wonderful  for  the  nerves)   Creamed  soup   Any  kind  of  meat,  broiled  or  roasted  (no   fried  meats)  Two  fresh  vegetables  Baked  potato   Avacado  salad  with  mayonnaise  Rice  pudding,  or  jello  or  fresh  fruits  Demi-tasse   You  shouldn't  need  me  to  tell  you  this,  but  some  of  you  never  seem  to  realize  that  the  hours  before  midnight  are  the  hours  of  real  beauty  sleep.  No  matter  where  Connie  Bennett  was,  no  matter  what  grand  party  she  attended,  she  always,  while  she  was  under  my  care,  came  home  at  nine  o'clock  to  be  ready  for  my  treatment — the  gentle  massage  with  the  cocoa  oil.  And  she  got  right  into  bed,  too.  She  obeyed  me  exactly  and  I  certainly  think  that  when  a  girl  as  attractive  as  Connie  and  a  girl  who  loves  parties  as  well  as  she  does,  can  do  that,  you  can.   I  made  her  take  plenty  of  breathing  exer-  cises— standing  in  front  of  an  open  window  and  inhaling  slowly,  raising  the  arms  at  right  angles  to  the  body  and  then  exhaling  and  lowering  the  arms.  I  told  her  to  sing— that's  a  wonderful  figure  developer.  She  really  has  a  lovely  voice  — low  and  small,  but  appealing.   And  I  made  her  laugh — laugh  heartily,  too —  for  that's  a  swell  way  to  put  on  weight.  "For-  get you  are  a  lady,  Connie,"  I  told  her,  "and  let  out  a  big  hearty  laugh  when  something  strikes  you  funny."   She  took  lukewarm  showers  after  which  she  rubbed  her  body  with  a  rough  towel  for  ten  minutes.   Just  before  she  went  to  sleep  at  night  she  had  a  glass  of  grapefruit  juice.  This  is  a  real  sleep-  ing medicine.  Why  orange  juice  is  a  stimulant  and  grapefruit  juice  a  sedative,  I  don't  know —  but  I  do  know  it's  the  truth.   So  much  for  Connie's  routine — a  really  very-  simple  one  that  all  girls  can  do.    Connie  did  exactly  as  I  told  her  to,  for  she  is  a  smart  enough  business  woman  to  know  that  without  looks  and  a  lovely  figure,  she  could  never  be  a  great  star,  and  from  her  you  may  take  a  lesson  in  obedience.  But  Connie  had  a  hard  time  conquering  her  nerves.  She  was  easily  upset.  When  she  came  home  at  night  and  her  German  maid  had  gotten  the  telephone  messages  that  came  during  the  day  wrong,  she  would  fly  off  the  handle.  She  called  the  girl  "Dumb  Dora,"  and  yet  Dora  was  crazy  about  Connie  and  never  took  these  outbursts  seriously.   Another  thing  that  always  upset  Connie  was  when  she  got  so  many  letters  asking  her  for  help.  She  wanted  to  help  everybody  and  knew  she  couldn't  and  it  worried  her.   "Forget  it,"  I  used  to  tell  her.  "Your  worry  should  be  to  restore  your  looks."   Connie  loved  being  the  big  shot  at  the  studio  and  was  very  ambitious.  She  was  a  tireless  worker.  Once  I  watched  "the  rushes,"  scents  of  herself  that  had  been  taken  the  day  before,  with  her.  She  looked  at  them  over  and  over  again,  tirelessly  watching  her  every  movement.   As  I  have  said,  she  was  really  sick  and  run  down  when  she  first  came  to  me.  After  the  first  week  she  said  to  me  one  night,  "Look —  I'm  building  up  and  I'm  feeling  so  much  better."   She  gained,  under  my  treatment,  fifteen  pounds  in  one  month,  and  her  pep  came  back.   Connie  is  like  the  great  French  actresses.  She  loves  a  political  intrigue  and  likes  to  have  things  revolve  around  her.  Of  course,  you  know  about  the  feud  that  existed  between  her  and  Gloria  Swanson.  Poor  Joe  Kennedy — he  had  to  settle  many  difficulties,  yet  when  Connie  and  Gloria  met  they  were  very  polite  to  each  other — too  polite  to  be  natural,  I  always  thought.  Connie  often  asked  me  if  I  thought  Gloria  was  beautiful.   /"'ONNIE  has  many  typically  European  ideas.  ^-'She  loves  parties  and  that's  why  I  give  her  so  much  credit  for  coming  home  every  night  at  nine.  When  she  wasn't  working  she  liked  to  play  a  Little  tennis  and  golf  but  her  chief  sport  was  sitting  around  talking.  Connie  loves  to  talk.  She  was  also  crazy  about  tango  records  and  she  liked  to  dance.   Connie  Bennett  is  certainly  a  strong  char-  acter. I  remember  that  her  sister  Joan  used  to  call  her  often  while  I  was  there  and  Connie  used  to  give  Joan  advice.  It  was  darn  good  advice,  too.  One  night  Joan  had  asked  her  something  and  Connie  said,  "Now  don't  cry,  Joan,  no  man  would  ever  make  a  sap  out  of  me,  I  can  tell  you."  Connie  always  had  plenty  of  spunk  and  courage  and  she  was  very  apprecia-  tive of  everything  I  did  for  her.   "You  give  people  life,"  she  said  to  me  one  day.  "You  give  people  confidence  in  them-  selves again."

You're  probably  skinny  all  over  and  need  to  build  yourself  up  generally.  That  means  you  should  go  through  the  routine  I've  given  in  my  article  this  month.  Do  what  I  told  Connie  Bennett  to  do  for  a  while  and  gain  fifteen  pounds  in  one  month.  Then  spend  special  care  on  your  hands.

Long  Neck  Dear  Sylvia:   What  should  I  do  for  a  long  neck?   H.  H.  K.,  Jackson  Heights,  N.  V.   Be  thankful  you've  got  a  long  neck  and  that  your  head  isn't  slammed  down  on  your  shoulders  like  those  fat  women  I  rave  against.  Look  at  the  actresses — all  the  great  ones  have  long  necks.  It's  a  sign  of  beauty.  Stop  com-  plaining about  something  that  a  lot  of  people  wish  they  had.   There — those  are  the  only  questions  I  have  time  to  answer  now.  But  come  on  you  girls —  ask  me  about  what's  bothering  you.

The  Man  Who  Can't  Talk   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  49  ]    sister's  friend  was  tingling  with  excitement.  She  started  to  chatter.  She  found  her  words  echoing  back  as  from  a  granite  mountain.  Warren  spoke  hardly  a  word,  after  acknowledg-  ing the  introduction,  until  the  girls  were  ready  to  leave.  Then  he  announced,  "I'll  drive  you  to  the  station."  And  at  the  station,  "I'm  going  back  to  New  York  with  you."   "But  you  haven't  been  given  leave!"  was  his  sister's  astonished  exclamation.   "I'm  going."   They  all  dined  together.  The  two  girls  talked.  But  right  in  the  middle  of  dinner  Warren  leaned  over  and  kissed  the  neck  of  the  beautiful  young  woman  sitting  beside  him.  The  next  day,  sister's  chum  received  a  special  delivery  letter  from  Warren.  And  the  next  day,  another.  She  didn't  see  him  often,  but  each  day  brought  one  of  his  long,  beautiful  letters.   For  the  man  who  couldn't  talk,  could  write.  What  a  woman  expects  her  loved  one  to  say  with  his  lips  under  the  moon  and  the  stars,  Warren  William  could  say  with  his  pen  without  moonlight  or  starry  skies.  He  didn't  need  Nature's  romantic  aids  to  put  just  the  right  thoughts  into  the  right  words — in  letters.   Helen  offers  some  facts  which  may  explain  this.  Warren  comes  from  a  line  of  bankers.  His  real  name  is  Warren  William  Krech,  of  the  banking  house  of  Krech,  but  he  dropped  the  surname  for  professional  reasons.  Perhaps  his  ancestry  accounts  for  his  conversational  silence,  since  almost  all  bankers  seem  to  have  a  one-word  vocabulary  consisting  of  "no."   But  as  it  happened  this  twig  of  the  family  tree  possessed  the  non-banking  ability  to  write  letters  that  charm.  When  he  went  overseas,  the  letters  continued.  After  the  armistice,  he  remained  in  Europe  to  entertain  the  doughboys  who    were    still   in    service    there.

The  sub-  merged self  which  went  into  his  letters  also  ex-  pressed itself  in  eloquent  glory  when  he  was  playing  that  he  was  some  other  fellow.   ""THEN  Warren  came  home.  The  actors'  ■*-  strike  was  on,  so  times  were  tough  even  for  an  actor  of  his  ability.  Work  came  eventually,  as  it  always  does  to  those  for  whom  Fate  has  decreed  fame  from  the  beginning.   On  the  road  with  "I  Love  You"  in  the  role  Richard  Dix  played  on  Broadway.  Fifty  weeks  which  produced  more  letters.  It's  per-  fectly obvious  why  the  William  family  must  always  live  in  a  house  with  a  garret.   In  "Mrs.  Jimmy  Thompson"  he  was  a  pickle  salesman;  a  dignified  lawyer  in  "We  Girls";  with  Ruth  Chatterton  in  "La  Tendresse,"  a  straight  leading  man.  Pictures,  too — a  half-  wit carpenter  with  whiskers  is  one  product  of  the  silent  days.  Mrs.  William  explains  that  when  she  married  him  in  1923,  she  felt  an  urge  far  greater  than  love — a  compelling  need  that  seemed  to  draw  her — a  feeling  that  he  was  going  to  do  big  things  and  that  she  could  and  must  find  her  happiness  helping  him.   There  was  a  long  list  of  plays  after  they  were  married.  "Twelve  Miles  Out,"  "Let  Us  Be  Gay" — it  would  take  a  page  to  print  them.  Successes  and  flops,  about  equally  divided.   Warren  didn't  want  to  play  in  "The  Vinegar  Tree."  But  work  was  scarce — you  know  what  success  it  won.  Mary  Boland  and  Warren  William.  It  brought  him  into  the  talkies.  He  finished  his  engagement  in  it  on  a  Thursday  night,  hopped  a  plane  and  started  work  the    next  Monday  morning  with  Dolores  Costello  in  her  last  screen  appearance,  "Expensive  Women."   Whereupon  Hollywood  received  its  star  who  can't  talk — except  for  strictly  professional  pur-  poses on  the  screen.  And  his  studio  fell  heir  to  a  problem.  Movie-goers  want  to  know  who's  who  and  what's  what  about  rising  stars.  The  movie  capital  is  a  Babel  of  publicity — actors  and  actresses  and  their  press-agents — so  even  a  shrinking  violet's  praises  have  to  be  shouted  in  self-defense.  A  star's  public  has  a  right  to  know  about  him.  But  how  can  they  if  their  favorite  is  possessed  by  an  overpowering  shy-  ness that  prevents  him  talking  to  reporters  even  when  they  seek  him  out?   They  wanted  him  to  appear  at  the  electrical  parade  in  honor  of  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt's  visit.  He  said,  "No."  They  thought  he  was  being  temperamental.  He  wasn't.  He'd  heard  that  the  stars  would  have  to  say  "a  few  words"  into  the  microphone.  He  did  go,  finally — and  said,  "Good  evening."   T_TE  loves  the  sea.  That  comes  from  his  wish  *-  -Mo  avoid  people.  He  has  owned  three  yachts,  and  he's  going  to  buy  one  soon  for  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Then  he'll  go  away  and  com-  mune with  the  waves  that  don't  talk  to  him  or  expect  him  to  talk  back — which  is  fine  for  Warren,  but  not  so  helpful  to  his  public.   It  does  seem  there's  only  one  thing  for  Warren  William  to  do,  while  he's  on  land  and  making  pictures,  if  he's  to  be  understood  by  his  professional  associates — producers,  directors,  fellow  players,  as  well  as  interviewers  and  ad-  mirers.   He  must  write  all  Hollywood  and  all  fandom  a  stream  of  his  inimitable  letters.

"Then,"  I  countered,  "they  are  thinking  that  you  fell  in  love  with  Jeanette  MacDonald  and  no  man's  life  could  hold  two  loves  at  once,  especially  if  one  of  the  ladies  happens  to  be  his  wife. "   "Xo,  really,  they  are  not  saying  zat,  are  they?"   "pOR  the  first  time  since  we  began  talking  I  •*-  thought  I  detected  a  bright  little  light  in  the  Chevalier  eyes,  a  light  which  any  actor  could  keep  controlled  like  a  business  man  can  put  on  a  poker  face.   "It  has  been  rumored,"  I  assured  him.  He  threw  up  his  hands  then  and  a  little  frown  puckered  his  brow.  He  looked  exactly  like  a  small  boy  who's  been  suddenly  called  upon  by  his  teacher  and  doesn't  know  the  answer.   "Eet  ees  an  injustice  to  'Jonette,'  "  he  said,  after  a  moment.  "She  is  a  fine  actress  and  we  have  worked  together  harmoniously  in  many  pictures.  But  her  fiance,  Bob  Ritchie,  was  in  zee  studio  every  moment  of  our  love  scenes  together.  Please  say  to  those  who  believe  thees  story  that  I  am  not  in  love  with  'Jonette,'  I  have  never  been  in  love  with  her.  I  have  no  plans  for  another  marriage  and  thees  vow  will  hold  good  for  a  very  long  time,  if  not  forever."   "Then  what?"  I  entreated.  "Won't  you  come  through  and  tell  just  what  was  wrong  with  your  marriage?"   Maurice's  expression  dropped  to  a  noticeable  sadness  and  he  sat  meditating  for  quite  a  while.  Suddenly,  he  looked  up  and  his  eyes  lighted  on  the  pedestrians  in  the  street  below.   "Do  you  see  those  women  hurrying  home?"  he  asked  quietly.    I  nodded.   I  stood  at  the  window  beside  him,  studying    the  six  o'clock  throng  moving  briskly  through  the  twilighted,  winter  evening  to  the  subways  and  street  cars  which  would  take  them  home;  home  to  small  apartments  and  big  houses  dotted  throughout  the  city  and  suburbs,  many  of  them  to  join  husbands  after  a  day  at  theoffice  or  shop.  Some  of  these  women  would  be  bored  all  evening,  some  of  them  would  be  secretly  railing  at  their  fate,  some  of  them  would  sit  quietly  listening  to  husbands  relate  their  clever  business  coups,  all  the  while,  perhaps,  think-  ing of  someone  else.   "I  don't  know,"  I  admitted,  "perhaps  four  out  of  every  seven  are  happy  and  the  other  three  are  miserable.  Our  American  divorce  rate  is  three  out  of  every  seven  marriages,  I  believe."   "And  what  can  they  do  about  it?"  Maurice  asked,  spiritedly.  Before  I  thought  of  an  answer,  he  went  on:   "Nothing — usually!  If  they're  rich — or  if  the  husband  can  make  enough  money  to  do  the  elegant  thing— the  chivalrous  thing — in  the  gentlemanly  manner,  he  will  release  the  wife  on  whose  nerves  he  is  constantly  tread-  ing." He  had  said  enough  now  to  make  him  want  to  go  on  and  explain.   "  A /f  ARRIED  people  who  are  not  suited  to  ■" -*-each  other's  temperament  get  horribly  on  each  other's  nerves.  Eet  starts  as  small  argu-  ments— over  nothing.  The  arguments  become  more  frequent.  Suddenly,  you  wake  up  to  the  realization  that  you  are  both  quarreling  over  trivial  things  and  that  these  things  become  tremendous  issues.   "Anyone  who  has  gone  through  the  horror  of  incompatibility  will  understand  what  I  mean.  Two  people,  who,  through  days  of  bickering,  petty  quarreling,  magnifying  issues  which  normally  could  be  laughed  off,  gradually  strangle  the  love  that  once  was  theirs.   "And  then,  too  late,  they  discover  that  in    Photoplay  Magazine  for  February,  1933    99    place  of  the  lovely,  fragile  emotion  which  they  held  in  their  hearts  for  each  other,  there  is  nothing  left  but  a  void;  a  constant  dread  of  a  new  encounter  with  a  foolish  triviality  only  to  bring  out  again  that  "ole  devil"  incompatibility.   "Thees  ees  what  happened  to  us — to  Yvonne  and  to  me — after  seven  years  of  marriage. "   I  looked  at  Chevalier  and  he  had  suddenly  grown  a  bit  haggard  in  those  boyish  lines  around  his  mouth.  There  was  no  actor  play  in  what  I  saw  in  his  eyes  that  day.  He  seemed  so  helpless,  so  lonely,  so  completely  stripped  of  all  sham.   I  remember  Maurice's  parting  words  as  we  said  goodbye  that  evening.  He  said:  "If  you  must  tell  all  this,  please  tell  those  who  have  wanted  to  know  that  I  have  been  a  gentleman  all  the  way  through  this  divorce,  I  have  executed  every  detail  of  our  arrangement  in  the  elegant,  Continental  manner.  And  no  matter  how  long  we  live  nor  how  far  apart  we  may  be,  I  shall  always  hope  Yvonne  and  I  can  be  good  friends!"    [  CONTINl^D  FROM  PAGE  53  ]   into  the  world,  so  when  a  thing  is  as  completely  pigeon-holed  and  settled  as  that  you  rarely  bring  the  matter  up  for  discussion.   Why  this  subject  of  parenthood  should  be  too  sacred  to  permit  of  any  new  ideas  towards  perfecting  it,  I  have  never  understood,  but  let  a  voice  be  raised  in  dissent,  let  a  brave  soul  agree  with  Emil  Ludwig,  that  only  weak  and  apathetic  natures  see  in  their  children  the  highest  consummation  of  their  lives,  and  they  will  call  forth  such  a  diatribe  from  the  public  press  as  would  scorch  them  alive.   Personally,  a  controversy  delights  me  and  one  of  these  days  I'm  going  to  start  one  on  that  subject.   There  was  no  need  to  ask  young  Doug  here  just  where  his  father  stood  with  him.  I  had  seen  them  come  down  the  stairway  with  their  arms  around  each  others  shoulders  and  laugh-  ing like  a  couple  of  freshmen  on  a  lark.  But  I  turned  to  him  anyway  with  the  question.   "What  do  you  think  of  your  father,  Doug?"   He  shot  a  quick  look  at  me,  his  eyes  laugh-  ing. He  thought  I  was  framing  some  gag  and  he  was  not  going  to  be  caught  napping.   "No  wisecrack,"  I  said.    "I'm  serious."   *L_TIS  face  sobered  instantly  and  he  answered,  -*■  -*-"He's  the  best  friend  I'll  ever  have.  You  know  we've  never  been  a  conventional  father  and  son."   "What  do  you  mean  by  conventional  father  and  son?"  I  demanded.   "Oh,  the  sort  that  treats  his  offspring  as  a  sounding  board  for  his  own  egoism.  Herman  let  me  think  for  myself  but  we  did  everything  together. "   I  turned  to  Douglas  again,  hoping  the  chat-  ter down  the  long  table  would  continue  so  we  could  talk  uninterrupted.   "Was  this  a  theory  of  yours  as  to  how  chil-  dren should  be  brought  up?"   "Oh  Lord,  no,"  he  answered.  "No  theory,  I  just  wanted  'George'  to  express  himself,  not  me.  Don't  misunderstand  me.  I  think  a  lot  of  youngsters  who  express  themselves  are  simply  being  ill-mannered.  Like  the  little  boy  who  was  at  a  party  with  his  mother  and  sud-  denly yelled,  'Mother  I  heard  what  you  said.  Mother  you  are  a  fool.'  At  which  his  mother  smiled  charmingly  and  explained,  'You  see  my  son  has  been  brought  up  to  express  his  mind  without  fear.'   "George's  mother  and  I  taught  him  good  manners  and  let  him  grow."   My  mind  turned  back  to  the  first  time  I  ever  saw  young  Doug.  He  was  living  with  his  mother  at  the  Hollywood  Hotel.  He  must  have  been  all  of  eight  years  old.   The  famous  old  hostelry  on  Hollywood  Bou-    Women  revolt   against  washing  dirty  handkerchiefs!    KLEENEX   brings  release  from  this  hated  task!

NOTOX   COLORS  HAIR  INSIDE  WHERE     NATURE     DOES    levard  sheltered  under  its  tile  roof  all  the  famous  names  of  the  screen  at  one  time  or  an-  other, and  its  Thursday  night  dances,  held  in  the  lobby  of  the  hotel,  were  as  informal  and  gay  as  moonlight  hayrides.   Everyone  of  note  in  the  film  world  attended  those  weekly  affairs.   I  have  a  mental  picture  of  young  Doug,  sit-  ting on  the  broad  stairway  that  led  into  the  lobby,  dressed  in  a  magnificent  cowboy  outfit;  metal-studded  belt,  lasso,  longhaired  chaps  and  all.   Undoubtedly,  he  had  been  permitted  to  wear  this  costume  as  a  pacifier  for  being  too  young  to  join  the  dancers.   T_JE  would  sit  there  with  his  elbows  on  his  *•  -Htnees,  chin  cupped  in  his  hands  and  watch  the  people  making  merry,  and,  in  all  proba-  bility, dreaming  of  the  time  when  he  would  outride  Tom  Mix  and  capture  the  bandit,  or  else  lick  big  Bill  Farnum  in  a  hand-to-hand  combat.   It  was  pretty  hard  to  reconcile  that  young-  ster in  chaps  dreaming  on  the  stairway  with  the  muscular,  bronzed  young  man  impeccably  dressed  in  evening  attire,  sitting  on  my  right.  Scarcely  more  than  fourteen  years  could  have  passed  and  half  of  those  years  covered  the  period  of  adolescence;  yet  here  was  a  fellow  who  had  already  won  distinction  as  a  writer,  artist,  sculptor  and  actor,  any  one  of  which  is  an  accomplishment.   Time  alone  does  not  account  for  such  amaz-  ing development.  He  is  that  rare  person  pos-  sessing not  only  many  talents  but  also  the  talent  to  make  use  of  them,  and  say  what  you  will.  the  method  of  his  bringing  up  accounts  for  much  of  it.   Somewhere  along  the  line,  probably  from  observing  what  went  on  around  him,  young  Doug  must  have  learned  that  it  is  fatal  to  be  average.   He'll  never  be  that.  He  does  not  follow  the  crowd.   His  short  articles  on  other  film  luminaries  are  unique  and  utterly  delightful,  principally  because  of  his  ability  to  pin  down  in  a  single  paragraph  their  various  idiosyncrasies.   He  is  audacious.  Will  use  an  indelicate  word  now  and  then  but  never  infringes  on  the  nicer  rules  of  human  etiquette.   "How  did  you  learn  to  write  at  your  early  age?"  I  asked  him.  "Don't  you  know  that  it  is  an  American  tradition  that  one  must  serve  at  many  things  before  becomin,'  a  good  writer?"   "Well,  you  see,"  he  answered,  "I  secured  the  waste-paper  basket  concessions  at  all  the  big  clubs  and  hotels  and  from  these  I  pilfered  enough  cast-off  manuscripts  to  learn  about  life—."   "  Stop  it, "  I  cried.  "  If  you  won't  be  serious  for  a  second  I'll  leave  you  to  play  with  your  silver  for  awhile. "   And  now  young  Doug  will  want  to  murder  me  for  what  I  am  going  to  tell  you.   At  my  first  meeting  with  him  after  he  grew  up,  I  couldn't  observe  him  without  confusion.  Silly  statement  that,  but  true.  He  seemed  more  sophisticated  than  anyone  I  had  ever  known  and  the  contradiction  between  his  youthful  years  and  that  state  of  affairs  sort  of  embarrassed  me.  Then  I  saw  him  again  and  came  to  a  conclusion.   His  sophistication  is  simulated.  It's  part  of  a  defense.   \  ^ANY  people  think  on  first  meeting  with  ■'■'■'■him  that  he  is  high-hat.  Even  Joan  had  that  impression  before  they  really  knew  each  other.  That's  part  of  the  defense,  too.  De-  fense against  what,  you  ask?   He  hates  to  be  so  young.   His  mind  and  abilities  are  far  ahead  of  his  years,  and  I'm  sure  he  is  always  afraid  that  strangers  will  discover  how  youthful  he  is  and  treat  him  as  such.   He  will  do  anything,  try  anything,  wants  every  experience  of  life,  and  is  eager  and  en-  thusiastic when  once  you  break  down  that  world-wise  exterior,  which  proves  his  is  not  a  renl  sophistication.     Sophisticates  are  usually    blase,  particularly  about  the  thrills  that  life  has  to  offer.   Recently  a  famous  educator,  Dr.  Schmul-  hausen,  lectured  on  psychoanalytical  matters,  in  Los  Angeles.  Men  like  Upton  Sinclair,  Judge  Ben  Lindsey  and  others  were  on  the  re-  ception committee  in  honor  of  the  gentleman,  but  young  Doug  was  head  of  the  committee  and  master  of  ceremonies.   Rather  remarkable  company  for  a  lad  in  his  early  twenties.   ""THAT  night,  during  dinner,  I  noticed  that  -1-  Douglas  enjoyed  a  glass  of  wine  with  his  food,  and  commented  on  it,  knowing  that  in  former  years  he  never  drank  anything  stronger  than  tea.   "That's  true, "  he  answered.  "I  never  tasted  alcohol  in  my  life  until  about  five  years  ago.  But  George  liked  a  glass  now  and  then  so  I  got  to  taking  one  with  him. "  Then  he  added  smilingly,  "You  know  a  glass  of  beer  or  wine  serves  to  increase  the  feeling  that  life  is  a  very  agreeable  thing. "   If  a  few  short  years  have  developed  young  Doug  into  a  personage,  the  last  three  or  four  have  done  something  fine  for  Douglas  also.   He  is  still  forceful,  dynamic,  but  he  has  grown  much  warmer,  more  human.  He  has  learned  something  that  few  people  ever  know —  the  great  art  of  listening,  of  seeming  to  be  com-  pletely absorbed  in  what  is  being  said  at  the  moment.   I  have  only  known  half  a  dozen  people  who  could  listen.  So  few  realize  that  flashes  of  silence  improve  any  conversation.   Douglas'  attitude  toward  young  Doug  nar-  rows to  a  very  thin  line,  the  difference  in  their  ages,  the  late  forties  and  the  early  twenties.   father  and  son  meet  and  play  golf,  shake  up  something  hidden  in  the  locker,  indulge  in  a  few  cigarettes  and  later,  perhaps,  sit  together  in  the  front  row  of  the  hottest  show  in  town.   I  feel  the  inner  man  in  Douglas  Fairbanks  has  captured  something  of  priceless  value  these  last  few  years.  Perhaps  the  leisure  he  has  taken  for  himself  has  done  it.  Most  people  work  and  live  too  fast  to  think,  and  there  is  no  growth  without  thought.   The  story  comes  to  mind  that  on  Douglas'  last  birthday  someone  gave  him  a  party  and  during  the  course  of  dinner  Mary  was  asked  how  old  Doug  was.   She  replied,  "He's  twenty-one  going  on  twenty  "   Douglas  responded  by  looking  fondly  at  her  and  answering,  "That's  right  Mary — a  man  is  old  only  when  his  imagination  becomes  so  feeble  he  can  no  longer  fancy  himself  in  love.  "   As  this  story  is  written,  I  learn  that  young  Doug  is  busier  than  an  orchestra  following  a  newsreel.  He  is  working  on  a  picture  called  "Sucker,"  is  writing  a  book  for  which  he  is  also  making  the  drawings,  and  has  a  play  in  mind  which  he  hopes  to  get  time  to  put  on  paper.   T  GOT  to  wondering  if  there  was  no  limit  to  -*-  his  abilities  and  just  what  heights  he  would  reach  within  the  next  ten  years,  so  I  wired  him  and  asked  what  he  hoped  to  be  doing  ten  years  from  now.   His  answer  is  typical:   "First  I  hope  to  be  situated  so  that  in  case  I  want  to  go  to  the  U.  S.  C. — Notre  Dame  foot-  ball game  I  can  do  so  without  having  to  work  nights  to  make  up  for  it.  After  that,  all  I  can  say  is  ten  years  is  a  long  time.  No  man  can  look  ahead  that  far  because  too  much  beyond  the  horizon  obscures  his  view.  The  reason  you  make  plans  is  so  you  can  change  them.  Nobody  hoping  to  progress  will  hold  unswerv-  ingly to  a  fixed  course.  It  may  be  wise  to  take  a  different  road  through  a  new  field  if  your  pathway  is  hopelessly  obstructed,  but  only  prophets  with  long  grey  beards  make  predic-  tions, and  beards  are  out  of  style  just  now.  If  a  fellow  can  bring  to  himself  some  measure  oi  success  in  any  field,  he  should  feel  satisfied."   Well,  whatever  you  do  Doug,  Jr.,  your  big  gest  success  will  have  been  making  good  with  "Herman."

Or  I've  done  stunts  all  day  and  am  badly  bruised  up.  Perhaps  they  rushed  us  to  death  to  get  a  lot  of  shots  before  sun-  down, and  I'm  fit  to  be  tied.  For  the  moment.  they  can  take  the  whole  picture  business  and  toss  it  in  the  Los  Angeles  river.  I  do  a  rave,  although  ordinarily  I'm  not  much  of  a  raver.   Does  Clara  blow  up  because  I  bring  my  troubles  home  and  let  off  a  little  steam?  Xot  that  girl.  She  knows  all  about  it.  She  stays  very  calm,  has  dinner  sent  up  to  our  room  where  we  can  dine  in  cozy  privacy,  and  talks  it  over  with  me.  In  no  time  at  all.  everything  is  smoothed  over  and  cooled  off.  She  under-  stands all  about  it.  I  don't  have  to  tell  her  just  what  happened,  in  detail.  Half  the  time,  you  can't  put  it  in  words.  But  she  has  had  identical  experiences  herself.  Even  if  she  has  troubles  of  her  own  at  the  time,  she  doesn't  mention  them  until  she  has  me  "yessed"'  and  happy.  Of  course,  she  "yesses"  me.  And,  of  course,  I  love  it.   HpHE  next  morning,  when  I  go  to  work,  all  is  -*-  serene.  Generally  I  have  completely  for-  gotten whatever  it  was  that  sent  me  home  grumbling.  "They  can  have  their  picture  busi-  ness— I'll  take  horses."   Clara  is  domestic.  She  likes  to  see  the  house  looking  nice  and  orderly,  but  always  livable.  Only  she  has  that  sixth  sense,  that  sort  of  God-given  instinct,  for  keeping  a  man  com-  fortable. Lots  of  good  housewives  never  learn  it.  If  I  kick  off  my  boots  and  chaps  wherever  I  happen  to  be,  or  set  up  a  rubbing-table  in  the  parlor,  Clara  figures  that  probably  the  world  won't  come  to  an  end — the  damage  isn't  very  serious,  and  maybe  it  will  all  come  out  in  the  wash,  anyway.  You  see,  I  live  there  too.  She  knows  whatever  she  wants  to  do  will  be  okay  with  me.   I  am  no  hen-pecked  husband.  Clara  lets  me  think  I'm  the  head  of  our  house,  and  that's  more  than  lots  of  men  can  say.  She  asks  my  advice  about  everything.  She  wouldn't  think  of  making  an  investment  or  signing  a  contract  without  consulting  me.  And  she  won't  enter  into  any  long  contracts,  for  that  would  keep  us  from  going  to  the  ranch  when  we  want  to,  or  might  separate  us  for  weeks  at  a  time.   My  wife  makes  more  decisions  on  my  busi-  ness affairs  than  her  own.  She  will  put  up  a  better  fight  for  me  than  I  can.  She  intercedes  on  contracts  and  studio  matters  and  gets  more  for  me  than  I  would  think  of  asking.  I  can  do  the  same  for  her.  If  you  love  someone,  you  can  promote  that  person's  interests  better  than  your  own.   We  always  try  to  help  each  other.  She  has  more  faith  in  me  than  I  have.  She  likes  my  friends  and  I  like  hers.  'We  never  criticize  them.

We  do  not  allow  them  to  advise  us  in  our  domestic  relations  or  business  matters.  That  leads  to  misunder-  standings, and  we  prefer  to  make  our  own  de-  cisions, even  if  they  are  wrong  sometimes.   TXTE  have  absolute  faith  in  each  other.  We  *»  do  not  attempt  to  trap  each  other  with  questions  as  I  have  seen  so  many  young  mar-  ried people  do.  That's  fatal.  It  means  there  is  suspicion  some  place.  Having  faith,  not  fear,  is  the  way  to  be  happy.   People  ask  me  about  that  "ole  debbil,"  pro-  fessional jealousy,  since  we  are  both,  as  it  were,  members  of  the  same  club.  Xot  a  chance,  I  tell  'em.  Clara  would  like  nothing  more  than  to  see  me  the  biggest  star  in  the  business.  She  was  the  biggest  star  once,  and  can  be  again  if  she  wants  to  be.  I  enjoy  seeing  her  success  and  her  pleasure  in  it.    *3  worth  of  protection  against  colds  for  H   PEPSODENT  ANTISEPTIC  is  3  times  as  powerful  as  other  leading  mouth  antiseptics.

Two  kinds  of  antiseptics   Remember,  there  really  are  only  two  leading  kinds  of  mouth  antiseptics  on  the  market.  In  one  group  is  the  mouth  wash  that  must  be  used  full  strength  to  be  effective.  In  the  other  group  is  Pepsodent  Antiseptic,  utterly  safe  if  used  full  strength,  yet  powerful  enough  to  be  diluted  with  two  parts  of  water  and  still  kill  dangerous  germs  within  10  seconds.    Don't  fool  yourself  by  diluting  old-  type  antiseptics.  Your  health  is  too  important  —  also,  consider  the  impor-  tance of  a  pure,  sweet  breath.

THE  ORIGINAL  TOMATO  JUICE  COCKTAIL   College  Inn  Food  Products  Co.   Hotel  Sherman,   Chicago     ■    415  Greenwich  St.,  New  York    We  do  not  think  that  two  people  can  remain  in  pictures  indefinitely  and  be  happy.  The  pressure  is  too  great.  We  want  to  work  hard  while  we  are  young,  get  our  money  and  back  away.  I  think  one  member  of  the  family  can  continue  longer,  and  it  should  be  the  husband.  At  any  rate,  I  would  never  be  happy  idle,  no  matter  what  I  did.  My  wife  and  I  look  for-  ward to  the  time  when  we  can  live  on  our  ranch  the  year  round,  do  some  traveling  when  we  want  to,  and  have  children.  Two,  I  think,  would  be  ideal.   Clara  is  domestically  inclined,  but  she  is  not  the  type  who  can  go  out  in  the  kitchen  and  help  someone  else  get  dinner.  In  other  words,  do  the  puttering.  She  is  no  putterer.  No  sir.  She  has  to  take  the  department  over  and  run  the  works.  She  would  rather  have  her  pie  fail  on  her  own  initiative  than  succeed  on  some-  body else's.  That  is  like  her.  Whenever  she  has  been  in  a  jam,  she  hasn't  tried  to  shift  the  blame  to  anyone  else.   We  live  quietly  when  we  are  working,  spend-  ing many  evenings  alone  playing  two-handed  bridge  until  nine  o'clock  and  then  going  to  bed.  We  have  our  own  bed-rooms,  because  my  stu-    dio cal  s  are  generally  two  or  three  hours- be-  fore hers  and  she  can  sleep  that  much  Lier.   Our  friendships  are  all  tried  and  true.  We  agree  that  it  is  a  bad  idea  to  form  life-lor.3  attachments  overnight.   Clara  acts  on  impulse.  I  am  more  deliber-  ate. She  does  impetuous  things  that  spring  from  her  heart.  I  have  always  sort  of  envied  spontaneous  people  like  that.  You  see  imita-  tions of  it  all  over,  but  it  can't  be  forced.  Clara's  is  the  genuine  article.   From  my  observation,  two  opposite  natures  like  ours  get  along  better.  We  all  like  to  dis-  cover new  traits  in  our  beloved.  With  all  her  other  characteristics,  Clara  is  lots  of  fun.  I  think  too  many  wives  overlook  the  importance  of  being  a  playmate  as  well  as  a  helpmate.  Clara  and  I  could  be  cast  away  on  a  desert  isle  all  alone,  and  have  a  good  time  every  minute.   There's  a  whole  lot  to  making  a  man  con-  tented and  happy.  It  takes  a  smart  girl,  and  one  who  loves  her  man.  .  .  .  But  it  takes  a  smarter  one  to  make  him  want  to  make  her  happy.  To  feel  that  absolutely  anything  is  worth  giving  to  see  her  in  fine  spirits.   Perfect  wife?    Perfection  plus,  /  think.    Why  I  Love  Rex  Bell    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  29  \    in  the  house,  jumping  all  over  even-thing  .  .  .  dragging  the  china  off  the  table  when  we're  at  dinner,  chewing  up  our  best  living-room  rug.  You  know  how  playful  they  are.  And  when  a  Great  Dane  is  playful  .  .  .  Oh,  Lordy!   So  we  have  our  tiffs  about  whether  the  dogs  will  remain  outside  or  whether  they'll  come  in.  And  so  far  it's  been  fifty-fifty.   Then  I  love  monkeys.  And  Rex  doesn't.  Except  in  a  zoo.  And  so  we  have  our  words  over  monkeys  every  once  in  a  while.  .  .  .  But  really,  that's  about  all.   And  that's  not  very  much  to  get  excited  about,  is  it?   Speaking  of  zoos,  where  do  you  suppose  I  took  Rex  the  first  minute  he  arrived  in  New  York?  The  Bronx  Zoo,  of  course!  And  did  he  love  it!   You  see,  here  we  are  with  only  three  days    left  before  sailing  for  Europe  .  .  .  and  I  wanted  Rex  to  see  something  of  New  York.  It  seemed  a  shame  going  all  the  way  off  to  Europe  and  strange  places  when  you  haven't  even  had  one  tiny  peep  at  the  grandest  town  in  the  world.  So  I  thought  the  zoo  was  the  best  place  to  start.   But  the  funniest  thing  was  this.  We  were  motoring  up  Riverside  Drive  to  get  to  the  zoo.  All  at  once,  Rex  made  the  chauffeur  stop  the  car.  "Isn't  that  Grant's  Tomb?"  he  asked.  And  what  do  you  think,  here  I  was  born  and  bred  in  Brooklyn  and  I'd  never  even  seen  Grant's  Tomb  .  .  .  didn't  even  know  where  it  was.  Can  you  beat  it!  I  suppose  Rex  will  be  the  one  who'll  discover  the  things  worth  seeing  while  we're  traveling.   If  you've  talked  to  Rex,  he's  probably  told  you  about  my  cooking.    He  always  does  talk    Laurels  to  you,  Frank  Borzage,  for  your  deft  direction  of  "Bad  Girl."  And  to  you,  Helen  Hayes,  for  that  great  emotional  performance  in  "The  Sin  of  Madelon  Claudet."  Three  cheers,  Freddie  March  for  your  work  in  "Dr.  Jekyll  and  Mr.  Hyde."

I  expect  he  didn't  think  I  could  do  it.  Particularly  since  his  mother  is  one  of  the  grandest  cooks  alive.  Well,  if  he  hasn't  told  you  about  my  three  masterpieces,  I'm  going  to  brag  right  now.  If  you  ever  come  out  to  visit  us  on  the  ranch  you're  going  to  taste  biscuits  and  angel  food  cake  and  devil's  food  cake  that  will  make  your  eyes  roll  right  up  to  heaven.   Sure,  I  had  to  use  a  cook  book  at  first  .  .  .  to  learn  how  to  measure  things.  It  always  bored  me  to  have  to  measure  everything  exactly.  So  finally  I  just  got  sick  of  it  and  threw  the  darn  book  away.  Then  I  started  to  play  around  with  my  own  ideas  on  how  to  cook  vegetables  and  meats  and  make  sauces.  Oh,  boy!  you  know  the  kind  of  grand  rich  food  that  makes  one  put  on  pounds  and  pounds.  .  .  .  Well,  I  put  on  the  pounds  and  pounds.  You've  heard  about  that.  But  when  that  got  serious  I  took  them  all  off  again  by  sticking  to  a  tough  diet  for  three  months,  and  exercising  and  having  daily  massages  .  .  .  and  racing  around  the  ranch  like  mad.   XTO,  I  wasn't  irritable.  Ask  Rex.  I  never  -L^'felt  better  in  my  life.  And  Rex  says  I  never  looked  better  either.  But  that's  the  wonderful  thing  about  Rex.  He's  so  thought-  ful. He  remembers  all  the  little  things  to  say  that  mean  so  much  to  a  woman.  And  he  re-  members to  do  all  the  sweet  little  things  that  most  men  forget,  or  never  even  think  about.  He  never  gives  me  a  chance  to  be  really  irritable.   I  mean  things  like  this:  When  I  was  working  like  a  horse  at  the  studio  all  day,  coming  home  ready  to  drop  in  my  tracks  at  night,  there,  in  our  Beverly  Hills  house,  would  be  Rex,  waiting  to  pull  my  shoes  off  for  me.  And  if  I  looked  grumpy  and  too  tired  to  talk,  he'd  just  be  quiet  .  .  .  not  say  a  word  until  I  was  ready  to  talk  to  him.   And  while  I  was  here  in  New  York  for  the  premiere  of  "Call  Her  Savage,"  and  Rex  was  making  "Diamon'  Trail"  and  "Crashin'  Broad-  way" in  Hollywood,  he  sent  me  flowers  prac-  tically every  day.  And  every  day  there  was  a  letter  and  a  telegram.  And  we  talked  to  each  other  on  long  distance  at  least  ten  times.   Well,  we've  been  kidded  for  that  .  .  .  told  we  acted  like  sweethearts,  not  like  husband  and  wife.  But  if  more  husbands  and  wives  were  thoughtful  in  this  way,  there'd  be  more  happiness  in  the  world.   Of  course,  Rex  doesn't  understand  all  my  moods.  I  don't  think  men  ever  do  understand  all  the  different  things  that  go  on  in  a  woman's  mind,  do  you?  But  Rex  isn't  like  the  rest  of  them.  He  doesn't  ask  questions.  He  doesn't  force  me  to  give  explanations  until  I'm  ready.  And  then  I  always  do.   T  IKE  the  day  he  arrived  from  Hollywood.  -'-'We  were  both  terribly  excited  at  the  thought  of  seeing  one  another.  I  hadn't  slept  more  than  two  hours  the  night  before.  And  I'd  been  ill  all  week  with  laryngitis.  What  makes  it  worse,  I  wouldn't  stay  in  bed  as  the  doctor  ordered.  I  won't  give  in.  When  you've  fought  everything  all  your  life,  you  even  fight  a  silly  thing  like  a  sore  throat.  That's  me,  you  see.   Then  I  rushed  down  to  the  station  an  hour  early  and  sat  there  in  the  cold,  getting  more  fidgety  every  minute.  And  finally,  there  was  Rex  .  .  .  Looking  all  worn  out  and  dark  under  the  eyes  as  if  he  hadn't  slept  a  wink  either.  Which  he  hadn't.   Well,  women  are  funny.  Naturally,  he  was  excited  to  death  to  see  me.  But  do  you  know,  I  was  just  too  tired  and  weary  after  all  that  excitement  of  looking  forward  to  his  arrival  to  be  anything  but  dumb  .  .  .  and  a  little  weepy.  Of  course,  Rex  didn't  exactly  under-  stand. .  .  .  But  he  didn't  act  hurt.  He  just  said:  "Well,  honey,  you're  all  worn  out.  What  you  need  is  a  lot  of  rest  before  that  long  trip  of  ours.  So  just  you  forget  all  about  me.  I  can  take  care  of  myself.  I  won't  bother  you  at  all.'!   Now,  do  you  understand  why  I  love  Rex?    Have  you  a   Lordosis  backline?    Spencer   Individually  designed   CORSETS    A  WOMAN  seldom  studies  her  backline  enough.  When  she  is  dressing  she  sees  her  own  smiling  face  in  the  mirror  and  never  stops  to  think  that  her  backline  may  be  ruining  the  effect  of  her  dress.   One  of  the  most  troublesome  figure  faults  that  every  woman  has  to  guard  against  is  a  Lordosis  curve  —  a  deep  in-curve|  just  above  the  waistline  in  the  back  —  which  causes  the  lower  back  to  bulge  out.  It  completely  ruins  the  lines  of  snug-fitting  frocks.   ALordosis  backline,  a"spare-tire"  of  flesh  around  the  waistline  or  a  pouchy  abdomen — all  these  figure  faults  come  from  sagging  muscles,  Spencer  designers  have  discovered  how  these  fatigued  muscles  can  be  so  lifted  and  supported  by  an  individually  designed  Spencer  that  all  the  lines  of  the  figure  are  re-  stored to  youthfulness.

Valuable  hints  for  you   every  month    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  78  ]    Her  friend,  Julanne  Johnston,  was  attending  the  Hollywood  School  for  Girls  at  this  time  and  on  week-ends  ZaSu  would  visit  Julanne  and  prepare  for  the  big  dance  at  the  Hollywood  Women's  Club,  on  Saturday  nights.  And  what  a  time.  "Oh,  my!"  ZaSu  had  herself  a  pink  organdie  that  was  a  dress.  It  puffed  and  billowed  and  did  strange  things.  And  in  her  little  pink  organdie,  round  the  floor  she  flew,  a  beautiful  dancer,  her  trim  ankles  twinkling.  Then  the  pink  organdie  would  be  carefully  washed  and  ironed  for  the  very  next  Saturday  night.   TT  was  while  she  was  still  at  the  club  that  she  •'■fell  in  love  with  Tom  Gallery.  Madly  and  deeply.  Her  mother  didn't  want  ZaSu  to  marry  just  yet  and  perhaps  spoil  that  promis-  ing career,  so  up  until  the  very  last  minute,  ZaSu  couldn't  make  up  her  mind  what  to  do.  It  was  awful.  The  very  day  they  had  planned  to  marry,  ZaSu  was  still  running  around  in  circles.   The  phone  rang.  The  doorbell  rang.  Every-  thing rang.  ZaSu,  unable  to  pack  her  suit-  case amidst  so  much  excitement,  was  running  about  waving  a  step-in  in  one  hand  and  a  nightgown  in  the  other.   "All  right,  all  right,"  Tom  finally  announced,  "either  you'll  marry  me  or  I'll  go  away  this  minute  and  not  return."  So  that  settled  it,  and  a  few  minutes  later  ZaSu  and  Tom  stepped  into  the  car  that  King  Vidor  and  Florence  (now  Mrs.  Jascha  Heifetz)  had  waiting,  and  were  gone.   ZaSu  gave  him  every  ounce  of  love  she  knew  how  to  give.  But  Tom's  didn't  last.  With  her  two  children,  one  by  adoption  (Barbara  La  Marr's  little  Sonny),  she  lives  alone  since  their  divorce.   ZaSu  Pitts  possesses  the  greatest  under-  standing of  any  woman  this  or  any  other  town  ever  had.  There  isn't  a  thing  you  could  do,  no  matter  how  wretched  and  mean,  there  isn't  a  depth  too  low  for  you  to  sink,  that  ZaSu  couldn't  understand  the  whys  and  wherefores  and  reach  out  a  helping  hand.  She  has  a  terrific  weakness  for  the  weak.   Her  works  of  charity  are  beyond  number.  In  fact,  only  ZaSu  herself  knows.  And  often  the  people  she  has  helped  haven't  the  slightest  idea  of  the  source  of  the  help  given.  She  works  quietly  through  friends  and  organizations.   One  day,  ZaSu  met  a  former  favorite  of  the  screen  on  the  street.  She  told  ZaSu,  with  streaming  eyes,  of  the  help  she  had  received  from  such  and  such  a  person.  "Without  it,  I  would  have  died,"  she  said.  "I'm  glad,  so  glad,"  ZaSu  said.  And  the  friend  never  dreamed  that  ZaSu  herself  had  been  the  one  behind  the  helping  hand.   A^ OTHERS  and  babies  are  her  specialty.  *  '■'■Hundreds  and  hundreds  of  little  children,  but  for  ZaSu  Pitts,  would  have  gone  ragged  and  hungry.   She  is  a  woman  in  constant,  agonizing  pain.  Her  body  is  never  free  for  a  moment,  since  the  birth  of  her  baby,  from  racking  torture.  Often  at  midnight  she'll  trail  home  from  the  studio,  weary,  aching  with  pain,  tired  from  the  long  day's  work,  and  at  seven  she's  up  and  at  the  phone.  Calling  this  party  and  that.  "Did  you  get  the  money  or  the  food  to  so  and  so?  Will  you  do  this  today  for  them?"  Or  calling  Central  Casting,  "You  will  help  that  little  extra  today,  won't  you?  Please  promise  you  win."   A  certain  actress  whom  ZaSu  knew  but  slightly  fell  into  deep  trouble.  It  led  to  jail  and  ZaSu  followed  her.  Day  after  day,  with  a  thousand  pressing  things  to  do,  she  found  time  to  visit  this  unfortunate  woman.  When  they  took  her  on  to  prison,  hundreds  of  miles  away  from  Hollywood,   ZaSu   didn't  forget.    Time  after  time  she  made  the  long  journey  with  candy,  cigarettes,  a  joke,  a  smile,  a  hand-  clasp and  best  of  all,  understanding.   On  one  of  her  trips  to  San  Francisco  walking  quitely  along,  ZaSu  spied  a  very  old  man  on  a  corner  selling  apples.  His  eyes  looked  plead-  ingly at  the  busy  people  hurrying  by.  With-  out a  word,  ZaSu  seized  the  basket  of  apples,  and  was  off.  "Apples,  mister.  Apples,  lady,"  she  was  calling.  "Just  a  dollar.  Here  you  are."  Dashing  out  to  cars,  in  and  out  of  the  crowd.  The  bewildered  pedestrians  were  handing  out  dollars  and  clutching  red  apples  in  their  hands  without  knowing  just  how  it  came  about.  In  five  minutes  she  had  collected  a  handful  of  bills.  The  old  man,  to  this  day  perhaps,  wonders  who  this  good  Samaritan  could  have  been.   But  every  so  often  the  very  ones  she  helps  and  benefits  are  the  ones  that  turn  against  her.  Lay  plans  to  bleed  her,  or  grumble  openly  at  the  amount  given  or  the  work  secured.   It  has  never  embittered  her.  "You  see,  the  poor  dears,  it  was  really  my  fault.  I  just  didn't  understand,"  she'll  say,  hunting  and  searching  for  excuses  to  shield  them.   Withal,  she  has  a  grand  sense  of  humor.  Or  rather,  a  sense  of  the  ridiculous.  She  laughs  at  things  and  at  times  when  no  one  else  would  think  of  laughing.  Her  friends  know  it  and  they  know  better  than  to  meet  the  glance  of  those  violet  eyes  at  certain  times.   TN  one  of  those  Thelma  Todd-ZaSu  Pitts  -'-comedies  there  was  a  certain  bit  of  business  and  dialogue,  certainly  not  very  funny,  but  every  time  the  two  girls  reached  that  point  and  turned  to  look  at  each  other — well,  they  couldn't  go  on.  They  grew  hysterical  and  finally  the  whole  crew,  watching  and  waiting  for  that  moment,  grew  hysterical  with  them.  It  was  just  funny  to  ZaSu  and  she'd  have  laughed  if  they'd  have  killed  her.   Every  man  that  has  ever  worked  on  her  set  adores  her.  Yet,  she  is  a  woman  of  strong  positive  personality.  She  knows  exactly  what  she  wants  and  gets  it.  There  is  nothing  wishy-  washy  or  negative  about  ZaSu.  She's  definite,  strong,  determined.   Once  in  a  long  while  she'll  lose  her  temper  and  then  will  quietly  and  firmly  say  what  she  thinks.  They'll  stand  about  her  respectfully  and  a  bit  awed,  and  listen.  And  then  she'll  end  it  with  one  of  those  "oh,  my's"  and  every-  one will  be  in  tears  with  laughter.  ZaSu  included.   She  loathes  jewelry  and  never  wears  it.  But  yet  she  has  a  passion  for  lovely  clothes.  And  buys  them  for  her  friends  to  wear.   Did  you  ever  hear  the  story  of  ZaSu's  ermine  coat?  It  seems  ZaSu  went  out  and  purchased  one.  She  then  called  all  her  friends  on  the  phone  and  announced  she  now  had  an  ermine  coat  for  the  girls  to  wear  and  to  take  turns  now  and  decide  when  each  of  them  wanted  it.   And  if  I  should  tell  the  names  of  some  of  the  stars  in  Hollywood  that  have  strutted  into  the  swanky  Mayfair  or  glamorous  openings  in  ZaSu's  coat,  you'd  gasp  with  surprise.   HTHEY  were  laughing  one  day  about  ZaSu.  ■*■  It  seems  one  of  her  friends  returned  the  community  coat,  after  the  last  Mayfair,  and  ZaSu  looked  it  over.  "My,"  she  said,  "I'll  have  to  have  this  thing  relined.  The  girls  won't  want  to  wear  it  with  this  old  lining."   At  openings,  at  swanky  night  clubs,  at  most  any  place  stars  gather  and  glitter,  you'll  never  find  ZaSu.  She's  like  a  shadow  in  this  Hollywood  that  steals  in  and  out  of  people's  lives,  hiding  away  within  her  own  four  walls  with  her  two  beloved  children.   She's  capable  of  great  and  lasting  friendships.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  February,  1933    105    Claudette  Colbert  wears  this  stunning  costume  in  her  new  picture  role  of  a  queen.  It  seems  she  has  taken  a  mad  fancy  to  the  little  hat,  with  its  jaunty  feathering  poking  up  out  of  the  crown,  so  it  will  probably  become  an-  other fashion  fad.  Her  gown  is  a  henna  crepe  trimmed  with  cross  fox    Her  dearest  friends  are  those  same  girls  of  Studio  Club  days  whom  ZaSu  knew  when  she  was  making  a  few  dollars  a  week  instead  of  her  four-figured  salary  of  today.   Europe,  you  know,  rates  her  as  one  of  the  greatest  of  American  actresses.  Hollywood  rates  her  the  greatest  clown.  An  artist  worth  little  consideration.  For  instance,  they  seldom  hand  her  a  script.  "Ad  lib,  ZaSu,"  they  say,  "just  say  anything."   Most  of  the  time  they  never  bother  to  write  out  dialogue  for  her.   They  give  her  no  special  lighting.  No  thought.  They  drag  back  her  hair  from  that  lovely,  sensitive  face,  hand  her  a  drab  rag  or  uniform,  shove  her  on  and  she  walks  away  with  every  scene  they  throw  at  her.   V\  THEN  she  can  do  so  much  with  so  little,  W  what  do  you  think  would  be  the  result  if  the  same  effort,  care  and  opportunities  afforded  other  actresses  were  given  ZaSu  Pitts?   Some  day  this  Hollywood  may  awaken  to  a  tremendous  fact.  They  may  eventually  learn  that  here  in  their  midst  is  this  woman,  a  great  and  beautiful  actress,  and  a  great  and  beauti-  ful character.   Some  day— perhaps.

All  the  biggest  stars  were  enthusias-  tically knitting  for  them.  Ethel  Clayton,  Marguerite  Clark,  Beverly  Bayne,  Mary  Pickford,  Pauline  Frederick  and  a  bevy  of  others  were  pictured  engaged  in  this  patriotic  endeavor.   Did  you  ever  know  that  a  Mc-  Svveeny  of  Chicago  made  good  in  the  movies  in  a  big  way?  In  the  article  "From  Stenography  to  Stardom"  we  learned  that  Virginia  Yalli  (now  the  wife  of  Charlie  Farrell)  started  life  as  Virginia  Helen  McSweeny.   Who  said  the  Viking  invasion  was  com-  paratively recent?  The  Swedish  Warner  Oland  reached  Hollywood  long  before  the  Sphinx-  like Garbo,  and  an  interview  revealed  the  interesting  pre-movie  career  of  this  Scandina-  vian who  excels  in  Oriental  portrayals.  The  Mary  Pickford-Marguerite  Clark  competition  was  raging.    Harold  Lockwood    A  story  on  Harold  Lockwood  appeared  also — the  handsome,  talented  player  whose  successful  career  was  cut  short  by  death.  Families  were  featured  in  the  rotogravure  with  cunning  baby  pictures  of  Jane  and  Katherine  Lee,  a  charming  sisterly  pose  of  Norma  and  Constance  Talmadge  and  Ethel  Barrymore  with  her  three  beautiful  children.  Alice  Joyce  paraded  across  two  pages  as  a  ravishing  model  for  the  sea-  son's knock-outs  of  a  fashionable  couturiere.  Petrova's  "Daughter  of  Destiny,"  the  first  of  her  own  productions,  was  reviewed  along  with  "  Raffles''  which  brought  John  Barrymore  back  after  having  "been  absent  from  pictures  too  long  for  pictures'  good."  Other  features  were  "A  Little  Princess"  with  Mary  Pickford.  and  Douglas  Fairbanks'  silent  version  of  "  Reaching  for  the  Moon."

Isn't  it  jolly  to  contemplate  be-  ing able  to  refer  to,  say,  half  a  million  as  a  paltry  sum?  Mary  Pickford,  Norma  Talmadge,  Anita  Stewart,  Ruth  Roland,  Cecil  B.  DeMille  and  that  ju-  venile Midas,  Jackie  Coogan,  had  at  that  time  acquired  their  hardest  million — that  first  one.   Their  film  salaries  were  shrewdly  invested  in  oil,  real  estate  and  the  like.  (Jackie  Coogan 's  investments  today  include  stock  in  a  brassiere  factory.)  Mary  Miles  Minter  had  just  finished  her  million-dollar  contract  with  Paramount.  Pictures  of  her  new  home,  for  which  she  paid  $150,000  were  shown.   ZaSu  Pitts  and  Tom  Gallery,  recently  di-  vorced, were  then  Mr.  and  Mrs.,  both  playing  with  Agnes  Ayres  in  "A  Daughter  of  Luxury."    Pola  Negri    DeMille  was  making  "Adam's  Rib,"  with  Pauline  Garon,  Elliott  Dexter,  Milton  Sills  and  Theo-  dore Kosloff.   The  performance  of  Anna  May  Wong  in  "The  Toll  of  the  Sea  "  was  mentioned  as  the  best  por-  trayal of  the  month.   Pictures  of  Dorothy  Dal  ton,  Elsie  Ferguson,  Nita  Naldi,  Charles  deRoche,  May  McAvoy  and  Antonio  Moreno  bring  pleas-  ant reminders  of  these  old  favor-  ites.   The  then  reigning  vamp,  the  exotic  Pola  Negri,  was  the  cover  queen.   The  six  best  pictures  were  "Peg  o'  My  Heart"  with  Laurette  Taylor;  "The  Beautiful  and  Damned,"  "Quincy  Adams  Sawyer,"  "Minnie,"  "The  Hottentot"  and  "Down  to  the  Sea  in  Ships,"  the  film  that  started  Clara  Bow  on  her  career.

Her  red-headed  vivacity  sparkled  from  the  cover  and  the  story  of  her  life  revealed  her  conquering  spirit,  so  pluckily  shown  in  her  present  comeback.  She  won  plaudits  in  "Get  Your  Man,"  Charles  (Buddy,)  Rogers  playing  opposite  her.   Other  lauded  pictures  were  "Gentlemen  Prefer  Blondes,"  featuring  Ruth  Taylor;  "Chi-  cago," with  Phyllis  Haver;  "The  Enemy,"  starring  Lillian  Gish;  "The  Legion  of  the  Condemned,"  with  Fay  Wray  and  Gary  Cooper,  and  the  late  Milton  Sills  in  "The  Valley  of  the  Giants"  with  Doris  Kenyon.  "Wings"  was  the  long-run  picture  on  Broadway.   Places  in  the  gallery  were  accorded  Greta  Garbo.  Laura  La  Plante,  Betty  Bronson,  Lupe  Velez,  John  Mack  Brown,  Camilla  Horn,  Ruth  Taylor,  Renee  Adoree  and  John  Gilbert.   Clara   Bow,    Greta    Garbo,   Bebe    Daniels,    Ruth  Taylor    Sally  O'Neil,  Madge  Bellamy,  Joan  Crawford,  Olive  Borden,  Phyllis  Haver,  Janet  Gaynor,  Lois  Moran,  Mary  Philbin  and  Jetta  Goudal  were  dodging  the  wedding  ring.  Joan  Crawford  threatened  never  to  marry  as  long  as  she  could  support  her-  self. Of  the  famous  twelve  only  four  are  still  outside  the  mar-  riage circle — the  Misses  Garbo,  O'Neil,  Moran  and  Philbin.   We  told  of  finding  Mary  Miles  Minter    living    in    obscurity    in  Paris  with  her  mother.    She  was  a  voluntary  exile  seeking  peace  after  the  pub-  licity over  the  Taylor  case.   The  story  of  Lon  Chaney's  rocky  road  to  fame  revealed  that,  as  the  son  of  deaf  and  dumb  parents,  he  unconsciously  learned  pantomime,  this  being  his  only  means  of  communication  with  them.

Ex-star!  I'll  say  I  am.  There  are  lots  of  pictures  you've  seen  me  in  lately,  for  the  wax-  things  are  I've  been  lucky.  In  the  old  days  I  helped  a  lot  of  people  and  made  many  friends.  and  now  a  few  of  them  are  glad  to  do  something  for  me.  It  isn't  so  hard  to  throw  a  day's  extra  work,  a  bit,  or  even  a  small  part  my  way  if  they  want  to — and  some  of  those  who  "knew  me  when"  are  willing  to  do  it.   I'm  willing  to  take  whatever  I  can  get.  I've  swallowed  my  pride  long  ago.   SOMETIMES  the  pill  has  been  a  bit  bitter,  though.  It  was  especially  bitter  once.  Thinking  over  old  acquaintances  whom  I  might  ask  for  work,  I  remembered  one  whom  I  was  sure  would  be  glad  to  do  something  for  me.  I  would  almost  have  staked  my  life  on  him.  He  used  to  be  my  leading  man.  Since  then  he  has  become  a  director  at  one  of  the  biggest  studios,  with  big  cars,  a  big  house  at  Malibu,  and  all  that  sort  of  thing.   I  helped  him  get  his  first  job  plaj-ing  opposite  me,  and  I  used  to  help  him  even  in  his  personal  affairs,  patching  up  his  squabbles  with  his  girl.   So  sure  was  I  of  him  and  his  welcome  that  I  went  all  the  way  to  his  beach  house  to  see  him.  Malibu  is  a  long  way  from  Hollywood  for  a  girl  who  has  to  ride  the  bus.  and  the  bus  fare  is  a  lot  for  a  girl  who  is  broke.  But  so  sure  was  I  that  I  gambled  my  last  few  cents  to  get  there,  and  then  walked  from  the  end  of  the  busline.  He  was  giving  a  party.  A  lot  of  Hollywood's  big  names  were  there.  I  did  not  belong;  I  knew  that  directly  I  saw  him.  He  took  me  quickly  into  a  little  anteroom  where  there  was  no  danger  of  my  being  seen.  Sand-  wiches and  decanters  were  everywhere,  and  I  was  famished;  but  he  didn't  offer  me  anything  to  eat  or  drink.  He  didn't  even  ask  whether  I  hid  eaten.   I  couldn't  help  thinking  of  the  innumerable  times  when  he  had  been  a  guest  at  my  house  in  the  old  days — but  no  matter.

Chicago    "I'm  trying  to  begin  over  again,"   I   told  him,  "and  you're  in  the  very  spot  where  you '  can  help  me.    I  need  a  job."   "I'll  see  what  I  can  do,"  he  answered,  "but  — well,  you  see — "   "Oh,  I'm  not  asking  for  anything  big,"  I  told  him,  "I'll  do  whatever  you  can  give  me.  A  small  part,  a  bit,  extra  work  even — any-  thing."   "Yes,  yes — of  course.  Er — well,  leave  your  name  and  telephone  number,  and  I'll  let  you  know."   He  left  me  sitting  there  and  went  back  to  his  guests.  I  saw  him  again  at  the  studio  and  repeated  my  request.  I  even  asked  a  mutual  friend  to  speak  to  him  for  me,  because  I  knew  he  could  help  me  if  he  wanted  to.  But  I  guess  he  didn't  want  to.  Anyway,  I  have  never  heard  a  word  from  him  from  that  day  to  this.   ~KA  ANY  of  my  "fair  weather"  friends  look  *■  ''■'-the  other  way  when  they  see  me  coming.  They  would  rather  not  bother  speaking  to  me.  If  I  ask  them  for  work  they  give  me  a  dull  shake  of  the  head  and  mutter,  "I'm  sorry — I'll  see  what  I  can  do."  Then,  when  I  leave,  they  turn  to  whoever  is  near  them:   "See  that  girl?    Well,  she  used  to  be — "   In  the  old  days  I  gave  many  of  them  money  to  look  after  their  sick  wives  and  kids.  I  got  them  jobs,  saved  jobs  for  them  when  they  were  going  to  be  fired.  Now  some  of  them  are  up;  but  they  don't  seem  to  remember  me.  That's  what  it  means  to  relinquish  the  throne.  That's  what  it  means  to  fall  from  the  pinnacle.  That's  what  it  means — to  be  an  ex-star.   How  did  it  happen?  Well,  it  happened  in  a  number  of  ways.   To  begin  with,  none  of  us  can  turn  our  backs  on  the  calendar.  Just  as  in  the  prize  ring,  youth  will  be  served.  Some  of  us  accept  de-  feat; others  try  to  hang  on.  You've  seen  an  aging  champion  in  the  ring  take  fearful  punish-  ment from  a  fighter  just  coming  up — and  an  aging  star  who  tries  to  remain  at  the  top  despite  her  loss  of  popularity,  makes  a  spectacle  just  as  pathetic.   Some  of  us  go  into  character  parts — and    some  are  too  far  gone  even  for  that  before  we  realize  that  we're  gone  at  all.  After  that,  it's  retirement  if  we  can  afford  it,  and  extra  work  if  we  can't.  And  then,  some  of  us  make  mistakes.  Mistakes  that  automatically  take  us  off  the  screen.  Some  of  us  come  back,  and  others  don't.   In  my  particular  case  I  left  the  screen  at  the  height  of  my  career  to  marry.  My  husband  was  a  colonel  in  the  British  army,  and  I  went  to  India  with  him.  We  were  divorced  some  time  ago,  and  it  became  necessary  for  me  again  to  make  a  living.  Naturally  my  thoughts  turned  to  Hollywood,  and  I  came  back  to  the  screen.   I  am  still  a  young  woman,  but  I  had  been  away  eight  years — too  long.  Perhaps,  had  I  remained  here,  the  story  might  have  been  the  same.  It  is  the  same  with  too  many  stars.  None  of  us  can  last  forever.   "VX7HEN  I  came  back  I  thought  I  had  *»  many  friends.  I  did  not  expect  stardom  again,  of  course,  but  there  was  no  reason  why  I  shouldn't  get  good  parts.  I  thought  that  I  would  have  no  trouble  getting  work.  How-  ever, I  did  not  know  my  Hollywood.   I  went  to  see  those  old  friends — some  of  them  in  very  important  places  now- — but  there  were  no  cheers.  I  left  my  telephone  number,  but  the  telephone  seldom  rang.  So,  like  all  the  others,  I  started  the  round  of  the  casting  offices.  I  was  afoot;  my  limousine  with  its  liveried  chauffeur,  like  the  name  which  means  nothing  now,  belonged  in  the  past.   But  it  was  an  old  friend  who  did  give  me  my  first  job  after  I  came  back.  I  had  been  pounding  the  pavements  for  days;  that  morn-  ing I  was  flat  broke.  I  hadn't  had  any  break-  fast; I  didn't  know  just  when  or  where  I  was  going  to  get  any.  Then  I  saw  a  face  I  knew,  and  this  time  it  was  a  face  which  wasn't  turned  away  when  it  saw  me  coming.   "Why,  Miss  MacLaren — "   He  came  towards  me  with  hand  outstretched.  It  was  Ben  Stoloff,  who  had  been  a  prop  boy  in  the  old  days  when  I  was  a  star.

Within  the  hour  I  was  made  up  and  playing  a  bit.  I  have  found  out  since  that  the  bit  wasn't  in  the  script  at  all;  he  had  thought  it  up  for  mc  right  there.   "Why  didn't  you  come  to  me  before?"  he  i  as  he  took  me  to  lunch  and  listened  to  my  tale  of  woe.  I  was  eating  ravenously;  hungry  girls  do.   I  told  him  that  I  hadn't  known  he  had  risen  to  be  a  director,  and  that,  anyway,  most  of  the  directors  I  had  known  in  the  old  days  had  turned  me  down.   "Yes,"  he  said  quietly.  "I  guess  most  of  'em  would.      That's   Hollywood."    T  there  were  a  few  others  who  knew  what  vas  up  against,  who  were  willing  to  do    TJ  UT  1  -L>I  wa   anything  they  could.  Among  them  was  Frank  Lloyd,  who  found  a  job  for  me  in  his  big  special,  "Cavalcade";  Harry  Joe  Brown,  who  used  me  in  "Billion  Dollar  Scandal";  Ralph  Incc,  who  gave  me  a  bit  in  Radio's  "Heroes  for  Hire,"  and,  lately  quite  a  few  others.   I  am  grateful  to  all  of  them.  I  am  bitter  against  none.  In  the  others  I  am  just — well,  disappointed.   I've  started  again.  I  manage  to  make  some  sort  of  a  living.  Still.  I  can't  lose  the  feeling  that  I'm  waiting,  always  waiting  for  the  assi>tant  director  to  come  over  to  my  chair:   "We're  ready  for  you  now,  Miss  MacLaren."   But  he  doesn't  come  now,  of  course.  Besides,  I  haven't  any  chair.    Instead,  I  hear  him  yell:   "Now,  you  people  in  the  background,  try  and  get  some  life  into  it.  You're  all  happy —  you're  having  a  whale  of  a  good  time — "   Of  course  we  are.  I  am.  I'll  get  a  ten-  dollar  check  and  tonight,  dead  tired,  I'll  go  back  to  my  little  apartment  and  try  not  to  think  of  the  time  when  I  was  a  star.  I'll  ride  home  on  the  bus,  cook  a  simple  little  meal  on  the  gas  plate,  and  eat  it  by  myself.  There  won't  be  anyone  waiting  there  to  bother  me  with  a  bushel  or  so  of  fan  mail,  and  the  tele-  phone won't  ring  with  someone  wanting  me  to  put  on  my  diamonds  and  go  to  a  big  party.  I'll  wash  out  my  stockings  and  underthings,  and  then  maybe  I'll  read  a  bit,  if  I  can  stay  awake.  I'll  get  up  tomorrow  morning  at  six  to  be  made  up  on  the  set  at  nine;  I  don't  dare  be  late  now.  That  is,  I'll  be  on  the  set  if  I'm  lucky,  for  even  ten-dollar  checks  don't  come  along  every  day.   VERY  few  of  the  people  I  work  with  now  know  that  I  was  once  a  star.  I  don't  tell  them,  and  not  many  remember.  A  new  star  is  born — and  the  old  one  is  forgotten.  Pathetic?  Well,  perhaps  it  is.   But  it's  life,  and  as  Edna  Ferber  says,  any  experience  we  have  in  life  is  just  that  much  velvet.  Sometimes  it  feels  more  like  burlap,  though.   Sometimes  some  of  my  old  acquaintances  tell  me  that  I'm  on  my  way  back,  that  I'm  headed  for  stardom  again.  I  know  they're  only  trying  to  cheer  me  up.  But  I  don't  think  I  would  want  to  be  a  star  again,  even  if  it  were  true.   I'm  an  ex-star  now,  and  I've  learned  many  things.   I've  learned,  for  instance,  who  my  friends  really  are.   Eve  learned  the  inestimable  value  of  real  friendship  as  distinguished  from  the  synthetic,  the  flattering  kind.  I've  learned-  to  live  simply,  and  that  simplicity  is  the  only  road  to  happiness.   A  star  is  a  goldfish  in  a  bowl,  showing  her  glittering  glory  to  the  public  gaze.  Her  life  is  lived  for  her — she  never  has  a  minute  of  her  own.   She  has  to  do  this,  she  has  to  do  that,  whether  she  wants  to  or  no;  her  stardom  is  a  ball  and  chain  around  her  soul.  She  is  chained  to  big  mansions,  to  big  incomes  and  expenses,  to  big  affairs  and  big  careers.   I  am  an  ex-star  and  at  last  I  am  free — free  to  find  my  next  month's  rent,  my  next  job  and  my  next  meal,  wherever  I  can.

Thotoplay  Magazine  for  February,  1933    I  I  I    Only  Muni  Can  Dolt    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  35  ]   him.  He  isn't  handsome  like  Buddy  Rogers.  When  only  partly  finished,  they  decided  to  cut  the  bridge  in  half.   "The  end  of  the  year  came  around  and  they  took  up  my  option.  Yet  I  had  had  only  that  one  picture.  It  was  a  weird  time;  a  night-  mare.   "One  moment  I  decided  to  get  myself  a  swimming  pool  and  swim  the  rest  of  my  life  in  Hollywood.  The  next  moment  I  told  myself  I'd  go  to  New  York.   "Then  they  made  a  test  to  see  if  Muni  could  act.  I  used  only  plays  for  that  test  in  which  I  had  done  character  roles.  That  gave  them  the  clever  idea  I  was  to  be  a  Lon  Chaney.   "They  bought  a  brilliant  little  story,  'A  Friend  of  Napoleon.'  They  wanted  Muni  to  play  six  statues  that  came  to  life.  Even  the  yes-men  voted  against  it.  But,  somehow,  the  picture  was  made  (used  with  the  title  "Seven  Faces")  without  much  credit  to  anybody.   "BY  this  time  I  had  begun  to  wake  up.  I  ■^learned  that  exhibitors,  the  men  who  show  the  pictures  to  the  audiences,  have  a  lot  to  do  ■with  a  player's  success.  And  they  knew  noth-  ing of  Muni.   "Then  I  was  sent  out  on  personal  appearances  with  the  six  statues.   "On  the  train  coming  back  I  received  a  telegram  to  read  a  book  called  'Louis  Beretti.'  I  was  already  'sold'  to  exhibitors  for  'Mad  Musician,'  'Rasputin,'  'Louis  Beretti'  and  'Liliom.'  I  bought  'Louis  Beretti'  and  read  it  on  the  train.  It  seemed  like  a  good  vehicle.  I  was  pleased.  And  when  I  arrived  in  Holly-  wood, I  discovered  Edmund  Lowe  was  to  do  it,  and  Charlie  Farrell  was  scheduled  for  'Liliom.'   "Instead  of  saying,  'Go  on  home  and  forget  us — your  name  does  not  mean  anything,'  they  tried  to  give  me  a  little  role  in  'Liliom.'   "Everyone  told  me  to  be  'subtle.'  They  talked  about  Hollywood  politics.   "One  of  the  big  directors  was  in  'the  dog  house'  just  then.  He  had  done  something  to  displease  them.  I  met  him  at  the  studio  gate  one  morning  and  he  asked  me  where  I  was  going.  I  told  him  I  was  going  in  to  see  the  producer  for  the  last  time.   "  'Don't  be  a  fool,'  he  told  me.  T  am  in  bad.  I  come  to  the  studio  and  collect  my  $3,500  every  week.'   "He  urged  me  to  take  the  little  part  in  'Liliom'  and  collect  my  salary.   "I  went  on  to  the  producer  and  said,  'Let's  finish  this  business!'   "I  had  made  up  my  mind.  I  didn't  and  don't  give  a  whoop  for  Hollywood  unless  Holly-  wood gives  a  whoop  for  me.   "T  DON'T  want  them  to  think  they  are  doing  ■*-  me  a  favor  or  me  doing  them  one.  I  wasn't  going  to  be  hanging  around  if  they  didn't  really  want  me.  I  don't  believe  there  is  money  enough  in  Hollywood  to  keep  me  there  if  I  am  not  wanted.   "If  I  must  work  upon  the  idea  of  pleasing  everybody  and  displeasing  myself — I  will  not  work.   "I  had  about  $22,000  coming  on  my  con-  tract and  I  settled  for  $10,000.  And  I  said  I  would  never  sign  a  straight  contract  in  Holly-  wood again  and  I  meant  it.  I  will  choose  my  stories  and  make  pictures  only  under  my  present  conditions.  I  have  in  my  arrangement  that  I  am  not  to  be  starred  and  I  do  not  argue  about  money.  Starring  and  money  are  not  important  to  Muni.     Good  stories  are!"   I  looked  at  Paul  Muni — expecting  to  see  his  eyes  flashing.  Instead,  they  were  twinkling.  "I  do  not  think  I  am  temperamental.  Just  sensible.     As  I  tell  it,  I  see  the  whole  story.    To  save  teeth  you  must  fight  film    WHAT  is  this  film  that  robs  us  of  our  teeth?  A  slippery,  sticky  coating  formed  by  the  mucin  in  saliva.  It  stains  teeth  yel-  low. It  catches  bits  of  food  which  soon  decay.  Yes,  but  that's  not  all!  Film  contains  mil-  lions of  tiny  germs.   Some  are  rod-shaped,  grouped  in  clusters.  These  are  decay  germs.  As  they  live  they  give  off  enzymes  that  produce  lactic  acid.  This  lactic  acid  dissolves  tooth  enamel  just  as  other  acids  eat  holes  in  cloth.  Other  germs  are  linked  with  "trench  mouth"  —  still  others  with  pyorrhea.   "What  must  I  do  to  fight  film  ?"   To  fight  film  use  Pepsodent  instead  of  ordi-  nary tooth  pastes.  Why?  Because  a  tooth  paste  is  only  as  good  as  its  polishing  mate-  rial—  not  one  bit  better.  The  new  polish-  ing material  in  Pepsodent  is  one  of  the  great  discoveries  of  the  day.  Its  power  to  remove  every  trace  of  film  stain  is  revolu-  tionary! Its  notable  distinction  of  being  twice  as  soft  as  polishing  materials  in  com-  mon use  has  gained  wide  recognition.  Remember,  the  one  safe  way  to  fight  film  is  to  use  the  special  film-removing  tooth  paste— Pepsodent— twice  every  day  and  to  see  your  dentist  at  least  twice  a  year.    See  how  rapidly  film  forms  on  teeth    These  teeth  were  absolutely  free  of  film  at  8  a.  m.

It  is  quite  funny. "   Not  many  people  could  leave  Hollywood  like  that  and  return  to  it.  But  Paul  Muni  is  an  actor  and  Elollywood  does  need  true  actors.   His  reputation  is  for  being  temperamental.  Not  difficult  to  understand  the  reason!   That  reputation  was  renewed  during  the  Olympic  games.   He  refused  to  allow  visitors  on  his  set — and  picture  studios  during  the  Olympics  were  like  Westminster  Abbey  during  the  London  tourist  season.   One  day,  a  guide  brought  some  "most  im-  portant" persons  to  his  set.   Mr.  Muni  left.  "When  they  have  seen  the  picture  being  shot,  I  will  return."   Temperamental !   "TT  is  difficult  enough  for  an  actor  to  get  -Mn  front  of  a  camera.  He  has  to  work  hard  to  get  before  a  machine  and  breathe  into  it  life.  It  is  a  challenge  to  any  actor  unless  he  is  a  great  technician.  I  do  not  mean  an  actor  must  live  his  part  exactly,  but  from  the  moment  he  first  reads  it,  he  does  get  a  vibration.   "He  must.  Something  begins  boiling  within  him  and  he  only  gives  his  best^when  he  is  at  the  boiling  point.   "So  often  something  happens  during  that  point  in  pictures.  The  sound  track.  Some-  thing. And  visitors  are  most  disconcerting.  I  cannot  help  that.   "Guides  and  sightseers  take  me  out  of  my-  self and  make  me  self-conscious.  If  that  is  temperament — .   "To  me  it  is  just  being  myself.  I  am  not  an  exhibit  like  an  actor  is  supposed  to  be.   "I  have  been  on  the  stage  twenty-four  years.  I  guess  I  am  an  idealist  about  it.  The  joy  of  doing  the  thing  I  want~to  do.  I  have  given  up  more  money  to  do  the  things  I  want  to  do—. "   An  idealist  whom  Hollywood  could  not  understand.  Neither  could  Broadway  in  the  early  days.  Ten  years  ago  he  was  offered  an  opportunity  to  play  with  Laurette  Taylor  in  "Humoresque."  He  chose,  instead,  "We  Americans" — the  part  of  an  old  man,  which  gave  him  a  chance  at  human-interest  char-  acterization. Friends  and  advisers  thought  him  crazy.  The  billing  with  Laurette  Taylor  would  have  been  five  times  as  high.  The  money  twice  as  much.   The  reputation — .  Yet  he  did  the  other  be-  cause he  wanted  to  do  it.  And  he  has  practi-  cally followed  that  course  ever  since.   INDEPENDENT.  Living  up  to  a  code.  -'■Allowing  himself  to  be  shown  in  perform-  ances only  of  his  own  choosing.  "I  got  my  feet  on  the  ground  in  Hollywood — and  I  intend  to  keep  them  there. "   It's  the  only  way  for  a  person  to  get  the  drop  on  Hollywood,  but  it  takes  a  fearlessness  possessed  by  so  few  that  it  makes  Paul  Muni  the  single  exception  among  so  many.    Heart  Throb    Most  of  my  life  reading  has  been  my  greatest  pleasure.  Not  long  ago  I  lost  my  sight.  I  had  seldom  been  to  see  a  movie.   Now  I  turn  to  talkies  as  my  one  recreation.   Although  unable  to  see,  I  can  fol-  low the  thread  of  the  story.  In  the  silences  my  granddaughter  whispers  what  the  actors  are  doing  and  I  cr.n  make  a  mental  picture.   The  talkies,  I  feel,  have  kept  me  from  going  insane.

DAS    SCHOENE     ABENTEUER     {EN-  CHANTED ESCAPADE)— UFA    A  GROOM  without  a  bride — a  bride  with-  out a  wedding  ring.  Otto  Wallburg —  Kaethe  von  Nagy.  The  stage  is  set  for  an  elaborate  wedding,  the  guests  are  assembled,  when  the  unwanted  groom-to-be  discovers  his  bride  has  deserted.  She  and  her  lover  flee  to  the  home  of  her  grandmama,  whose  assumption  that  the  couple  are  newlyweds  causes  many  complications.   THE  UNWRITTEN  LAW—  Majestic  Pictures   A  MAN  has  held  in  his  heart  and  ever-  -**■  present  in  his  mind  an  intense  desire  to  avenge,  according  to  his  own  code,  a  great  wrong.  Quite  coincidental  is  the  meeting  of  this  man  (Purnell  Pratt)  with  the  famous  pro-  ducer (Lew  Cody),  who  has  wronged  him.  One  night  he  tells  their  story  and  asks  his  hearers  for  a  verdict  of  life  or  death  for  the  villain.  And  what  do  you  suppose  their  decision  is?  Sure,  you're  right!  Mary  Brian,  Hedda  Hopper  and  Greta  Nissen  also  in  cast.   SELF-DEFENSE— Monogram   pAULINE  FREDERICK  deserves  a  better  ■*-  vehicle  but  the  picture  is  good  entertain-  ment. She  plays  Kaly  Devour,  who  runs  on  the  level,  a  Canadian  saloon  and  gambling  hall.  She  conceals  it  from  her  daughter  in  boarding-  school.  Heavy  gets  in  dirty  work,  girl  appears  at  awkward  time,  place  is  hastily  transformed  into  an  inn.  Pauline  is  excellent.  Very  good  supporting  cast.   YORCK—  UFA   DURING  a  trying  period  in  Prussian  history  —1811-1812— General  von  Yorck  was  forced  to  lead  his  men  against  the  Russian  army.  Werner  Krauss,  in  the  title  role,  gives  a  vivid  portrayal  of  the  commander  who,  al-  though he  does  not  engage  in  actual  battle,  endures  mental  anguish  utterly  incomparable  to  any  physical  danger.  No  English  sub-titles  to  aid  those  not  up  to  par  on  their  German.   ROBBERS'  ROOST— Fox   A  WESTERN  'way  above  the  average,  with  ■*»■  lots  of  stunt  riding,  fancy  riding  and  packed  with  thrills.  The  crooked  foreman  of  a  tenderfoot  Englishman's  Arizona  ranch  rustles  both  the  boss'  steers  and  his  ingenue  sister,  but  George  O'Brien,  as  one  of  the  hands,  puts  an  effectual  stop  to  that.  George's  best  film  so  far:  Maureen  O'Sullivan  looks  lovely.   THAT'S  MY  BOY— Columbia   A  NOTHER  football  story  but  nevertheless  ■*»-entertaining.  The  spectacular  college  career  of  the  likeable  young  hero  (Richard  Cromwell)  combines  love,  sports  and  a  unique  angle  of  "big  business"  duping  gridiron  heroes.  The  cast  includes  Dorothy  Jordan,  Mae  Marsh,  Lucien  Littlefield  and  Robert  Warwick.    «t    i.

OPPORTUNITY   The  Magazine  That  Finds  Jobs  and  Teaches  Salesmanship   919-PH-2  N.  Michigan  Ave.,  CHICAGO    THE  DEATH  KISS— World  Wide    A  NOTHER  mystery  picture  with  a  studio  ■*  ^-background.  The  leading  man  is  mur-  dered during  the  filming  of  a  scene,  and  the  leading  lady,  his  wife,  is  accused.  David  Manners,  as  the  scenario  writer,  turns  amateur  detective  and  clears  everything  up.  Adrienne  Ames,  as  the  movie  star,  hasn't  much  to  do.  A  knockout  cast  including  Bela  Lugosi,  John  Wray,  Barbara  Bedford.   THE  FORTY-NINERS— Freuler  Film   A  VEST-POCKET  edition  of  "The  Covered  ■*  *■  Wagon,"  largely  assembled  from  stock  film  shot  about  that  time.  A  crooked  scout  betrays  the  wagon  train,  the  Indians  attack,  a  buffalo  herd  stampedes,  and  the  U.  S.  cavalry  shows  up  just  in  the  nick  of  time.  A  lot  of  action,  but  not  very  interesting.   THE  VIRGINS  OF  BALI— Principal   A  XOTHER  authentic  glimpse  in  the  -**-"Goona  Goona"  mold,  of  courtship  and  marriage  as  practised  in  the  Dutch  East  Indian  island  of  Bali,  with  abundant  shots  of  the  carefree  young  ladies  in  their  sketchy  costumes,  to  fill  out  the  leisurely  progress  of  the  heart  affair.  Deane  H.  Dickason  explains  native  customs  as  the  screen  presents  them.   SLIGHTLY  MARRIED— Invincible   SLIGHTLY  MARRIED"  is  slightly  enter-  taining with  Walter  Byron  and  Evalyn  Knapp  in  and  out  of  trouble  and  marriage.  Im-  pulsively marrying  a  girl  of  the  streets,  Byron  grows  to  love  her  only  to  have  his  family  tear  them  apart  and  hurry  him  into  another  engage-  ment. But  love  and  a  little  baby  conquer  all  and  the  lovers  are  remarried.  Marie  Prevost  is  funny  in  a  bit  and  Jason  Robards  is  the  usual  double-crossing  pal.   NO  LIVING  WITNESS—  Mayfair  Pictures   PRETTY  dull  stuff.  Noah  Beery  plays  a  "ha-ha-ha"  type  of  villain  in  a  picture  of  swindle  and  seduction  that  ends  with  his  murder,  of  which  Barbara  Kent,  the  heroine,  is  accused.  She's  cleared  by  the  discovery  of  a  recording  machine  in  Beery's  office  and  all  is  well.  Gilbert  Roland  as  the  young  assistant  district  attorney  has  little  to  say.  Carmel  Myers  slinks  around  rolling  her  eyes  and  sigh-  ing "Caris-si-ma-a."  Otis  Harlan  is  satisfac-  tory in  a  not  so  comic  role.   YOUNG  BLOOD— Monogram   A  FEEBLE  little  story  with  a  slight  Robin  Hood  flavor  that  wanders  over  a  great  deal  of  Western  territory  and  gets  nowhere.  Bob  Steele  is  a  naughty  hold-up  man  fin  league  with  a  crooked  sheriff)  who  falls  in  love  and  reforms.    Helen  Foster  is  the  girl.   HYPNOTIZED— World  Wide   YT  THEN  it's  funny,  it's  very,  very  funny,  but  W  when  it  isn't,  it  lets  you  down  badly.  Not  enough  Moran  and  Mack.  But  there's  a  dog  and  a  swell  lion  and  an  elephant  that  do  very  well.  Wally  Ford  and  Maria  Alba  a  hot  pair;  Charlie  Murray  as  circus  owner  and  Emest  Torrence  as  hypnotist  furnish  the  laughs.  The  story  of  a  bridegroom  hypnotized  on  his  wed-  ding eve.   SPEED  DEMON— Columbia   ORDINARY  program  entertainment,  trite  story,  but  the  kids  will  go  for  the  speed-  boat races.  Buster  Collier  (Speed)  is  the  driver  who  is  framed,  but  wins  out  in  the  end.  Georgie  Earnest,  who  plays  an  orphan  asylum  runaway,  shows  unusual  promise.  Frank  Sheridan  is  convincing  as  Cap,  the  old  boat-  builder.    Joan  Marsh  is  the  love  element.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  February,  1933    "5    HEART  PUNCH— May  fair  Pictures   A  ROMANCE  of  the  prize  ring,  but  the  romance  is  fortunately  rather  better  than  the  prize-fighting  scenes.  A  cast  of  old-time  favorites,  among  whom  you'll  recognize  Wheeler  Oakman  as  the  fight  promoter,  Lloyd  Hughes  and  Marion  Shilling  as  the  lovers,  Mae  Busch  and  George  Lewis.  Oakman's  perform-  ance stands  out  with  Gordon  De  Main,  as  the  defense  attorney,  running  a  close  second.  Not  especially  recommended.   THEY  JUST  HAD  TO  GET  MARRIED  — Universal   SLIM  SUMMERVILLE  and  ZaSu  Pitts  in  a  domestic  comedy  about  an  on-and-off  divorce.  Slim  as  a  butler  and  ZaSu  as  a  maid  are  left  a  fortune,  and  Yerree  Teasdale,  as  a  scheming  wife,  compromises  Slim;  ZaSu  who  has  obtained  an  interlocutory  decree,  retaliates  by  doing  the  same  thing,  which  automatically  voids  the  decree  and  regains  Slim.  Story  weak,  but  Slim  and  ZaSu  come  through.   FLAMING  GUNS— Universal   HPOM  MIX,  foreman  of  Bill  Farnum's  ranch,  ■*■  rounds  up  the  cattle-rustlers  and  falls  in  love  with  the  boss'  daughter,  Ruth  Hall.  The  boss  has  him  arrested  rather  than  have  him  for  a  son-in-law,  but  Tom  breaks  jail,  grabs  Ruth,  and  heads  Tony  over  the  border,  pursued  by  a  posse  of  motorcycle  cops  and  Bill's  Rolls-  Royce.  Clarence  Wilson  stands  out  as  the  conniving  uncle.   MAN  AGAINST  WOMAN— Columbia   A  BOUT  an  iron-jawed  plain  clothes  terror  •*  *-(Jack  Holt),  who  makes  up  his  mind  to,  and  finally  marries  a  blondined  torch-singer  (Lillian  Miles),  employed  in  an  underworld  czar's  night  club.  After  much  police  and  gang  melodrama,  our  hero  cleverly  lands  the  entire  gang  in  jail.  What  saves  the  sorry  busi-  ness is  bad  guy,  Walter  Connolly,  eating  his  way  (literally)  through  the  entire  picture — and  Photoplay  being  read  during  the  tensest  scenes.    BEWARE  HALF-CURED   COLDS!   They  Expose  You  to  a  Weakened  System   and  to  the  Dangers  of  Serious   Complications  I   DON'T  temporize  with  a  cold.  Don't  take  remedies  that  merely  allay  the  cold  instead  of  getting  it  thoroughly  out  of  the  system.  A  half-cured  cold  is  a  cold  never  cured  and  a  constant  source  of  danger.    A  cold  calls  for  specific  treatment -    "I  Couldn't  Write  a  Better  Prescription  Myself!  "    It's  called  an  "overseas  cap,"  this  jaunty  little  hat  worn  by  Adrienne  Ames.  It  matches  her  brown  tweed  suit.  Isn't  that  a  tricky  and  yet  be-  coming arrangement  for  the  plaid  scarf  attached  to  the  blouse?  It  pulls  through  slits  under  the  jacket  collar    for  internal  treatment.  There  is  one  remedy  for  a  cold  that  meets  all  the  requirements  of  efficacious  treatment  —that  is,  GROVE'S  LAXATIVE  BROMO  QUININE!   The  Four  "Things  Necessary   Grove's  Laxative  Bromo  Quinine  knocks  a  cold  and  knocks  it  quickly  because  it  does  the  four  things  required.   First  of  all,  it  opens  the  bowels  gently  but  thoroughly,  the  first  step  in  expelling  a  cold.   Second,  it  kills  the  cold  germs  in  the  system  and  reduces  the  fever.   Third,  it  relieves  the  headache  and  grippy  feeling.   Fourth,  it  tones  the  entire  system  and  fortifies  against  further  attack.   This  is  the  treatment  a  cold  calls  for  and  anything  less  is  only  playing  with  a  cold.   For  more  than  40  years  Grove's  Laxative  Bromo  Quinine  has  been  the  standard  cold  and  grip  tablet  of  the  world.  Don't  let  anybody  tell  you  he  has  something  better  for  a  cold.  Responsible  druggists  never  try  to  substitute  on  Grove's  Laxative  Bromo  Quinine.

Smart  Hollywood  Gives  Spring  Fashions  An  Early  Boost   by  Seymour    THE  far-famed  California  sunshine  really  gives  Hollywood  stars  an  edge  on  the  rest  of   the  country  when  it  comes  to  spring  fashions.   Right  now  out  here  you  can  dash  about  see-  ing all  sorts  of  new  trends  that  point  to  what  everybody  will  be  wearing  several  months  from  now.   Constance  Bennett  appears  at  lunch  in  a  new  striped  print  frock.  You  jot  down  prints  in  your  notes — striped  prints.  Adrian  de-  signs a  dress  for  Joan  Crawford's  new  picture  — it's  that  new  silk  called  matelasse  and  is  trimmed  with  pique  bows,  of  all  things!  And  it  has  a  slit  skirt — a  new  trend  you  mentally  note.  Incidentally,  you  girls  are  going  to  miss  seeing  the  usual  array  of  Crawford  fashions  in  Joan's  new  picture  because  she  plays  the  part  of  an  ambulance  driver  with  a  war  story  back-  ground— uniforms  will  be  the  principal  cos-  tumes.   T7ACATI0NERS  at  Palm  Springs,  one  of  *  the  most  popular  desert  resorts  within  driving  distance  of  Hollywood,  return  with  sun  tanned  skins.  Thus  at  once  you  surmise  that  white  and  vivid  shades  to  complement  the  sun  tan  will  be  a  great  summer  vogue.  Shirts  and  shorts  or  slacks  and  a  shirt  are  the  favorite  sports  garb  at  Palm  Springs.   And  at  famous  Malibu  beach,  the  beach  frock  fad  started  by  Bennett  and  Tashman  last  year,  promises  to  thrive  smartly  through  a  new  season.   A^UCH  beige  hosiery  is  being  worn  about  ■'■''-'-town  for  daytime.  However,  Norma  Shearer  contradicted  the  general  trend  for  cop-  pery colored  evening  hose  by  wearing  beige  hose  to  match  a  beige  ensemble  for  evening.  This  smart  coppery  glint  for  evening  is  quite  in  line  with  sun  tanned  skins.    "yOU  won't  envy  the  stars  so  much  when  J-  you  hear  that  long  and  tedious  hours  have  to  be  spent  in  fitting  rooms  while  a  new  ward-  robe is  being  made  ready  for  a  picture.  Kay  Francis  is  in  the  midst  of  such  a  siege  now.  She  will  wear  dozens  of  stunning  new  gowns  and  wraps  when  next  you  see  her.   And  Barbara  Stanwyck,  who  certainly  hasn't  been  given  a  fashion  break  in  recent  pictures,  is  going  to  wear  some  knockout  cos-  tumes in  her  next  picture.   pONSTANCE  CUMMINGS  is  a  clever  girl  ^* — and  a  well-dressed  one.  She  told  me  the  other  day  that  she  much  prefers  to  buy  clothes  that  are  made  for  her  by  the  studio  designers.  And  she  added  that  she  buys  all  the  accessories  for  a  costume  at  one  fell  swoop.  Blue  is  a  never  failing  color  entry  in  the  spring  list.  Nancy  Carroll  was  hurrying  down  the  boulevard  a  few  days  ago  in  a  bright  blue  rabbit's  wool  frock.  A  matching  blue  hat  was  brimmed  and  her  accessories  were  a  darker  shade  of  blue.   AT  a  recent  opening  of  a  picture,  Lilyan  ■**-Tashman  wore  an  ankle  length  brown  velvet  coat  over  an  orange  dress— a  striking  alliance.  Any  number  of  evening  slippers  with  jeweled  heels  were  seen  at  this  affair — a  majority  of  the  frocks  accompanying  these  slippers  were  ankle  length,  thus  giving  the  jeweling  full  spotlight.  Helen  Vinson,  whom  you  have  probably  noticed  recently  in  several  pictures,  wore  an  interesting  ensemble  to  a  dance  at  the  Cocoa-  nut  Grove  the  other  evening.  A  long  brown  velvet  wrap  had  epaulets  of  sable.  With  this  she  wore  a  small  brown  velvet  hat  caught  at  one  side  with  a  brilliant  pin.  Helen  possesses  a  very  fair  skin  and  light  brown  hair,  so  she  wisely  chooses  brown  and  shades  of  yellow  or  gold  for  her  personal  wardrobe.    Why  Norma  Shearer  Says  "Let  the  Honeymoon  Wait'    -'>'>    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PACE  51  ]    "Forgive  wholeheartedly  and  completely  or  not  at  all.  When  a  man  has  made  a  mistake,  make  your  forgiveness  gracious  and  then  for-  get about  it.  Only  the  unwise  wife  refers  to  it  again,  making  both  her  husband  and  herself  miserable  by  its  repetition.   ""NTEVER  intrude  on  your  husband's  busi-  ■'-^'ness  hours.  It  must  be  annoying  to  any  busy  man  to  have  his  wife  telephone  him  in  the  midst  of  his  work,  or  drop  in  to  interrupt  him  with  some  matter  which  could  easily  wait  until  evening  and  his  leisurely  consideration.   "Your  domestic  problems  should  never  be-  come a  topic  of  conversation.  That's  the  wife's  job  and  a  constant  complaint  about  servants  or  bills  or  household  affairs  is  simply  an  open  confession  that  the  job  is  too  big  for  her.   "Never  let  the  children  take  first  place,  above  your  husband,  in  your  interests  and  affections.  They  are  separate  individuals  with  their  own  lives  to  live  and  you  must  build  for  the  happiness  of  the  years  when  they  will  be  grown  and  away  from  you.   "The  five  words,  'I  have  nothing  to  wear,'  have  caused  more  marital  upsets  than  many    more  serious  phrases.  Having  something  to  wear  is,  I  think,  as  much  a  part  of  a  woman's  job  as  managing  her  home  or  taking  care  of  her  children.  The  wise  wife  will  budget  her  money  and  plan  her  wardrobe  so  that  there  is  at  least  one  wearable  dress  for  every  occasion.   "Plan  your  day  so  that  you  can  be  freshly  dressed  when  your  husband  comes  home.  Nothing  must  be  more  irritating  to  a  man,  tired  by  a  day's  work,  than  to  come  home  to  an  upset  household  and  a  disheveled  wife.   "Become  interested  in  the  things  which  interest  your  husband.  You'll  be  surprised  how  easy  it  is  to  share  his  pleasures,  and  how  delighted  he'll  be  to  have  you  take  an  in-  telligent  interest   in   them.   "T  AST,  but  by  no  means  least,  talk  things  •^over  together.  Share  your  plans  and  your  ideals.  This  applies  especially  to  the  girl  who  has  been  in  business,  who  has  become  accustomed  to  living  her  own  life  and  to  making  her  own  plans  with  no  one  to  consider  except  herself.  A  sane  and  sensible  considera-  tion for  the  desires  and  wishes  of  your  husband    Photoplay  Magazine  for  February,  1933    will  do  much   to  help  make  your  marriage  happy."   So  much  for  rules.  Now  for  a  few  "don'ts."  "Don't  feel  neglected  if  your  husband  wants  to  spend  an  occasional  evening  away  from  you.  Instead,  encourage  him  to  see  his  men  friends,  to  do  the  things  he  did  before  marriage  with  the  same  freedom  from  oppressive  re-  straint.   "You'll  be  surprised  at  the  enjoyable  time  you  can  have  by  yourself,  smearing  cold  cream  on  your  face,  reading  the  book  you've  been  wanting  to  read  for  so  long,  arranging  your  hair  in  a  new  mode,  writing  those  long-ne-  glected letters,  perhaps  seeing  an  old  friend  and  indulging  in  an  evening  of  satisfying  woman-gossip.   "TAON'T  annoy  or  antagonize  your  husband  ■*— 'in  the  matter  of  make-up  and  clothes.  But  don't  throw  your  make-up  out  the  window.  Effect  a  compromise.  If  your  husband  ob-  jects to  the  rouge  and  lipstick  just  as  you  are  starting  out  for  an  evening,  agree  with  him  pleasantly,  walk  out  of  the  room,  turn  around  three  times  and  come  back,  asking  eagerly,  'Is  it  better  now?'  Invariably  he  will  agree.  And  away  you  go,  everyone  happy  and  satis-  fied. "Don't  think  too  much  about  yourself ,  feel  too  sorry  for  yourself,  or  take  yourself  too  seriously.  Honestly,  I  find  that  the  only  time  I'm  really  bored  is  when  I've  been  thinkin;  too  much  about  a  certain  person  called  Norma  Shearer.   "Don't  harbor  grievances  against  your  hus  band.  There  is  nothing  more  irritating  than  a  sulky  wife.  Talk  it  over,  quietly.  Tell  him  how  and  when  he  has  hurt  you.  That  is  much  better  than  allowing  the  grievance  to  rankle  and  grow  until  it  assumes  vastly  magnified  proportions.   "Eliminate  bitterness.  Don't  foster  it  by  a  hurt  and  unreasonable  silence.   "Last  of  the  don'ts,  but  one  of  the  most  important — don't  let  jealousy  run  away  with  you.  Even  if  you're  fairly  bursting,  conceal  it.  Always  place  the  prettiest  woman,  the  one  in  whom  he  is  most  interested,  next  to  your  husband  at  the  dinner  table.  Encourage  him  to  talk  to  other  women,  even  to  flirt  with  them  a  little  if  he  wishes.  Don't  be  rabidly  possessive  just  because  you  are  married  to  him."   Miss  Shearer  smiled  again,  half  humorously  this  time.  "Don't  make  me  sound  like  the  source  of  all  wisdom,  please.  Don't  let  your  readers  think  for  one  minute  that  I  haven't  made  dozens  of  mistakes  in  spite  of  my  wonder-  ful theories.  Because  I  have.  But  I  don't  mind  admitting  it  when  I'm  wrong  and  I  don't  mind  saying,  'I'm  sorry,  Irving.  I'll  try  never  to  do  it  again.'   "A  woman's  career  does  have  a  bearing  on  the  success  or  failure  of  her  marriage.  I  feel  that  having  a  career  gives  her  a  great  ad-  vantage over  the  woman  who  has  no  outside  interest.   "I  sincerely  believe  that,  instead  of  giving  up  a  career  for  love,  a  woman  should  take  up  a  career.  It  makes  her  more  interesting,  more  capable  of  inspiring  and  holding  her  husband's  love.   "  A  ND  please  understand  that  by  career  I  -*»-don't  necessarily  mean  a  professional  one.  Every  woman  can't  be  a  business  executive,  a  writer,  a  musician  or  an  actress.  Any  out-  side interest,  any  vital  and  absorbing  work  or  hobby,  which  will  keep  her  alert  and  alive,  will  serve  the  same  purpose."   Do  you  wonder  that  Norma  Shearer  is  successful  in  both  a  movie  career  and  in  matrimony?  I  don't.  Because  her  parting  words  were  these:  "After  all,  if  a  woman  is  honestly  and  sincerely  interested  and  en-  thusiastic in  making  her  marriage  a  success,  it  just  can't  fail."   That  goes  for  a  career,  too.   And  Norma  Shearer,  Mrs.  Irving  Thalberg,  is  one  of  the  most  enthusiastic,  the  most  interested — and  interesting! — personalities  in  Hollywood.

Winners  Of  $1,000  Puzzle  Contest    HERE  they  are — the  eighty-three  prize  winners  in  Photoplay's  ninth  annual  Cut  Picture  Puzzle  Contest,  select-  ed after  careful  checking  and  re-check-  ing of  the  thousands  of  entries  by  the  judges.  Checks,  ranging  in  amounts  from  $5  to  $300,  have  been  put  in  the  mail  and  will  be  in  the  hands  of  the  happy  in-  dividuals at  practically  the  same  time  they  receive  this  issue  of  Photoplay.   Again,  as  in  previous  years,  entries  in  this  fascinating  contest  came  from  all  parts  of  the  world.  In  selecting  the  winners  the  judges  kept  in  mind  the  rule    which  specified,  "Aside  from  accuracy  in  completing  and  identifying  the  cut  puzzle  pictures,  neatness  and  simplicity  in  con-  testants' methods  of  submitting  solutions  will  be  considered  in  awarding  prizes."  That  was  a  task  with  thousands  of  neat,  simple  yet  attractive  solutions.   The  entry  of  Marye  C.  Hicks,  of  Chi-  cago, 111.,  won  the  unanimous  vote  of  the  judges  for  first  prize;  Edith  L.  White,  of  Rochester,  N.  Y.,  was  awarded  the  second  prize,  and  Chas.  K.

She  was  witnessed  by  her  second  "discoverer,"  Eddie  Dowling,  playwright,  actor,  manager.   Eddie,  during  a  Washington  engagement,  had  noted  Katie's  performance — perhaps  from  three  blocks  away.  He  hired  her  for  his  new  musical  comedy,  "Honeymoon  Lane."  Kate  Smith  was  launched  on  Broadway,  and  the  resulting  swell  flooded  the  boardwalk  at  Coney  Island.   T\7HAT  happy  days  for  Big  Girl !  Probably  **  as  happy  as  any  she's  known.  She  was  a  hit.  She  was  making  pretty  good  money — I'll  never  forget  her  girlish  pleasure  over  her  first  modest  diamond  ring.  She  sang  and  she  Charlestoned  and  she  went  on  home  to  her  mama  in  a  small  side-street  apartment.  Glorious  days,  those,  on  the  way  up!   Then  she  appeared  opposite  Mr.  Bert  Lahr,  rubber-faced  comic,  in  "Flying  High."  Another  success.  Movie  houses  and  vaudeville  began  clamoring  for  her — smothered  her  with  luscious    pay-checks.    Radio  lured  her.  She  was  an  instantaneous  socko,  for  the  microphone  and  loud-speaker  love  that  big  round  voice.  "When  the  Moon  Comes  Over  the  Mountain"  became  her  theme  song  and  her  pet  sensation,  and  she's  been  lugging  the  moon  to  wealth  and  glory  ever  since.   And  that,  mates,  is  a  lightning  review  of  Big  Girl's  public  career.   But  that's  only  Kate  the  Performer.   What  about  Kate  the  Woman?   It's  always  the  living,  laughing,  loving,  suffering  human  being  behind  the  career  that  is  inevitably  fascinating.  The  girl  behind  the  lipstick.   I  know  the  real  Kate  Smith,  too.   And  it  is  wonderful  to  realize  that  her  spirit  is  as  sweet  and  generous  and  rich  as  that  remarkable  voice.   Her  heart  must  very  nearly  fill  that  ample  body.  Where  there's  room  for  the  voice-box  I  really  can't  say.  Add  to  her  sweetness  a  great  gay  spirit  that  is  always  on  tap  for  her  friends,  and  you  have  as  winning  a  girl  as  you  could  excavate  in  a  world-wide   census.     Her  sub    rosa  generosities  would  fill  a  couple  of  fat  books.   And  she's  always  the  same  swell  Kate,  now  that  she's  plastered  with  cash  and  written  large  in  electric  lights.   She  still  lives  modestly  —  and  Broadway  whispers  that  she  has  some  $300,000  soaked  away  in  government  paper.  Hauling  that  old  moon  over  the  mountain  has  been  worth  the  effort.   "DOY  friends?  Sure — Kate's  had  'em.  She  '-'likes  'em,  and  why  not?   And  so  Kate  breezes  along,  singing  her  songs.  One  of  the  grandest  girls  whose  Charleston  ever  threatened  a  reinforced  stage.   Six  years  ago !  Then  Kate  eagerly  went  out  to  Toll  House  Tavern  and  sang  for  her  supper  — and  little  else.   Now  she  luxuriates  in  Hollywood  and  sends  that  rich  voice  rolling  over  the  wild  air  waves  to  millions.   Kate's  the  biggest,  sweetest  Cinderella  who  ever  found  a  glass  slipper  on  the  floor  of  a  Hollywood  studio.     More  power  to  Big  Girl.    Who  Is  Hollywood's  Greatest  Screen  Lover?    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  34    to  screen  sweeties  it's  a  cinch  she  would  have  been  cuckoo  long  before  now.   It  was  shortly  after  this,  that  Pola  Negri  came  from  Europe  in  a  blaze  of  glory  and  Con-  rad was  chosen  as  her  first  American  leading  man.  At  the  time,  Gloria  Swanson  was  queen  of  the  Lasky  lot — and  the  battle  was  on  be-  tween Gloria  and  Pola.  Mabel  Normand,  it  later  appeared,  had  "ribbed"  Pola,  while  on  the  boat,  to  demand  a  dress-  ing bungalow  just  like  Gloria's;  and  Pola  got  it,  too.   "And  it  was  Pola,  not  Garbo,"  Conrad  added,  "who  coinedthat phrase;  'I  tank  I  go  home  now.'  She  would  call  her  maid,  'Schnapps'— and  believe  me,  the  two  of  'em  would  go  home  on  the  least  pro-  vocation."    "NJEXTon  the  list  with  ^-^  Conrad  were  Hope  Hampton,  Nita  Naldi,  and  tragic-eyed  Alma  Rubens.  During  the  making  of  "Lawful  Lar-  ceny," in  which  Conrad  made  love  to  Nita  in  New  York,  she  caused  a  ten-day  sensation  by  appearing  without  stockings  and  resting  her  feet  on  the  rail  of  her  box  in  the  Metropolitan  Opera  House.   Lucille  Ricksen,  Claire  Windsor,  Mae  Busch,  Patsy  Ruth  Miller,  Eleanor  Boardman  fol-  lowed. Conrad  made  love  to  all  of  them  as  the  script  demanded.  Then  to  Blanche  Sweet,  who  quarrelled  constantly  with  her  director-hus-  band, Mickey  Neilan.    "The  only  thing  that  would  stop  them,"  said  Conrad,  "was  when  the  set  orchestra  played  'Mamma  Loves  Papa,  Papa  Loves  Mamma,'  which  was  a  popular  tune  of  the  time."   Norma  Shearer  was  next  with  "  Excuse  Me,"  and  then  Conrad  did  the  part  which  alone  should  give  him  the  title,  hands  down.  That  was  "Three  Weeks,"  with  Aileen  Pringle.  Then  came  Marion  Davies  and  Garbo.    You've  read  the  answer  by  now,  so  there's  no  use  making  a  secret  of  it.  Behold,  Conrad  Nagel,  screen  lover  of  more  charming  women  than  any  other  three  men  you  could  name — and  a  pillar  of  the  church,  as  well  as  spokesman  for  the  industry,  in  his  hours  off  duty.  To  round  out  the  picture  we  see  the  two  real  loves  of  his  life — Mrs.  Nagel  and  their  twelve-year-old  daughter,   Ruth   Margaret,   at  their   beautiful   home   in   Beverly   Hills    Since  the  movie  infant  has  learned  to  talk,  Conrad  has  played  opposite  and  made  love  to  Dolores  Costello,  Eleanor  Boardman,  Gene-  vieve Tobin,  Catherine  Dale  Owen,  Loretta  Young,  Anita  Page,  Lila  Lee,  Myrna  Loy,  June  Collyer,  Leila  Hyams,  Kay  Johnson,  Bernice  Claire,  Ann  Harding,  Madge  Evans,  Doris  Kenyon,  Dorothy  Mackaill,  Joan  Blon-  dell,  Betty  Compson,  Evelyn  Brent,  Virginia  Bruce,  and  so  on  and  on,  ad  infinitum.  The  above  is  not  a  complete  list,  because  Conrad's  memory  failed  him  after  getting  that  far.  Be-  sides which,  he  has  play-  ed repeats  with  many  of  these  named.   So,  little  girl  with  a  crush  on  Conrad,  don't  be  discouraged.  If  you  want  to  meet  your  hero  in  the  flesh  all  you  have  to  do  is  to  come  to  Holly-  wood and  be  a  movie  star — and  it's  a  cinch  that,  sooner  or  later,  he'll  hold  you  in  his  arms.  He's  held  them  all.    THAT'S  why  Conrad  Nagel  is  the  greatest  lover  of  the  screen,  with  a  record  that  is  almost  a  certainty  to  stand  for  all  time.  Bring  on  your  Barrymores,  your  Gables,  your  Rafts,  Warren  Williams,  and  Chevaliers,  and  then  bring  on  your  hearts  and  flowers.   Conrad  can  spot  'em  all  a  Ziegfeld  chorus  and  then  win  in  a  walk.  He  has  picked  all  the  orchids  in  Hollywood's  garden  of  love — and  what's  more,  he's  still  picking  'em.    122    Photoplay  Magazine  for  February,  1933    123    Hollywood  Fashions   by  Seymour   Here  is  a  list  of  the  representative  stores  at  which  faithful  copies  of  the  smart  styles  shown  in  this  month's  fashion  section  (Pages  62-67)  can  be  purchased.

Elissa  frankly  confessed  she  was  happier  on  the  Paramount  lot  in  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross"  than  she'd  ever  been  on  the  home  lot.   "TN   love?"    repeated    Lee    Tracy,  when  asked  if  it  was  true  about  him  and  Peggy  Hopkins  Joyce.   "Why — it  must  be  love !  Only  last  night  she  gave  back  a  $10,000  brace-  let I  bought  for  her."   rT"'HE  only  bubble  of  sadness  in  Clara  Bow's  bucketful  of  joy  when  she  left  for  New  York  was  that  she  had  to  leave  her  two  pet  white  mice — if  you  can  imagine  Clara  with  pet  white  mice — behind.  While  out  on  the  desert  with  Rex  she  one  day  caught  a  little  field  mouse  whom  she  called  Mickey  Mouse,  and  when  he  died  in  Hollywood  because  of  the  lower  altitude,  she  bought  two  white  mice,  which  she  called  Lvdia  PinkhamandSnookums.    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PACE  84  ]   But  Clara  should  cheer  up — because  by  the  time  she  gets  back  from  Europe  she'll  probably  have  a  whole  flock  of  white  mice.   rT"'HE  death  of  Joel  McCrea's  father,  Thomas  P.  McCrea,  brought  to  light  Joel's  family  background,  which  comparatively  few  knew.   The  McCrea  family  is  one  of  culture,  wealth  and  distinction.   They  have  lived  in  Los  Angeles  since  the  horse-car  days.   The  elder  McCrea  was  an  executive  officer  and  member  of  the  directorate  of  one  of  the  city's  largest  corporations.   XX7HEN  Lucien  Littlefield  finished  work  on  "Rasputin,"  which,  as  everybody  knows,  was  months  be-  hind schedule  before  it  was  finally  completed,  his  next  job  was  with  a  little  independent  concern.   Lucien  noticed  the  assistant  direc-  tor   pacing    the    floor    with    a    deep    furrow  of  worry  on  his  brow.  lie  asked  what  seemed  to  be  the  trouble.  "Trouble?"  exploded  the  a.  d.  "My  God,  this  is  awful.  Do  you  realize  we  are  half  an  hour  behind  schedule?"   P^ATHARINE  HEPBURN  bas  Hollywood   on  its  ear  with  her  didoes.  But  the  climax  came  when  Katharine  calmly  lay  down  in  the  main  street  of  the  Radio  Pictures  studios  to  read  her  fan  mail.   Anything  for  sensation.   "DOMBARDED  by  questions  from  all  sides,  Norma  Talmadge  and  George  Jessel  found  time  to  have  their  own  private  laugh  out  of  the  report  that  Norma  had  guaranteed  the  $100,000  property  settlement  George  made  upon  his  wife,  Florence  Courtney.   "We  will  be  accused  next  of  blowing  up  the  Maine,"  Jessel  wired  Norma,  "when,  as  everyone  knows,  Harry  Green  did  it."    Will  she  star — or  will  she  not?  This  haunting  question  keeps  eyes  of  Hollywood's  prophetic  jury  perpetu-  ally on  the  lesser  luminaries..

Not  in  many  a  day  have  we  received  as  steady  a  chorus  of  praise  as  that  which  keeps  coming  for  "Smilin'  Through."  But  now  "A  Farewell  to  Arms"  is  setting  a  similar  pace  with  Gary  Cooper  and  Helen  Hayes  sending  the  readers  into  tearful  ecstasies.     Above  is  a  glimpse  of  their  final  scene    THE  S25  LETTER   When  I  came  home  after  seeing  "Smilin'  Through,"  everything  seemed  to  have  a  new  meaning.  I  tinkered  the  cheap  curtains  at  the  window,  the  little  yellow  ribbon  that  I  used  to  tie  them  back  with,  in  fact,  I  even  saw  beauty  in  their  simplicity.  I  ceased  to  think  about  money,  expensive  curtains,  a  mansion,  glam-  orous people,  parties.  Things  that  made  me  dissatisfied  seemed  to  be  forgotten.   Why  cannot  we  have  more  beautiful  pictures  like  that?  In  these  hard  times  it  has  been  those  pictures  of  sophistication  and  glamour  and  grand  people  that  have  made  us  more  dissatisfied.  They  have  helped  to  magnify  our  trouble,  until  we  have  forgotten  how  to  smile.  Thanks  to  Miss  Shearer,  who  'has  realized  what  we  wanted  even  before  we  fully  realized  it  ourselves.  And  congratulations  on  her  superb  portrayal.   Mrs.  A.  Fessia,  New  York  City   THE  $10  LETTER   'Midst  all  those  brickbats  hurled  at  Craw-  ford's mouth,  Garbo's  acting,  etc.,  may  I  throw  a  few  bouquets  in  praise  of  the  work  of  the  screen  for  itself  and  us  women?   The  screen  has  undoubtedly  made  actors  and  actresses  into  sophisticated,  arresting  human  beings  of  presence,  poise,  allure.  Never  shall  I  forget  Conrad  Nagel's  booming,  unromantic  voice  as  I  first  heard  it.  Today,  I  drink  in  every  word.  And  just  contrast  the  Crawford  of  yesterday  and  gawky,  freckled,  buxom  Garbo  "who  couldn't  wear  clothes,"    6    with  the  glamorous  creatures  they  are  today!  The  motion  picture  has  surely  made  women,  who  naturally  copy  th  se  arresting  types,  evolve  from  the  fluffy-haired,  sexless  creatures  of  five  years  ago  into  sophisticated,  youthfully-  mature,  radiant  personalities.   Mary  K.  Joxes,  Tucson,  Ariz.   PERHAPS  it's  strange  and  per-  haps it  isn't — but  this  month  it  was  a  dead  heat  between  Norma  Shearer  and  Clara  Bow.  Next  came  the  cascade  of  brickbats  tossed  on  our  doorstep  for  the  article,  "Cary  vs.  Gary,"  which  appeared  in  our  January  issue.  The  majority  were  for  Gary  Cooper,  whom  they  say  is  genuinely  unique!  Though  Cary  Grant  has  won  many  loyal  followers.   As  to  pictures — we  predict  that  tributes  to  "A  Farewell  to  Arms"  will  run  as  strong  as  the  flood  still  pour-  ing in  to  commend  "Smilin'  Through."  Of  the  other  recent  re-  leases "The  Bitter  Tea  of  General  Yen"  and  "Flesh"  received  many  commendations.   Because  Mickey  Mouse  has  spread  so  much  joy  and  laughter  o'er  the  world,  one  reader  feels  conscience-  stricken  about  trapping  the  "pan-  try thieves"  in  her  home.   Appreciation  is  voiced  for  the  producers  who  show  the  cast  both  at  beginning  and  end  of  their  pic-  tures.    THE  $5  LETTER   Temporarily  unemployed,  dejected  and  dog-  tired,  I  wandered  into  the  theater  today.  I  was  so  "down  in  the  dumps,"  I  hardly  knew  what  was  showing,  and  cared  still  less,  sus-  pecting that  I'd  sleep  through  most  of  it  any-  way. Imagine  sleeping  through  a  picture  like  "The  Conquerors."  What  a  tonic  it  turned  out  to  be !  And  what  a  buoyant  spirited  fellow  emerged  two  hours  later!  Faith  restored  in  my  country,  myself  and  my  fellow  citizens!   Never  before  have  I  written  to  a  movie  mag,  but  after  seeing  "The  Conquerors,"  why  I  just  had  to  get  it  out  of  my  system.   J.  L.  Thompson,  Lynchburg,  Va.   "CARY  vs.  GARY"   Jack  Jamison  said  in  the  January  Photo-  play that  Gary  Cooper  "doesn't  know  how  to  walk,  talk,  or  how  to  put  over  a  scene,  the  way  a  trained  actor  does."  Well,  I  challenge  that  statement!  I  have  seen  Gary  in  "A  Farewell  to  Arms"  and  he  does  as  good  a  job  of  acting  as  I  have  ever  seen.   Glenn  A.  Broquist,  Rock  Island,  111.   In  your  January  Photoplay  you  said  there  was  a  fight  between  Gary  Cooper  and  Cary  Grant  to  see  who  would  stay  on  the  screen.  Gary  Cooper  will  not  fail.  Yesterday,  in  the  opening  scenes  of  "A  Farewell  to  Arms"  we  only  saw  Gary's  lips,  but  those  lips  which  are  so  sensitive  and  show  his  feelings  which  no  other  actor's  does,  identified  him  at  once.  All  around  me  I  could  hear  "Gary  Cooper"  being  whispered,  and  I  want  to  tell  you  many  of  them  were  men.   When  the  Japanese  girls  named  Gary  "Sweetheart  of  the  World"  they  hit  it  right  on  the  head,  for  he  is.  There  is  no  question  at  all,   Gary  will  win.   Miss  Elizabeth  Piemme,  Mobile,  Ala.   I  dislike  hearing  that  Gary  Cooper  resembles  Cary  Grant  or  anyone.  Gary  is  different.  That  queer  little  crooked  smile  is  incom-  parable. Montgomery  and  Chevalier  may  well  feel  a  tweak  of  envy,  for  none  other  compels  masculine  admiration,  who  at  the  same  time  draws  the  feminine  "oh,  ohs."  Gary  is  genuinely  unique!   Mrs.  Homer  Peach,  Greensboro,  N.  C.   We  are  for  Gary  Cooper  ten  million  strong.  You  can  find  the  Cary  Grant  kind  anywhere,  but  you  never  find  Gary  Cooper  unless  you  go  to  the  show.  If  one  has  to  go,  let  it  be  Cary  Grant,  for  if  you  don't,  we  will  never  go  to  another  picture  that  studio  puts  out.  The  Girls'  Gang  of  Davidson  College,  Davidson,  N.  C.   So  glad  Paramount  has  given  Cary  Grant  a  contract.  I  am  a  great  Gable  fan,  but  Cary  has  everything  Gable  has — maybe  not  so  much  acting  ability,  but  more  looks,  more  charm  and  a  most  infectious  smile.  If  they  must  choose  between  Gary  Cooper  and  Cary  Grant  let  me  cast  a  million  votes  for  Cary.  Give  him  the  parts  that  M-G-M  gives  Gable  and  watch  his  smoke.   Osa  Pfarr,  Hillsboro,  Ohio   TRUE  APPRECIATION   Tonight,  after  I  had  seen  Nils  Asther's  portrayal  of  General  Yen,  I  was  convinced  that  I  had  witnessed  a  nearly  flawless  interpreta-  tion of  an  Oriental.

A    HENRY    KING   Production    What  the  Audience  Thinks    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  6    In  "The  Bitter  Tea  of  General  Yen"  Barbara  Stanwyck  and  Nils  Asther  give  such  superb  portrayals  that  one  of  our  readers  hopes  if  their  work  cannot  be  equaled,  the  producers  will  let  Oriental  films  rest   forever    most  people  ashamed  of  their  marriage  and  love.    The  love  in  that  beautiful  story  is  like  a  breath  of  a  sacred  flower.  God  knows  why  all  loves  couldn't  be  like  that.  Dorothy  Bradford  Chiles,  San  Antonio,  Tex.   I  read  that  "A  Farewell  to  Arms"  was  to  be  released  both  with  a  sad  and  a  happy  ending.  Evidently,  the  public  must  be  considered  as  too  tenderly  constituted  to  view  the  original  tragedy  as  Hemingway  wrote  it.  I  resent  this  implication.   Edna  May  E'.vert,  Peabody,  Kansas   ANTICIPATION   No  other  Hollywood  actor  could  have  been  better  suited  to  the  role  of  the  gentlemanly  tough  in  "Night  After  Night,"  than  George  Raft.  I  can  hardly  wait  until  I  have  an  opportunity  to  see  him  in  "Under-cover  Man,"  with  Nancy  Carroll.  I  just  know  it's  going  to  be  good.   And  I'm  simply  squealing  for  more  Raft  interviews,  and  bigger  and  better  Raft  por-  traits in  Photoplay.   Lucile  Bull,  Tampa,  Florida   I  think  Nancy  Carroll  is  one  of  the  screen's  best  performers,  as  well  as  a  sparkling  beauty  with  an  amazing  personality.  She  was  grand  in  "Hot  Saturday,"  and  in  her  more  recent  production,  "Under-cover  Man,"  she  played  the  role  of  Nora  superbly.   A  combination  of  just  enough  sophistica-  tion and  just  enough  sweetness.  I  always  eagerly  await  Nancy's  films.   Richard  Parlier,  Charlotte,  N.  C.   WELCOME  BACK,  CLARA    "FLESH"   In  my  opinion,  Wallace  Beery  is  one  of  the  most  natural  actors  on  the  screen  today.  His  work  in  "Flesh"  deserves  high  praise.  No  other  actor  could  have  played  the  part  of  Polikai  so  ably  as  Beery.  Name  him  "King  of  Movieland."   Betty  La  Fond,  Indianapolis,  Ind.   What's  the  idea  of  making  Ricardo  Cortez  play  second  fiddle  to  Wallace  Beery  in  "Flesh"?  Ricci  doesn't  have  to  play  second  fiddle  to  anybody.  He's  versatile,  and  can  act.  He's  got  a  better  profile  than  a  certain  actor  who  seems  to  be  sublimely  unaware  that  his  profile  has  slipped  ages  ago.  Ladies  dream  about  Ricci,  men  like  him.  Give  him  a  hand,  he's  not  afraid  of  work.   Edwina  Green,  Baltimore,  Md.   MICKEY  ENDEARS  ALL  MICE   This  is  perhaps  a  different  type  of  reader-  comment,  for  it  is  about  the  Star  of  Stars!  We  moved  to  this  place  in  the  country,  and  the  house  was  old  and  at  night  we  couldn't  sleep  for  the  scampering  and  scratching  of  mice.  Not  caring  for  cats,  I  bought  mouse  traps.  After  that  I  would  lie  awake  nights  waiting  for  the  deadly  click  of  the  traps,  and  thinking  of  all  the  joy  and  laughter  Mickey  Mouse  had  brought  to  the  world,  and  I  felt  as  guilty  as  a  criminal.   Mrs.  E.  Pritchard,  Taylorton,  Sask.,  Can.   Mickey  Mouse's  fame  will  never  die.  His  antics  in  Disney's  animated  cartoons  make  for  radiant   happiness.     He   takes  you   into   the   [  PLEASE  TURN  TO  PAGE  12  ]    interested  in  an  Oriental  portrayal.  My  sin-  cere wish  is  that  you  either  continue  giving  us  such  fine  characterizations  or,  if  it  is  not  possible  to  equal  "The  Bitter  Tea  of  General  Yen,"  let  Oriental  pictures  rest  forever.   Mary  J.  Tracht,  Shelby,  Ohio   "Smilin'  Through,"  that  perfect  screen  drama,  left  me  all  aglow  with  emotions  that  seem  to  have  been  slumbering  for  many  years.  I  felt  deeply  moved  and  inspired.   Norma  Shearer  must  be  very  proud  of  this  latest  of  her  accomplishments.  In  it  she  proves  her  versatility  as  an  actress.   Of  the  performances  of  Fredric  March  and  Leslie  Howard  enough  cannot  be  said  in  praise.   Mrs.  Jesse  W.  Koch,  Lynbrook,  L.  I.   PyEANS  TO  "A  FAREWELL  TO  ARMS"   It  didn't  matter  that  I  was  twenty-five  minutes  late,  that  I  forgot  my  car  was  parked  on  a  "one-way"  street,  that  the  detour  cost  me  fifteen  precious  minutes  in  which  I  man-  aged to  run  into  a  car,  and  that  my  husband  was  a  little  tired  of  waiting.  Nothing  mat-  tered.   The  reason?    I  was  still  in  a  different  world,   remembering   as   I   shall   always,   the   superb   performance   of  Helen   Hayes,   Gary   Cooper   and  Adolphe  Menjou  in  "A  Farewell  to  Arms."   Gladys  Carpenter,  Springfield,  Mass.   Movies  good  and  bad  I've  seen,  but  the  finest  one  was  "A  Farewell  to  Arms,"  with  Gary  Cooper  and  Helen  Hayes.  That  story  with  such  two  fine  actors  can  actually  make    The  great  question  of  the  season  has  been,  "Can  Clara  come  back?"  Now,  "Call  Her  Savage"  has  appeared,  and  the  almost  unanimous  verdict  has  been  "Yes!"   I  think  Clara's  success  isdue  to  the  fact  that  she  represents  the  type  of  girl  every  young  woman  wants  to  be  and  every  young  man  wants  for  a  sweetheart — lovely  and  lovable,  full  of  fun  and  pep.  She  represents  Eternal  Youth!  Mrs.  Mary  E.  Rodney,  Boston,  Mass.   Keep  up  the  good  work  and  the  world  will  bow  down  to  the  "Great  Bow,"  and  no  "Gar"  prefixed  to  it,  either.   Mrs.  Aileen  Leffler,  Louisville,  Ky.   Call  her  savage?  Well,  I  declare.  What's  become  of  the  little  savage  sailor  girl  who  used  to  tame  the  United  States  Navy  as  easily  as  Barney  Google's  Sully  tames  wrestling  come-  ons?   Say,  mister,  who  is  that  sweet  little  girl  that  looks  at  you  so  innocently?  Where's  my  old  sweetheart,  where's  the  savage  lady?  Yes,  that's  what  I  mean,  where  oh  where  is  Clara  Bow?   Ed  W.  Steinbrenner,  Sioux  City,  Iowa   Connie  Bennett  and  Kay  Francis  may  wear  beautiful  gowns  but  they  had  better  watch  out  for  our  Clara.  She  may  take  the  name  of  Hollywood's  best-dressed  woman.   M.  D.  Reisbeck,  Denver,  Colo.   Why,  oh  why,  did  Clara  dress  in  sleek  "Kay  Francis"  clothes?  Bow  is  no  Norma  Shearer,  nor  can  she  emulate  Kay  Francis  in  dress.  But  how  she  does  wear  underwear!  Better  than  Alice  White!   Mrs.  Belle  Kurland,  Denver,  Colo.    George  Raft  and  Nancy  Carroll —  teamed  with  him  in  "Under-  cover Man" — demonstrate  the  work  which  is  drawing  George  lots  of  notice.  One  reader  would  like  to  kill  two  birds  with  one  stone,  by  having  George  do  a    screen    life    of    Valentino    10    Photoplay  Magazine  for  March,  1933    ^    I  I    m    <&  BIG  CAGE   ■  CLYDE  BEAUT    ANITA  PAGE   *   ANDY  DEVINE  .RAYMOND  HATTON  *  VINCE  BARNETT   ICKEY  ROONEY    *    WALLACE  FORD   •   No  man  in.  history  ever  threw  forty  lions  and   timers  into  one  cage,  then  jumped  in   /with  ana  controlled  them.

Bouquets  for  Mickey   prove   that   his   antics    still   amuse  young   and   old    land  of  unreality  in  which  he  lives — where  simple  objects  are  transformed  into  very  elegant  ones.  Mickey's  one  comedian  that  invariably  evokes  a  good  hearty  laugh  from  his  audience.   Adrienne  Warfield,  Boston,  Mass.   ADDS  INTEREST   To  me  the  most  satisfying  improvement  in  recent  pictures  is  the  one  of  the  company  that  gives  the  cast  at  the  end  of  the  picture  as  well  as  in  the  beginning.  I  am  sure  many  people  like  myself  have  noticed  the  particularly  fine  work  of  a  supporting  member  of  the  cast  and  wondered  all  through  the  performance  who  it  was;  but  not  wishing  to  stay  till  the  picture  was  shown  again  have  left  the  theater  with  the  feeling  that  the  evening  was  not  quite  a  hundred  per  cent.  I  sincerely  wish  that  all  the  companies  would  adopt  this  idea.   Jeanette  L.  Bell,  Springdale,  Conn.   AN  INDELIBLE  MEMORY   The  memory  of  the  never-to-be-forgotten  performance  of  Jeanne  Eagels  cannot  but  burden  the  brilliant  young  actress  who  is  giving  us  a  new  Sadie  and  who  is  doing  it  splendidly!  All  hail  to  Joan  Crawford!  Her  Sadie  arouses  your  sympathy,  stirs  your  emotions,  and  compels  your  highest  respect  and  admiration  for  this  indomitable  actress  who  is  fast  ascending  the  heights  of  screen-  dom.  Were  it  not  for  the  lingering  memory  of  that  other  Sadie,  the  character  that  Miss  Crawford  gives  us  would  be  enough  to  bring  her  any  awards  the  screen  may  have  to  offer.  Catherine  Newton,  Minneapolis,  Minn.   I  have  just  seen  "Rain."  Never  has  Joan  Crawford  given  us  such  a  colorless  performance.   12    season?    My,  how  we  used  to  enjoy  the  old  pantomimes!   Mary  dear,  instead  of  hunting  around  for  stories,  why  not  give  us  Cinderella,  Jack  and  the  Beanstalk,  etc.,  and  go  down  in  history  as  one  of  the  great  actresses  on  the  screen,  where  we  could  take  the  children  always  to  see  something  truly  fine?  Elizabeth  Ellenberg,  San  Francisco,  Calif.   PRACTICAL  FASHION  HINTS   I  have  a  grown-up  daughter  and  I  fashion  all  her  wardrobe.  We  study  the  styles  each  month  in  the  Photoplay  and  in  all  modern  pictures  on  the  screen,  and  I  copy  any  that  are  practical  for  our  use.  And  so  for  a  very  small  sum,  my  daughter  has  clothes  that  are  different  and  entirely  up  to  the  minute.  Mrs.  John  Potts,  New  Albany,  Ind.   FILM  VERSIONS  OF  BOOKS   Though  some  people  have  an  emphatic  dis-  taste for  movie  versions  of  books  they  have  read,  I  seldom  go  to  movies  except  to  see  just  such  a  picture.  "Anna  Karenina,"  "A  Con-  necticut Yankee  in  King  Arthur's  Court,"  "Lorna  Doone,"  "Lady  of  the  Lake,"  "So  Big,"  "Resurrection,"  "Arrowsmith"  and  "Camille"  are  but  a  few  stories  that  have  sur-  vived that  acid  test  for  me.  Despite  the  fact  that  all  these  stories  when  filmed  were  not  absolutely  identical  with  the  originals,  I  found  them  interesting.  The  changes  were  so  slight  that  I  could  revive  faded  memories  of  the  original,  which  I  had  usually  read  long  before.  Then,  too,  those  changes  lent  new  suspense  to  the  original  plot.   E.  Cortelyou,  Columbus,  O.    Walter  Huston,  with  his  marvelous  tech-  nique, far  outshines  Joan.  Nevertheless,  I  am  patiently  waiting  to  see  Joan  exploit  her  dramatic  powers  in  "Today  We  Live."   Mrs.  Frank  Karras,  Detroit,  Mich   "MAEDCHEN  IN  UNIFORM"   I  have  just  seen  a  movie  audience  literally  plucked  from  its  seat  and  set  down  in  far-  distant  Prussia.  I  have  seen  it  sit  silently  at  the  end  of  a  picture  still  unable  to  dissolve  itself  into  the  world  as  housewives,  steno-  graphers, business  men  and  school  children.   "Maedchen  in  Uniform"  has  set  a  new  level  of  artistic  and  beautiful  cinematic  work.  Strangely  enough,  it  is  entirely  the  product  of  women,  written,  directed  and  acted  entirely  by  members  of  the  feminine  sex.  And  what  is  more  astonishing,  one  doesn't  miss  the  men.  Although  the  dialogue  is  in  German,  the  audience  is  easily  able  to  follow  the  story  from  the  eloquently  expressive  acting.   Ann  Bodine,  University  City,  Mo.   WE  WANT  LEE!   I  think  some  one  ought  to  put  the  public  wise  to  keep  an  eye  on  this  boy,  Lee  Tracy,  who  gives  such  a  perfect  performance  in  "Doctor  X."  Here,  folks,  is  a  real  genius.  For  fine  acting  ability,  Tracy  has  them  all  taking  a  back  seat.  He's  no  John  Gilbert  or  Robert  Montgomery  when  it  comes  to  looks,  but  can  that  boy  hold  his  own  in  acting!  Dorothy  Hafemeister,  Oshkosh,  Wis.   A  LETTER  TO  MARY   A  hint  to  the  Queen  of  the  movies.  The  only  Mary  Pickford!  Why  are  our  fairy  stories  not  filmed  at  the  Christmas  holiday    Opinions  still  differ — mightily —  about  Joan  Crawford's  work  in  "Rain."  Some  say  "fine"  and  some  shake  their  heads.  It  may  help  your  decision  on  Joan's  ability,  to  glimpse  her  at  work  in  her  latest  picture,  "Today  We  Live,"  with  Robert  Young    Photoplay  Magazine  for  March,  1933    J3    H e d  chapped  hands   mucie  smooth  cmd  Wmte  Lfi  <S  ami/s !    s    oreness  relieved  instantly    EVERY  TIME  you  wash  dishes,  clothes,  peel  vegetables,  clean  with  harsh  alkali  cleansers  or  put  your  hands  in  hot  water,  you  dry  out  the  precious  protecting  oils  in  your  skin.   The  skin  then  roughens  and  if  exposed  to  winter  weather,  chaps  and  cracks  open .  Hands  then  become  so  unsightly  they  seem  fairly  to  shout  "housework!"  to  all  who  see  them.  And  often  they're  so  painful  you  almost  want  to  cry.   But  now,  with  a  dainty  chiffon-  weight  cream  you  can  instantly  put  back  the  natural  lubricating  oils  in  your  skin — and  secure  immediate  relief  from  all  pain.  The  moment  you  apply  it,  your  hands  actually  feel  soft  and  soothed.  It's  almost  like  magic!   And  in  3  days  the  skin  is  complete-  ly healed  —  without  a  sign  of  those  rough,  ugly  cracks,  those  swollen  knuckles,  that  dry  chapped  scaliness.    Does  not  dry  the  skin   This  dainty  liquid  is  called  Hinds  Honey  and  Almond  Cream.  It  is  not  a  weak,  thinned-out  lotion.  It  is  not  a  thick,  gummy  jelly.  Such  preparations  often  contain  ex-  cessive drying  substances  that  coarsen  and  parch  the  skin.  Hinds  is  entirely  different  — a  delicate,  chiffon-weight  cream  that  is  gratefully  absorbed  by  the  dry,  thirsty  pores.  Hinds  actually  leaves  an  invisible  "second  skin"  that  acts  as  a  constant  pro-  tection to  your  hands.   Thousands  of  housewives,  business  girls,  sportsmen  and  outdoor  playing  youngsters,  from  coast  to  coast,  depend  on  this  simple  method  to  keep  their  hands  smooth  and  comfortable.

Substantial,  Salutary,  Savory  J    r    THESE    crackling,    bleak,    winter  days,  when  a  cozy  kitchen  is  a  pleasant  place  to  be,  are  certainly  the  opportune  time  to  experiment  with  new  dishes.    And  why  not  try  something  that  will  appeal  to  the  male  members  of  the  family,  as  well  as  test  your  culinary  skill.     Simple  recipes  requiring  just  that  added  something  to  make  them  seem  quite  novel.   Wally  Beery's  special  at  the  Brown  Derby,  famous  Holly-  wood restaurant,  is  onion  soup.    Here's  the  chef's  own  recipe.   Onion  Soup   Method:  Slice  two  large  onions  and  saute  in  a  skillet,  using  a  generous  amount  of  butter.  When  they  are  brown  add  a  quart  of  rich  chicken  broth.  Heat  thoroughly  and  season  to  taste.  Pour  in  individual  soup  bowls,  and  place  half  a  French  roll  on  top.  Sprinkle  a  tablespoon  of  grated  Parmesan  cheese  on  top  of  each  roll  and  brown  under  the  broiler  flame  for  five  minutes.     Enough  for  six  servings.   Henry's,  another  of  the  film  center's  eating  places,  special-  izes in  German  and  Hungarian  repasts.    Among  them  is  one  of  Charlie    Chaplin's   favorite  dishes:    Never  was  there  such  delicious  onion  soup  as  that  "brewed"  in  the  Brown  Derby  kitchen,   saith  Wallace   Beery    Sauerbratex   4  lbs.  beef — chuck  or  rump   2  onions,  sliced   1  ts.  peppercorns   3  bay  leaves   3  cups  vinegar  1  cup  water  }4  cup  sugar   4  ginger  snaps   First,  sprinkle  the  meat  with  salt  and  pepper.  Place  with  the  onions,  bay  leaves,  pepper-  corns and  ginger  snaps  in  a  deep  earthen  bowl.  Add  water  and  vinegar.     Meat  must  be   16    covered  by  the  liquid.  Then  cover  your  bowl,  put  it  in  a  cool  place  and  let  stand  four  days.   Now  take  out  meat  and  place  in  an  iron  kettle,  in  which  you  have  let  out  some  fat.  Brown  it  on  all  sides.  Add  a  little  of  the  spiced  vinegar.  Then  put  on  a  tight-fitting  cover  and  allow  to  cook  slowly  for  three  hours,  or  until  tender.  Gradually  add  more  of  the  liquid  in  which  the  meat  has  stood,  whenever  necessary  while  cooking.   When  done,  remove  meat,  skim  off  fat  in  kettle  and  strain  the  liquid.  Melt  the  sugar  in  an  iron  frying  pan,  add  the  strained  liquor  gradually.  To  this  you  may  also  add  a  teaspoon  or  two  of  flour,  if  you  like  your  gravy  a  bit  thick.    Cook  until  smooth.   This  may  appear  to  be  a  complicated  process,  but  is  really  very  simple  and  not  nearly  so  arduous  a  task  as  it  may  seem  before  giving  it  a  trial.

She  is  stunning  here,  in  three  entirely  different  costumes:  white  lace  for  evening,  simply  and  beauti-  fully cut;  silver  fox,  most  precious  of  furs,  on  a  sophisticated  afternoon  ensemble ;  and  the  severest  of  tailleurs  for  country  or  morning   in    town.    It  is  difficult  to  get  fitted  smartly  today  unless  you  have  a  good  figure.  For  cur-  rent styles  emphasize  gentle  curves.  Those  whose  measurements  are  a  bit  generous  are  sharply  restricted  in  the  things  they  can  select.   So,  many  of  us  hasten  to  reduce.  Diet  and  exercise  are  both  necessary.  Meals  should  contain  adequate  "bulk"  to  pre-  vent faulty  elimination.  Otherwise  eyes  may  lose  their  sparkle.  Skins  become  sallow.    Wrinkles  appear.   Today  you  may  obtain  this  necessary  "bulk"  by  eating  a  delicious  cereal.  Lab-  oratory tests  show  that  Kellogg's  All-  Bran  supplies  "bulk"  as  well  as  vitamin  B  and  food-iron.  This  "bulk"  is  similar  to  that  of  leafy  vegetables.   Enjoy  All-Bran  as  a  cereal  with  milk — or  use  in  cooking.  Two  table-  spoonfuls  daily  are  usually  sufficient.  Isn't  this  much  pleasanter,  much  safer  than  taking  patent  medicines?    Kellogg's  All-Bran  is  not  fattening.  It  helps  satisfy  hunger  without  adding  many  calories  to  the  diet.

Because  fats  are  fuel . . .  sugar  is  the  flame.  Late  dietetic  discoveries  prove  that.  You  actually  lose  that  excess  poundage  faster  with  the  right  sweet  at  the  right  time.   But  what  is  the  best  sweet  for  slen-  derizing? That's  the  secret  .  .  .  and  its  name  is  "Life  Savers."  I  prescribe  Life  Savers  to  all  my  clients  because  they  are  a  purposeful  candy,  for  re-  ducing.

Close-Ups  and  Long-Shots    MIRACLE  of  miracles!  At  last  one  writer  is  satisfied  that  Hollywood  has  done  right  by  his  brain  child.  Noel  Coward,  distinguished  author  of  the  stage  play  "Cavalcade,"  is  jubilant  over  the  screen  version  and  has  congratulated  the  ex-  ecutives of  the  Fox  Company,  its  producers.  Rather  a  relief — is  it  not? — after  that  parade  of  malcontents-  outstanding  members  of  which  were  Theodore  Dreiser  ("An  American  Tragedy")  and  Ernest  Hemingway  ("A  Farewell  to  Arms").   Possibly  Coward's  opus  was  fool-proof.  However,  I  do  not  believe  that  this  is  the  explanation.  Coward  is  a  most  skilful  craftsman,  and  it  was  obviously  easier  and  better  to  follow  the  author's  plot,  rather  than  to  attempt  to  find  some  substitute.  The  case  of  "Caval-  cade" leads  me  to  suspect  that  authors  are  sometimes  right  and  that  picture  producers  are  not  always  wrong.   THE  fad  for  burning  glances  and  hot,  tempestuous  passions  is  definitely  on  the  wane.  The  Latin  lover  type— at  least  the  imported  variety — has  been  displaced  by  the  "made  in  England"  brand,  curiously  restrained  in  its  amours.  These  English  actors  have  their  own  notion  of  how  a  man  in  love  should  deport  himself  toward  the  lady.  And  the  members  of  the  fair  sex  that  attend  the  movies  are  inexpressibly  surprised  and  delighted  with  the  change.   The  box-office  appeal  of  such  finished  English  actors  as  Leslie  Howard  and  Herbert  Marshall  hurried  the  process  already  in  operation.  I  believe,  however,  that  the  American  motion  picture  public  is  not  sold  on  English  actors  as  such,  but  that  they  sense  in  them  a  refinement  and  subtlety  in  performance  that  perhaps  have  too  often  been  lacking  in  the  general  run  of  screen  players.   Motion  picture  patrons  have  grown  more  discrimin-  ating and  have  learned  not  only  to  appreciate  but  to  demand  those  nuances  in  acting  that  the  more  sophisticated  audiences  of  theatrical  centers  have  long  not  only  expected,  but  demanded,  of  the  stage.   THE  "Buy  American"  movement  may  or  may  not  affect  the  motion  picture  industry.    Many  of  the  foreign-born  motion  picture  actors  are  beginning  to  wonder    whether   the   idea   may    result    in    bias   for  American  actors  only.  Hollywood  studios  are  extraordinarily  cosmopolitan,    and  a  number  of  old  and  rising  foreign  favorites  might  conceivably  find  no  call  for  their  services  in  the  face  of  a  united  pro-American  front.  It  could  easily  be  argued  that  neither  art  nor  artist  knows  any  nation-  ality. But  argument  is  often  futile  in  the  face  of  popular  movements.  When,  however,  such  a  picture  as  "Cavalcade" — British  through  and  through —  meets,  as  it  is  doing,  so  tremendous  a  response  from  American  motion  picture  patrons,  it  does  not  seem  likely  that  the  many  British  actors  in  the  cast  are  in  danger  of  abruptly  losing  favor.   Such  discrimination  would,  in  the  long  run,  do  us  more  harm  than  good.  American  films  might  be  boy-  cotted in  foreign  markets.   While  Russian  gasoline  continues  to  sell  in  enor-  mous quantities  in  the  United  States,  it  would  seem  rather  absurd  for  us  to  turn  upon  actors  whose  only  offense  is  that  they  are  not  American-born.    WHAT  does  the  public  want?"  Producers  and  exhibitors  have  attempted  to  answer  this  question  since  the  beginning  of  the  motion  picture  industry.  A  very  well-known  mid-western  exhibitor  makes  these  recommendations:   "One — let  the  men  who  nursed  this  business  from  the  days  of  the  old  nickelodeon  to  the  dawn  of  the  talkie  determine  the  type  of  picture  to  be  made.  Send  the  intellectuals,  the  sophisticates  and  highbrows  who  have  nothing  but  supercilious  scorn  for  this  industry,  back  home.   "Two — quit  worshipping  the  stage;  cease  looking  to  it  as  a  chief  source  for  material,  inspiration  and  tech-  nique.   "Three — in  the  field  of  current  literature  pay  less  attention  to  'Best-Sellers'  and  more  to  'Best  Renters'  and  regardless  of  whether  it  is  'Best'  in  either  class —  film  it  only  if  it  can  be  filmed — and  then  let  it  be  adapted  only  by  a  person  intimately  acquainted  with  movie  audiences.   "Four — cease  making  celluloid  novels  and  trans-  planted stage  plays — make  movies."   Unfortunately,  these  "recommendations"  do  not  solve  the  problem  of  "what  the  public  wants."  Motion  pictures,  taken  over  from  stage  plays,  often  are  successes;  "highbrow"  films  make  a  hit  with  the  "masses";  while  many  a  "lowbrow"  offering  is  scorned  alike  by  "intellectuals"  and  "the  common  people."   27    No,  there  is  no  formula,  no  pattern.  Each  new  studio  release  must,  in  the  nature  of  things,  inevitably  be  a  gamble.  Not  even  the  public  itself  can  tell  beforehand  what  it  wants.     It  must  see  to  know.    THIS  incident,  which  occurred  during  the  making  of  a  picture  at  Paramount,  is  only  typical  of  the  care  given  children  in  the  studios.   A  member  of  the  cast  uttered  a  profane  word  before  little  Philip  Horimoto.  The  teacher  employed  by  the  board  of  education  to  be  constantly  with  the  child  on  the  set  remonstrated,  and  the  offender  expressed  his  regrets,  but  the  next  day  he  forgot  himself  again.  Whereupon  the  teacher  called  a  taxicab,  took  the  child  home,  leaving  a  waiting  motion  picture  company  flat.  While  overhead  mounted,  the  teacher  presented  the  case  to  the  board  of  education,  which  upheld  her  act.  The  company  was  out  thousands  of  dollars  and  in  a  panic.   Little  Philip  returned  to  work  only  when  a  solemn  guarantee  was  given  that  a  similar  offense  would  never  again  occur  in  his  presence.    TEN  years  ago  Photoplay  published  a  list  of  "The  Twelve  Greatest  Figures  in  Motion  Pictures"  of  that  day.  The  list  had  been  compiled  by  one  of  the  leading  trade  journals  devoted  to  films.  As  Photoplay  explained,  "The  selections  were  made,  not  from  the  standpoint  of  popularity,  but  in  an  effort  to  decide  on  the  people  who  have  had  the  greatest  influence  and  have  done  the  most  effective  work  toward  the  im-  provement of  the  screen."  Mary  Pickford  was  the  only  woman  in  the  list.   David  War];  Griffith,  Director-producer — Because  he  was  the  first  director  to  take  the  screen  seriously,  creating  the  greatest  number  of  useful  innovations  in  production.   Samuel  L.  Rothafel,  Exhibitor — Because  he  was  the  first  to  work  at  a  vision  of  the  great  entertainment  possibilities  of  the  world's  best  music  with  pictures.   Adolph  Zukor,  President  of  Paramount  Pictures —  Because  his  organization,  due  largely  to  his  business  genius  and  insight,  has  assisted  in  the  financial  stabilization  of  pictures.   George  Eastman,  President  Eastman  Kodak  Com-  pany— Because  of  his  dependable  production  of  the  fundamental  physical  supplies;  and  his  Eastman  Theater  at  Rochester,  New  York.   Mary  Pickford,  Actress-producer — Because  she  was  the  first  big  box-office  attraction  and  because  she  has  made  a  sincere  effort  to  keep  faith  with  her  public.  |  Charles  Chaplin,  Actor,  director,  producer — Because,  judged  by  all  the  scientific  standards  of  genius,  he  is  the  one  genius  the  motion  picture  has  directly  pro-  duced.   Douglas  Fairbanks,  Actor-producer — Because  he  abandoned  an  established  type  of  product  and  gambled  in  bigger  things,  through  a  desire  to  make  better  pictures.   Thomas  Alva  Edison,  Inventor — Because  he  evolved    the  one  workable  method  of  making  motion  pictures,  thus  making  the  films  possible  as  a  business.   William  A.  Johnston,  Editor  "Motion  Picture  News"  — Because  he  created  and  developed  a  high  type  of  trade  journal,  and  has  endeavored  to  maintain  it  honestly  and  fearlessly.   Will  H.  Hays,  Director-general  of  the  film  industry —  Because  he  has  focussed  public  attention  on  pictures;  because  he  led  the  victory  in  the  Massachusetts  censor-  ship battle.   ./.  D.  Williams,  Executive — Because  he  organized  First  National,  which  brought  the  exhibitor  in  closer  touch  with  the  producer.   Cecil  B.  DeMille,  Director — Because  he  is  one  of  the  best  optical  reporters  of  our  time,  combining  artistry  and  entertainment;  because  he  has  made  many  stars.   TWO  of  the  twelve — Eastman  and  Edison — have  passed  away;  Griffith's  name  has  lost  its  magic,  and  some  of  the  others,  for  reasons  due  largely  to  changing  conditions,  are  not  of  the  importance  they  enjoyed  when  this  list  was  first  published.  Rothafel  still  sits  in  the  seats  of  the  mighty.  Radio  City  — but  recently  opened — is  a  monument  to  his  energy  and  imagination.  Will  Hays  remains  the  over-lord  of  the  industry,  and  DeMille  one  of  the  great  directors.  Pickford,  Chaplin  and  Fairbanks  continue  as  inter-  national figures.   Who  would  essay  to  pick  the  dozen  great  ones  of  today?  A  difficult  task,  indeed,  far  more  difficult  than  was  the  case  only  a  decade  ago.   THEY  learn  young.  The  other  day,  Joan  Bennett  laid  out  some  shopping  money  on  her  dresser  and  imagine  her  surprise  to  see  her  little  daughter,  Ditty,  just  four,  walk  into  the  breakfast  room  with  the  money  in  her  hand.   "  Why,  Ditty,"  Joan  said,  "where  did  you  get  that?"  "Oh,  at  the  studio,"  said  Ditty,  tossing  her  littlehead.  "  They've  got  lots  of  it  to  give  away  for  just  nothing."  And  Joan  nearly  passed  out.   IT  isn't  the  high  powered  press-agents  or  publicity  ballyhoo  that  always  does  the  stars  the  most  good.  Not  always.  For  instance,  in  a  small  Hollywood  beauty  shop  the  other  day,  a  customer  firmly  an-  nounced that  her  favorite  movie  person  was  Richard  Barthelmess.   "I'm  for  him  because  he's  square,"  the  woman  said.  "I  live  near  his  chauffeur.  They  live  in  a  little  flat  near  my  home.  And  in  all  this  depression,  that  chauffeur  has  never  had  one  cut,  or  been  laid  off  without  wages  while  Mr.  Barthelmess  is  away.  All  the  other  servants  have  been  treated  with  the  same  fairness  and  consideration.  And  a  man  who  treats  his  servants  honestly  and  fairly,  is  good  enough  for  me  on  the  screen."   And  the  half  dozen  customers  hurried  out  to  tell  their  friends  about  Richard  Barthelmess.

CAMAY    THE      SOAP      OF      BEAUTIFUL      WOMEN    Which  M    ovie    Star    Here  are  a  few  great  favorites  among  masculine  screen  person-  alities. Each,  to  our  mind,  has  a  million  dollars'  worth  of  out-  standing, vibrant  "feminine  appeal."  We've  classified  them  according  to  type.  Then  we  analyzed  their  separate  appeals,  and  found,  to  our  surprise,  that  we'd  discovered  a  lot  of  secrets  about  you  women  who  admire  them.  What  do  you  think  about  this?  We'd  like  to  have  your  opinion.    THE  EDITOR.   WE'VE  been  suppressing  a  little  theory  of  our  own  with  considerable  effort  for  some  time  past.  It's  all  about  why  we  think  a  certain  type  of  woman  goes  all  weak-kneed  and  trusting  when  Clark  Gable  sets  his  teeth  and  flashes  an  electro-magnetic  dimple  in  her  direction.   Or  why  another  type  forgets  about  the  roast  that's  burning,  or  that  she  promised  little  Tommy  to  take  him  to  the  zoo  this  afternoon,  when  Leslie  Howard  starts  to  make  love  in  that  half-  serious,  half-whimsical  manner  of  his.   When  we  couldn't  keep  our  pet  theory  on  our  chests  any  longer,  we  threw  on  last  year's  copy  of  an  Agnes  hat  and  rushed  off  to  consult  a  real  authority  on  the  subject.   The  authority  in  question  was  Dr.  John  B.  Watson,  eminent  American  behaviorist  psychologist.  Really  not  half  so  fearful  as  it  sounds!    Dr.  Watson  has  spent  years  and  years  compiling  proofs  that  human  behavior  is  not  such  a  queer,  unpredictable  thing  as  some  people  would  have  us  believe.   According  to  Dr.  Watson,  there  are  certain  primal  responses  in  men  and  women — responses  which  definitely  explain  why  a  certain  type  of  woman  is  strongly  attracted  to,  say,  Ronald  Colman,  and  reacts  about  as  violently  to  Johnny  Weissmuller  as  she  would  to  her  Aunt  Tabitha's  Maltese  cat.   Now,  these  basic,  potent  motives  for  the  attractions  between  men  and  women  literally  knock  in  the  head  all  those  old  village  axioms,  such  as:   "Opposites  attract,"  or  "There's  no  accounting  for  tastes,"  or  "Love  is  blind."  And  a  hundred  others,  just  as  scien-  tifically unsound.   After  I  finish  telling  you  his  ideas  and  add  a  few  of  my  own  gratis,  you  might  let  Photoplay  know  whether  we've  typed  you  correctly.   It's  quite  possible,  of  course,  that  you  fit  our  description  of  the  woman  who  would  desert  home  and  fireside  and  all  the  nice,  safe  things  of  life  after  just  one  good,  resounding  smack  from  that  hardy  fellow,  Jimmy  Cagney.  Yet  Jimmy  might  actually  leave  you  as  chill  as  the  peak  of  Mont  Blanc.  While,  in  reality,  young,  sort-of-fragile  "appeal-to-your-mother-in-  stinct"  Charlie  Farrell  or  Eric  Linden  could  do  things  to  that    Photomontage  by  Lazarnick    D    ominates    You.    By  Hi  I  a  ry   Lyn  n    well    capricious  feminine  nature  of  yours  that  were  ,  positively  .  .  .  well,  just  positively  .  .  .   !   But  speaking  psychologically  and  very  generally,  there  are  two  broad  classifications  into  which  most  normal  women  will  fall:   Those  who  want  to  be  dominated  by  their  men.   Those  who  want  to  do  the  dominating.   Women  who  want  to  be  possessed.  Or  women  who  want  to  possess.   MIND  you,  when  we  say  dominate,  we  don't  mean  the  "  step-  on-'em,  wipe-up-the-floor-with-'em"  kind  of  thing.  Oh,  we're  being  much  more  subtle  than  that.  Often  the  subconscious  impulse  to  get  the  upper  hand  is  softened  into  a  mere  desire  to  "protect."   Have  you  ever  noticed,  for  example,  that  there  are  certain  women — and  certain  men,  too.  for  that  matter — who,  when  in  love  or  attracted  to  someone  of  the  opposite  sex,  actually  seem  to  enjoy  suffering!    Sounds  odd,  doesn't  it?   Yet  this  is  a  very  normal  instinct,  to  be  found  in  women  who  want  to  be  mastered.  Who  want  to  be  completely  over-pow-  ered by  a  dominant  male  personality.  Who  desire  to  know  definitely  that  they're  yielding!   The  highbrows  call  this  impulse  masochism.    And  its  oppo-    site— the  impulse  to   inflict    the   suffering — is   called   sadism.   I  saw  "Flesh"  a  while  ago,  a  picture  that  seemed  made  to  explain  this  type  of  "suffering"  female  adoration.  The  girl,  Karen  Morley,  was  madly  infatuated  with  a  slick  guy  (Ricardo  Cortez).  She  knew  he  was  using  her  for  his  own  ulterior  pur-  poses. She  knew  he  was  "yellow."  She  allowed  him  to  beat  her.  And  hating  herself  for  it,  she  continued  to  love  him  and  follow  out  his  crooked  instructions.  Why?  Obviously,  he  had  that  fatal  fascination  of  the  masterful  male  for  her.  And  she  was  obviously  the  type  of  woman  who  desired  to  be  enslaved!   And  do  you  remember  the  amazing  popularity  of  Fannie  Brice's  song:  "My  Man"?  Of  course!  That's  the  way  any  number  of  women  want  their  men.  If  it  weren't  recognized  as  true,  do  you  suppose  for  a  minute  that  vaudeville  managers  would  continue  to  engage  those  "sensational  Apache  dancers,  straight  from  the  heart  of  Montmartre"?  That  "we  love  to  suffer"  business  has  a  widespread  appeal  that  any  clever  show-  man recognizes!   Well,  then,  does  your  heart  burn  for  Clark  Gable?  Or  expand  to  the  bursting  point  at  the  approach  of  Chester  Morris?  Go  all  tight  and  constricted  at  the  thought  of  Jimmy  Cagney?  Do  a  double  flip-flop  for  Johnny  Weissmuller?    Well,  then  .  .  .!   Now  comes  a  much  subtler  example  of  the  masterful  male.

A  trapeze  act,  tea  for  two  and  a  wrestling  match  all  in  one.  A  smack  'em  down  and  kiss  'em  quick.  In  fact,  it's  a  riot.  A  downright  riot  with  everyone  joining  hands  and  coming  in  on  the  chorus  until  no  one  knows  who  started  it  or  what  it  was  all  about  (if  anything)  in  the  first  place.   Dear  me!   When  people  get  mad  in  Podunk,  they  get  normally,  healthily  mad  with  just  cause  and  no  kidding  and  that's  that.  But  in  Hollywood —   First  of  all,  there's  Lupe  Velez.  Seems  Lupe  is  con-  5  tantly  getting  herself  into  high  class  feuds.  Her  first  was  with  exotic  Jetta  Goudal  on  "The  Drums  of  Love"  set.   The  fiery  little  Mexican  was  rating  too  much  attention  for  Miss  Goudal's  comfort,  so  Jetta  remarked  in  passing  something  in  Mexican,  and  Lupe  made  an  emphatic  comeback.  And  for  the  next  two  hours  of  her  life  the  calm  and  icy  Goudal  held  off  by  her  strong  white  hands  what  looked  like  a  sure  and  active  threat  of  mayhem.   It  looked  for  a  while  as  if  Miss  Goudal  were  about  to  finish  "  The  Drums  of  Love"  in  small,  fantastic  pieces.  Which  wasn't  what  Mr.  Griffith,  the  director,  had  planned  at  all.   Of  course,  you  remember  the  time  Lupe  wrapped  her  arms  to  the  elbows  in  white  napkins  at  the  Embassy  and  pretended  she  was  Lil  Tashman  in  long,  white  gloves.  And  did  Lil  burn?  Then  there's  Lupe's  take-off  on  her  calm  and  dignified  country  woman,  Dolores  Del  Rio.  With  Dolores  saying  nothing  in  public  but  doing  plenty  of  hot  tamale  thinking.   Things  have  been  just  a  bit  strained  too,  between  the  frank  and  open  Barbara  Stanwyck  and  the  terribly  elegant  Ruth  Chatterton,  since  the  day  Ruthie  walked  onto  the  set  where  Barbara  was  making  her  first  screen  test.  Music  blared,  people  were  flying  about,  and  the  place  seemed  all  atwitter.   32    Lupe  Velez  draped  her  arms  to  the  elbows  in  napkins,  imitating  Tash-  man's  long  white  gloves.  Imagine    Lil's    feelings    "Deah,  oh  deah,"  Ruthie  said,  "is  it  necessary  ("nessry,"  Ruth  pronounces  it)  to  have  all  this  music  and  what-not  while  that  young  lady  makes  a  test?"  Instantly  things  stopped  dead  in  their  sound  track.  "Listen,"  Barbara  said,  and  can't  you  hear  her  say  it?  "I  don't  like  this  music  any  better  than  you.  But  they  want  it,  so  what?"   So  what,  indeed,  as  the  Chinese  say.  At  any  rate,  it's  been  slightly  frigid  in  the  Stanwyck-Chatterton  vicinity  ever  since.   THEN,  of  course,  there's  that  famous  clothes  feud  between  Constance  Bennett  and  Lilyan  Tashman.  And  the  famous  feud  between  Lil  and  Eleanor  Boardman,  when  Lil  criticized  Eleanor's  taste  in  clothes.  And  the  Bennett-Swanson  feud  when  Connie  stepped  in  and  annexed  Gloria's  Marquis  and  her  favorite  movie,  "Rockabye."   And  the  newest,  hottest  Bennett  feud  is  on  right  now  between  Connie  and  the  handsome  Joel  McCrea.  It  seems  Connie  pro-  ceeded to  criticize  Mr.  McCrea  on  the  set.  Joel  calmly  and  deliberately  informed  Miss  Bennett  she  could,  in  fact  did,  get    Hollywood    Coogan  at  their  table  for  lunch  while  "  Skippy"  was  being  made.  They  were  utterly  enchanted  with  the  child.  So  unHollywood  like,  my  dears.     So  unactorish.   "And  don't  you  just  love  making  movies?"   one  woman  cooed.   "Gee,  yes,"  Bobby  piped  up.   "  And  don't  you  just  love  little  Mitzi  Green?  "  another  cooed.  Instantly,  there  was  a  change  in  the  child.    He  laid  down  his  fork  and  glared.     "She's  a  punk  actress,"  Bobby  announced,  and  strode  indignantly  away,  while  six  women  stared  open-  mouthed.     And  flabbergasted.   Oh  yes,  my  hearties.  It's  Hollywood  and  you'll  feud  and  like  it.   There's  one  wretched  family  in  Beverly  Hills  that's  been  the  inno-  cent victim  of  one  of  the  most  hilarious  feuds  known  to  mankind.  It  began  between  Buddy  Rogers  and  Dick  Powell,  the  lad  who  scored  in  "Blessed  Event."    R    Buddy  Rogers  and  Dick  Powell  drove  the  neighbors  crazy  of  nights  in  their  saxophone  duel  over  pretty  Mary  Brian    away  with  that  with  plenty  of  people,  but  not  with  him,  and  to  everyone's  utter  astonishment,  walked  right  out  of  the  picture.  And  the  amazed  and  stunned  Miss  Bennett  was  left  without  a  leading  man.    At  this  writing  the  "mad's"  still  on.   Jimmy  Cagney  and  Eddie  Robinson,  since  their  "Public  Enemy"  and  "Little  Caesar"  hits,  eye  each  other  with^a  slightly  glassy  and  suspicious  eye.  No  gangster  should  try  to  outdo  another  even  if  it  is  just  a  screen  scrap.   And  let  me  whisper  that  Chevalier,  that  Maurice,  thinks  Stu  Erwin  is  the  unfunniest  fellow  he  has  ever  heard  of,  while  Stu  goes  around  mumbling  something  about  darned  Frenchmen  think  they're  cute  and  they're  not.  And  if  "Schnozzle"  Durante  ever  turned  up  that  nose  at  Buster  Keaton  the  way  Jimmy  feels  like  doing,  it  would  call  for  the  lifeboats.    Women  and  children  first.   Oh,  I  tell  you,  every  one  feuds  in  Hollywood.  Even  the  children.  For  instance,  the  Coogans  just  never  see  Mitzi  Green  around.  And  Mitzi  simply  doesn't  know  Jackie  or  Bobby  Coogan  ever  lived.   Some  women  visitors  to  the  Paramount  lot  had  little  Bobbv    »OTH  boys  are  musical.  Both  boys  )have  been  rushing  Mary  Brian.  And  what's  more,  both  boys  live  but  one  house  apart.  Dick  would  take  up  his  saxophone  of  an  evening  and  toot,  "Here  Lies  Love."  Buddy  would  come  right  back  with  his  saxophone,  "Say  It  Isn't  So,"  with  variations.  Then  Dick's  trombone  would  blare  forth,  "19k  Still  Got  a  Dollar"  and  back  would  come  Buddy's  trombone  with  "Brother,  Could  You  Please  ,Spare  a  Dime."  Then  Dick's  flute  would  pipe  out,  "  Pul-leeze,  Mr.  Hemminway,"  until  the  poor  inno-  cent victims  sandwiched  between  them  would  run  screaming  out  sing-  ing, "Let's  Put  Out  the  Lights  and  Go  to  Sleep."   So  on  and  on  the  feud  went.  With  Dick  and  Mary  dancing  somewhere  one  night.  Buddy  and  Mary  dancing  somewhere  the  next  night.  But  Dick  had  one  up  on  Buddy.  He  could  play  the  violin.  Buddy  couldn't.  So  Buddy  hires  himself  a  teacher  and  proceeds  to  learn  violin  playing.   Hollywood  had  no  idea  where  the  thing  would  end  when  a  radio  broadcast  finally  called  Buddy  out  of  town.  He  stood  very  forlornly  in  his  backyard  the  morning  he  left  as  he  mourn-  fully played  toward  Dick's  window,  "I  Surrender,  Dear."

But  after  Joan's  quiet,  sure  rise,  all  moviedom  wonders  which  system  is  better    THAT'S  usually  the  case  with  sis-  ters— two  is  a  crowd.  Especially  is  it  the  case  in  Holly-  wood, where  you  can  count  the  sisters  who  have  triumphed  together  on  the  fingers  of  one  hand.  The  Gish  sisters,  Norma  and  Constance  Talmadge,  Katha-  rine MacDonald  and  Mary  MacLaren,  Viola  Dana  and  Shirley  Mason — these  are  outstanding  and,  currently,  the  Bennetts.   Yes,    currently,    the    Bennetts — Con-  stance and  Joan.     A  contrast  if  there  ever  crowd  by  themselves.   In  fact,  Constance  alone  was  quite -a  crowd  when  Joan  came  quietly  to  Hollywood  and  put  herself  in  the  toughest  spot  an  actress  could  possibly  pick.  Constance,  already  a  star,  was  a  scintillating  queen  of  the  cinema.  She  outshone  a  lot  of  other  stars  who,  dramatically  speaking,  are  quite  as  brilliant  as  she;  especially  spectacular  in  everything  she  was  or  did,  she  dazzled  the  whole  movie  sphere.   And  into  the  shadow  thrown  by  that  glittering  dazzle,  literally  crept  little  sister  Joan.   Joan  probably  didn't  know  it  at  the  time — and  probably  wouldn't  have  let  it  stop  her  if  she  had — but  she  was  attempting  to  do  the  next  to  impossible,  something  which  had  rarely  been  done  before.  She  intended  that  her  own  sun  should  rise  and  shine  in  the  face  of  her  sister's  resplendent  glory.   Perhaps,  if  she  thought  about  it  at  all,  she  thought  that  Constance's  blazing  aurora  might  help  her,  not  realizing  that  it  was  bound  to  be  her  greatest  handicap.   Let's  reminisce  a  little  and  think  how  many  times  that  same  attempt  has  been  made  and  what  usually  happened.  Con-  sider Mary  Pickford,  for  instance,  and  what  happened  to  Lottie.  Consider  Loretta  Young  and  sister  Pollv  Ann.  Con-  sider Lois  Wilson  and  Diana  Kane,  Marian  Marsh  and  Jeanne  Morgan,  Laura  LaPlante  and  sister  Violet — eh,  consider  oodles  and  scads   of   such   examples.      Holly-   3k    Yes  indeed,  when  they  are  sisters.  But  where  others  failed,  Joan  had  the  winning   trick    and    wood  is  full  of  'em,  for  Hollywood,  hitherto,  has  been  almost  entirely  a  one-  to-a-family  town.   Certainly  it  has  been  a  one-sister  town  ever  since  the  time  of  Viola  Dana  and  Shirley  Mason,  and  that  was  a  long,  long  time  ago.  They  were  just  about  the  last  pair  of  sisters  to  come  up  together;  until,  that  is,  Miss  Joan  Bennett  showed  up  on  the  scene.   As  everybody  knows,  Constance,  Bar-  bara and  Joan  are  the  three  daughters  of  Richard  Bennett,  a  sire  of  most  illustrious  name  both  upon  stage  and  screen.  Inasmuch  as  Bennett  pcre  is  an  actor  of  such  excellence,  it  was  perhaps  inevitable  that  his  three  daughters  should  seek  theatrical  careers;  in  the  Bennett  family,  the  stage  is  at  least  as  much  of  a  tradition  as  with  the  Barrymores.   Constance  came,  saw,  conquered — and  how!  Barbara,  after  achieving  something  of  success,  retired  to  raise  babies  as  Mrs.  Morton  Downey.  Joan,  the  infant  of  the  Bennett  menage,  was  the  last  of  the  trio  to  "break  in,"  and  consequently  most  under  the  gun.   NOT  only  was  she  the  last  of  the  three  to  come  to  Holly-  wood, but  before  coming  at  all  she  waitedto  get  unhappily  married  and  happily  divorced,  between  the  two  having  a  baby  of  her  own.  Meanwhile,  Connie  was  shooting  up  and  up  like  an  unloosed  comet.  Thus  Joan  was  at  an  enormous  disadvantage  before  she  ever  got  to  Hollywood.  For  Holly-  wood was  using  about  all  of  its  trumpets  tooting  for  Connie,  and  there  wasn't  any  wind  left  over  for  Joan.  However,  Joan  was  smart.   If  Joan  had  attempted  to  come,  as  Connie  did,  heralded  and  press-agented,  midst  copious  bouquets  and  countless  wardrobe  trunks,  here  might  easily  have  been  a  sad,  sad  story,  mates,  to  relate.     If  she,  too,  had  attempted  to  put  herself  over  as  the   best-dressed  woman  in  the  world,  Rv     7?

In  spite  of  recent  strain  and  difficulties,  she  is  looking  positively  years  younger.    Perhaps  it's  the  English  climate    NO  one  can  picture  Gloria  Swanson  living  a  truly  quiet  stretch  of  existence.  Each  quiet  pause  has  been,  seem-  ingly, merely  an  interlude  between  the  cascade  of  emotions  over  which  she  has  just  tumbled,  and  the  dangerous  whirlpool  looming  ahead.   Gloria  thought  her  marriage  to  Michael  Farmer  and  the  birth  of  her  beautiful  daughter  were  to  bring  that  "happiness  and  peace  forever  after"  which  all  women  believe  they  want.  She  thought  the  same,  of  course,  when  she  married  Wallace  Beery,  Herbert  Somborn  and  the  Marquis  de  la  Falaise.   She  believed  it  when  she  left  Mack  Sennett  for  Paramount;  when  she  repudiated  Paramount  and  twenty  thousand  dollars  a  week    to   produce   her   own  pictures;  when  she  left  Hollywood  to  make  a  picture  in  the         7?  v     T?  11  /  traditional   "quiet  peace''  of  old  England.  J     -**-"*■    Once  Gloria  was  too  busy  with  her  film  work  to  be  able  to  take  many  dinners  with  her  husband.  She  gave  him  a  part  in  "Perfect  Understanding,"  and  so  the  situation  was  re-  versed.    Michael  couldn't  find  time  away  from  the  studio    Right  now — with  the  experiences  of  childbirth  and  producing  a  picture  in  London  behind  her — she  believes  it  will  come  through  a  quiet  farm  on  the  Riviera  where  she  and  Michael  and  the  three  children  can  live  close  to  the  peace  of  nature,  and  forget  the  turbulence  of  life  entirely.  "Retirement"  spells  "peace"  to  her  imagination,  just  as  every  other  change  has,  heretofore,  offered  it — in  imagination.   NATURALLY,  it  won't  happen.  In  the  first  place,  she  can't  retire  to  a  farm  because  her  husband  does  not  want  it.  He  wishes  to  return  to  Hollywood  and  study  the  making  of  pic-  tures. He  has  tasted  the  excitement  which  always  accompanies  picture-making  and  likes  it.  He  would  never  consent  to  farm  life,  not  even  the  colorful  one  of  the  Riviera.  So  to  secure  her  present  desire,  Gloria  would,  I  firmly  believe,  be  obliged  to  go  her  own  way,  and  Michael  his.   But  deeper  far  than  that,  Gloria  Swanson  is  one  of  the  women  of  our  generation  who  will  live  drama  until  death — as  Cleopatra  was  in  her  age.  Gloria  can  no  more  remain  in  peace-  ful retirement  than  a  skylark  could  be  content  in  a  closet.  She  belongs  to  the  world  of  zestful  action,  high  emotion,  romance  and  tempest.   Nothing  could  be  more  typically  Gloria,  from  beginning  to  end,  than  "Perfect  Understanding."   It  was  not  alone  Gloria's  decision  to  make  a  picture  in  Lon-  don. Everyone  had  advised  it.  They  told  her  how  cheaply,  how  easily,  she  could  do  it.  They  advised  her  this  way  and  that.   Gloria  listened.     Somehow,  Gloria  always  listens.    As  often  as  she  has  been  ill-advised,  still  she  listens.    It  is  another  pecu-  liarity of  her  type  of  woman.  h      p!  j  &  f\r  The  other  afternoon,  while  she  was  curled   II     D  IV  I  y         jnt0  a  tjny        [■  PLEASE  TURN  TO  page  110  ]    35    Is  It  Goodbye  to  Each  Other  as  a  Studio  Team?    UNITED  they  stand,  separated  they  shall  fall !   Hollywood  is  whispering  this  pre-  diction about  Josef  Von  Sternberg  and  Marlene  Dietrich.   Can  it  be  true  that  two  vivid  personalities  set  up  an  entity  for  each  other — that  one  be-  comes a  necessary  complement  to  the  other?   Before  Von  sailed  away  for  his  "holiday"  in  Europe,  he  told  our  reporter  that  he  was  through  with  pictures — "sick  and  tired  of  the  silly  stories  which  had  been  thrust  upon  him.  "  He  went  on  to  explain,  however,  that  this  did  not  mean  he  was  through  with  studios  or  his  own  ideas  about  pictures.  Von  Sternberg  claims  his  mind  was  trained  along  philosophic  lines  and  that  fiction  is  no  material  out  of  which  to  make  movies.  He  is  going  to  see  the  world,  absorb  the  feel-   36    ing  of  the  Orient,  live  in  far-off  places  where  he  can  shake  the  studio  cobwebs  from  his  mind  and  come  back — sometime  perhaps — with  ideas  which  he  shall  develop.  He  makes  no  plans,  living  entirely  on  inspirations.   Marlene  is  his  pet  prodigy.  Wasn't  it  Von  who  found  her  as  a  struggling  nobody  in  Ger-  many and  with  his  genius  eye  perceived  her  possibilities?   Marlene  says  she  realizes  that  without  Von  Sternberg's  guidance  she  would  no  doubt  have  remained  just  where  she  was,  in  a  drab  little  theater,  trying  vainly  for  a  place  in  the  sun.   When  she  left  America  some  time  ago,  she,  too,  said  she  was  through.  But  she  wasn't,  actually.  She  returned  and  when  the  legal  battle  with  Paramount  over  breaking  her  con-  tract was  finally  adjusted,  Marlene  went  back    to  Hollywood,  like  a  dutiful  little  girl,  to  com-  plete "Song  of  Songs"  under  Rouben  Mam-  oulian's  direction.   Will  Marlene  be  content  to  remain  in  Holly-  wood under  a  strange  director's  tutelage?  And  if  she  does,  will  any  director,  except  Von  Stern-  berg, be  able  to  bring  out  her  ethereal  loveli-  ness as  this  one  man  has  been  able  to  do  it?   When  Marlene  came  to  Hollywood  she  had  already  made  "The  Blue  Angel,"  in  Germany,  under  Von  Sternberg's  direction,  and  it  was  his  camera  eye  which,  little  by  little,  developed  the  soulful  qualities  which  stamp  La  Dietrich  the  orchidaceous  lady  of  filmdom.   And  Marlene  is  grateful.  Vet,  on  the  other  hand,  Von  Sternberg's  genius  may  never  have  impressed  us  if  he  had  not  found  such  promis-  ing material  as  Dietrich  with  which  to  work.    Fandom  shed  tears  over  its  Gaynor-Farrell  dream,  when  Virginia  Valli  appeared  as  Charlie's  bride    Charlie  and  Janet  sometimes  danced  together.  Lydell  and  Janet,  Charlie  and  Virginia  were  all  friends    Now  What  Next  Janet:    HOLLYWOOD  was  stunned  by  the  news  of  Janet  Gaynor's  separa-  tion from  Lydell  Peck.   But  this  is  not  the  first  shock.  Janet  has  given  Hollywood.  She  did  it  three  years  ago  when  she  married  Peck  at  a  time  when  Hollywood  expected  she  would  marry  Charles  Farrell.   And  now  that  Hollywood  is  again  able  to  sit  up  and  take  nourishment,  it  wonders  what  connection  —  if  any — lies  be-  tween Farrell's  recent  departure  from  Fox  studios  and  Janet's  de-  cision to  leave  Peck.   In  a  manner  of  speaking  Janet  Gaynor  may  be  said  to  be  a  woman  with  two  men  in  her  life  —  one  her  screen  "sweetheart,"  Farrell;  the  other  her  real  life  husband,  Peck.   The  former,  her  companion  in  studio  work;  the  latter  her  home  man.   The  Gaynor-Farrell  screen  romance  that  the  public  has  de-  lighted in  has  been  Hollywood's  most  enduring  speculation.  It  began  in  1926,  when  the  two  worked  together  in  "7th  Heaven."  Before  completion  of  that  picture,  Hollywood  decided  they  were  in  love.  They  seemed  so  ideally  suited,  so  Hollywood  said,  with  their  clean,  untar-  nished, youthful  desires  and  their  ambitions.  They  were  two  dreamers,  and  thev  seemed  as    What  will  follow  her  separa-  tion from  Lydell  Peck?  Even  Hollywood  will  not  prophesy   By  James  F  idler    And  here's  Lydell  Peck,  who  many  say  re-  sembles Charlie.  Do  you  see  it  or  don't  you?    complementary  to  each  other  as  two  love  birds;  as  dew  to  dawn.   Throughout  the  years  that  fol-  lowed "7th  Heaven,"  Hollywood  saw  the  two  constantly  together,  and  Hollywood  wondered  when  they  would  marry.  But  Holly-  wood did  not  know  that  which  I  knew:  That  both  Janet  and  Charlie  feared  the  effect  of  mar-  riage on  their  screen  future.   Janet  said  to  me  one  day:  "I  am  afraid  to  marry.  I  have  been  told  it  might  ruin  my  career."   Then — if  not  now — Janet  re-  garded her  career  before  all  else.   But  as  sweethearts  they  were  as  constant  as  heart  beats.  No  premiere  was  complete  without  them.  They  worshipped  each  other  to  the  music  of  Cocoanut  Grove  orchestras.  Summer  months  found  them  romping  and  adoring  together  at  Malibu.  The  sight  of  one  without  the  other  was  rarer  than  wingless  angels.   If  Charlie  was  seen  alone,  the  first  question  asked  of  him  was:  "Where  is  Janet?"   If  she  was  encountered  alone,  the  question  became,  "Where  is  Charlie?"   Enter  Lydell  Peck,  a  handsome  young  San  Francisco  attorney.   When  Peck,  with  dogged  per-  sistence, claimed  more  and  more  of  Janet's  attentions,  Hollywood  was  agog.

Seeley  Studio    From  the  little  baby  with  angel  curls  to  one  of  the  most  acclaimed  stars  in  all  filmland —  what  a  vista  of  memories  stretches  before  Ann  Harding's  sister,  as  she  takes  pen  in  hand  to  tell  the  story!  To  the  right  we  see  baby  Ann — Dorothy  Gatley  in  those  days —  as  she  appeared  when  strangers  stopped  her  on  the  street  to  finger  that  enchanting  hair;  while  above  is  the  author,  smiling  serenely  as  she    fondly    recollects    those    far-off    times    Ai    NN  HARDING  Signs  New  Contract— Becomes  One  Of  Highest  Salaried  Stars  In  Industry."  To  me,  older  sister  of  the  girl  christened  Dorothy  Gatley,  "the  words  held  no  great  surprise.  But  the  sight  of  that  banner  on  the  newspaper  did  bring  a  rush  of  pictures  to  my  mind,  a  kaleidoscopic  review  of  our  life  together — memories  of  a  happy  childhood — glimpses —   A  young  mother  is  walking  along  the  Alamo  Plaza,  in  San  Antonio,  Texas,  holding  the  little  hand  of  a  pink  and  white  cherub.  They  stroll  past  a  photographic  studio  and  the  mother  is  somewhat  astonished  when  the  photographer  himself  rushes  out,  gazing  at  the  cherub.   "Please,  madame, "  he  begs,  never  taking  his  eyes  off  the  solemn  little  countenance,  "will  you  not  permit  me  to  photo-  graph your  child?  I  will  gladly  give  you  any  number  of  poses  for  the  privilege  of  placing  one  portrait  in  my  window.  Oh —  so  lovely  the  baby!"   "Thank  you,"  replies  madame,  rather  frigidly,  "but  of  course,  I  could  never  dream  of  allowing  my  child's  face  to  be  displayed  to  the  public!  "   WHITE  curls,  with  a  very  pink  scalp  for  background;  dark  blue  eyes  that  looked  straight  through  you  at  the  age  of  one;  a  grand  disposition  even  in  the  infant  stage,  with  occasional  outburst  of  rage  at  some  imagined  grievance,  resulting  inva-  riably in  pulling  out  diminutive  handfuls  of  the  white  curls  .  .  .  Transplanted  to  Ft.  Sheridan,  on  Lake  Michigan;  first  glimpse  of  frosty  weather,  and  an  excited  little  three-year-old  bundled  up  in  a  dark  blue  chinchilla  coat  and  leggings,  struggling  heroi-  cally with  a  snow-ball  twice  as  big  as  herself,  destined  to  become  the  tummy  of  a  snow  man.    When  Dorothy  made  her  first  excursions  into  the  world  be-  yond the  front  gate,  to  her  dismay,  she  found  that  she  could  not  set  foot  upon  the  street  without  being  stopped  by  someone  who  simply  couldn't  pass  by  without  remarking  upon  the  white  curls.   Mother  would  see  the  admiring  gleam  in  approaching  eyes?1  and  quicken  her  steps,  but  to  no  avail.    Their  path  would  be  blocked,  hands  would  reach  out  to  touch  the  shining  hair  and  J  there  was  no  stopping  the  question  that  became  so  hateful — -ll   "  Where  did  you  get  those  beautiful  curls?    May  I  have  one?'j   Mother  had  coached  her  in  polite  rejoinder,  but  tears  off]  exasperation  refused  to  be  winked  back  and  the  corners  of  the  |  little  rosebud  mouth  would  square  off  as  she  replied,   "God  gave  'em  to  me" — sniff — "but  I'd  love  to  give  'em  toj  you  if  I  could!"   AND  how  she  meant  the  last  part  of  that  speech!  The  fun  of  occasional  shopping  trips  to  Chicago  was  com  pletely  spoiled  by  still  more  people  who  would  stop  the  chili  and  reiterate  the  question.  One  such  trip  just  escaped  tragedy.  Mother  and  Dody  had  had  a  particularly  trying  session  with  the  admiring  multitude  in  Marshall  Field's  and  mother  was  waiting  for  change  on  the  last  purchase.  She  relinquished  her  grasp  of  the  moist  little  hand  at  her  side  to  accept  the  change —  and  when  she  turned  and  looked  down  with  the  cheerful  news  that  they  were  going  home  now,  there  was  no  baby.   Frantically,  mother  turned  to  the  salesgirl— "  My  baby's — 1  gone!"  The  woman  signaled  to  a  detective  who  sent  out  a  general  alarm,  while  mother  made  a  superhuman  effort  to  get  hold  of  herself  and  fight  off  ugly  visions  of  kidnaping.  After,  what  amounted  actually  to  only  two  or  three  minutes,  a  small,  starched  figure  appeared  at  the  door,  one  hand  pulling  a  white    }   «l  to    pique  hat  down  to  hide  the  curls,  the  other  swallowed  up  in  the  firm  clasp  of  a  strange  man  in  a  derby  hat.   He  was  a  store  detective  who  had  been  standing  at  the  en-  trance to  the  store  and  before  the  alarm  was  sent  out  had  no-  ticed a  child  following  a  woman  who  apparently  paid  no  atten-  tion to  her.  The  woman  seemed  so  poorly  dressed  in  compar-  ison with  Dorothy  that  it  had  aroused  the  man's  suspicion  and  he  trailed  them.   THE  following  year  found  us  back  in  San  Antonio,  Texas,  again.  Dorothy  was  just  old  enough  now  to  climb  a  tree,  and  whenever  I  think  of  her  as  a  child,  the  first  picture  that  comes  to  me  is  that  of  a  little  figure  swaying  in  the  top  of  a  tree,    The  latest  tribute  to  Ann  Harding's  supreme  art — for  the  opening  of  the  dazzling  new  Roxy  Theater  in  New  York's  famed  "Radio  City,"  the  choice  was  Ann  Harding  and  Leslie  Howard  (above)  in  "The  Animal  King-  dom." To  the  left  is  Ann's  name  blazing  forth  to   New  York  throngs    utterly  content  with  her  own  quiet  com-  pany.   Then  off  to  join  father  in  Cuba,  where  he  had  been  sent  as  instructor  of  field  artillery  to  the  Cuban  army.  Through  the  customs,  with  military  dispatch,  we  were  driven  out  to  the  army  post,  Camp  Columbia.  Little  black-haired,  black-  eyed,  tanned  youngsters,  lined  up  at  neighboring  fences,  jabbered  away  ex-  citedly in  rapid-fire  Spanish  entirely  un-  intelligible to  us  except  for  the  painfully  evident  fact  that  two  very  blonde  A  meri-  t  amis  were  under  critical  discussion.   NOTHER  picture  —  a  straight-  backed,  pink  and  white  little  "  Gen-  eral, ' '  white  curls  tucked  up  under  father's  military  cap,  a  wooden  sword  held  firmly  in  strict  accordance  with  army  regula-  tions, a  clear  little  voice  ripping  out  mili-  tary orders  in  fluent  Spanish  to  a  serious  dark  little  squad  of  soldiers,  each  equipped  with  a  wooden  sword  of  the  "General's "' fashioning  .  .  .  Acknowledged  leader,  having  mastered  the  vocabulary  of  childhood,  she  had  soon  reached  the  point  where  she  spoke  their  language  better  than  they,  with  ten  times  the  force,  and  full  accompaniment  of  Latin  gesture.  Being  stationed  at  the  same  post  for  two  years  was  quite  a  novelty,  so  we  were  not  surprised  to  hear  of  orders  to  return  to  the  States.  Our  education  had  become  a  serious  problem  by  this  time,  so  it  was  decided  that  mother  should  take  us  to  New  York,  where  her  mother  lived,  and  make  an  attempt  at  'staying  put"  until  we  had  finished  school.  We  stayed  there  just  one  year,  moving  to  Montclair,  New  Jersey,  shortly  before  the  outbreak  of  the  World  War.   U    Ann's  First  Triumphs — in  School    How  would  you  like  to  see  Ann  Harding  as  she  appears  at  the  right?  This  fearsome  shot  was  taken  when,  in  her  'teens,  she  played  MacDuff  in  her  board-  ing school's  presentation  of  "Macbeth,"  on  two  days'  notice.  And  note  how,  when  stepping  off  to  school  along  a  quiet  New  Jersey  street,  she  was  already  show-  ing the  poise  and  grace  which  now  add  so  much  to  her  charm  on  the  screen!    The  remaining  years  of  Dorothy's  school  life  were  more  or  less  uneventful,  with  a  few  highlights — a  year's  sojourn  at  the  Baldwin  School  in  Bryn  Mawr,  and  a  flourishing  conclusion  of  her  scholastic  career  when  she  completed  the  last  two  years  of  high  school  in  one  at  East  Orange  High,  New  Jersey.  At  the  Baldwin  School,  the  Christmas  play  was  quite  an  event — "Mac-  beth: A  Tragedy  by  William  Shakespeare.  Produced  by  Mrs.  Otis  Skinner. "  Dorothy  was  originally  cast  for  Ross,  a  minor  part  as  she  was  just  a  sophomore  and  newly  come  to  the  school.  However,  MacDuff  came  down  with  the  measles  two  days  be-  fore the  performance  and  Dorothy's  extraordinary  ability  to  memorize  won  her  the  role.   MOTHER  and  I  arrived  at  the  school  shortly  before  the  cur-  tain was  to  go  up.  Our  first  sight  of  daughter  and  sister  was  rather  terrifying:  heavy  makeup,  ferocious  eyebrows  and  mustache,  armor  breastplate,  enormous  boots  and  clanking  sword — and  in  one  mailed  fist,  a  tube  of  white  vaseline  which  she  was  swallowing  as  fast  as  possible.   "Lost  my  voice,"  she  croaked  in  a  hoarse  whisper,  "trying  to  talk  like  a  man.  But  I  think  I'll  get  it  back  in  an  hour  if  I  can  only  swallow  this  stuff.  Mustn't  talk  any  more  now — "  and  down  went  another  gulp  of  vaseline.  Sure  enough,  the  well-oiled  vocal  chords  responded  to  the  heroic  treatment  and  she  got  through  the  evening  nobly.   Dorothy  left  Baldwin  with  regret,  but  as  it  was  financially  impossible  to  continue  there,  that  was  that,  and  she  entered  East  Orange  High.    Her  memorizing  faculty  made  quick  work   k2    of  studying.  She  always  finished  the  next  day's  homework  during  school  hours,  not  with  the  idea  of  impressing  her  teachers  but  sim-  ply because  it  gave  her  free  time  to  go  to  the  movies  and  practice  her  piano  in  the  afternoons.  Never-  theless, she  got  the  reputation  in  school  of  being  something  of  a  bookworm — highly  proper  and  ad-  mirable, but  not  so  much  fun  on  a  party — "highbrow,"  in  otha*  words.   SO  it  was,  that  when  she  an-  nounced her  intention  of  going  out  for  the  lead  in  the  senior  play,  its  author,  Garrett  Fort  (now  a  well-known  scenario  writer  and  playwright)  begged  her  not  to  do  it.  The  part  was  that  of  a  very  lan-  guorous vamp  who  turned  out  to  be  a  secret  service  agent  in  the  last  three  minutes.   "You  know  the  faculty  will  give  it  to  you,"  exploded  Garrett.  "  You're  teacher's  pet  around  here  — but,  doggone  it—  you'll  ruin  my  play.  This  is  a  vamp  part—  do  you  realize  that?  Lord  knows  you  haven't  any  'jazz'  in  your  elbows  — it'll  be  a  complete  flop."   To  his  dismay,  she  carried  out  her  intention  and  walked  off  with  the  part  tucked  under  the  jazz-  less  elbows.  She  proceeded  to  re-  hearse it  in  a  very  proper  manner,  dear  to  the  traditions  of  the  fac-  ulty, but  nothing  less  than  heart-  breaking to  Garrett.  The  night  of  the  show  found  him  slumped  into  a  far  corner  of  the  auditorium.  His  heart  sank  as  the  curtains  were  drawn,  disclosing — he  sat  up  with  a  jerk — -what  was  this?   In  a  purple  chiffon  gown  and  the  one  and  only  marcel  wave  she  was  ever  known  to  inflict  upon  her  hair,  Dody,  who  had  been  a  devotee  of  the  movies  since  grammar  school  days,  gave  an  imi-  tation of  the  current  super-siren  of  the  screen  that  brought  the  audience  right  out  of  their  seats.   To  Garrett's  bewildered  delight  and  the  petrified  horror  of  the  faculty,  she  glided  through  the  part  with  sinuous  undula-  tion of  hip,  sophisticated  shrugging  of  shoulder,  half-closed,  heavy-lidded  eyes,  and  parted  lips.  The  audience,  unaccus-  tomed as  it  was  to  anything  like  this  coming  from  the  senior  class,  stamped  and  cheered  and  howled  its  enjoyment  of  the  play  and  the  performance.  The  leading  lady  and  the  author  were  heroes  of  the  hour.   School  days  were  over  for  both  of  us.  Father  had  returned  from  a  year  spent  overseas  with  the  Rainbow  Division  and  the  Army  of  Occupation.  A  Kentucky  village  had  been  comman-  deered as  part  of  a  field  artillery  training  area — a  desolate  little  town  thirty  miles  out  of  Louisville.  He  was  sent  there  to  turn  it  into  a  permanent  post  and  it  was  time  for  the  family  to  fore-  gather once  more.   AT  first  it  was  fun — Dody  was  made  daughter  of  the  regi-  ment, a  great  ball  was  given  in  her  honor,  various  officers'  wives  entertained  for  her ;  but  by  the  time  I  joined  them  a  seething  restlessness  had  taken  hold  of  her.  Riding  horseback  was  our  one  great  solace,  paper  chases  cross-country  the  one  "social  event"  to  which  we  could  look  forward  with  enjoyment.   Day  after  day  for  many  months  we  would  order  our  horses  for  eight-thirty  and  explore  the  surrounding  country  for  miles  on  every  side.

You  said  I  was  to  go  see  him  and  find  out  why — find  out  what's  the  secret  of  his  pe-  culiar charm.   He's  no  lily  for  looks,  and  he's  certainly  not  romantic  if  you  compare  him  with  Leslie  Howard  or  Clark  Gable  (or  even  with  a  cigar-store  Injun)  but  he  docs  get  baskets  and  baskets  of  love-letters  from  women.   But,  if  you  want  to  know  anything  about  those  letters,  you  try  interviewing  him.  Just  try!  In  the  first  place,  Roland  is  very  shy  and  retiring.  In  the  second,  he's  a  gentleman,  and  no  gentleman,  the  way  he  looks  at  it,  talks  about  his  love  let-  ters, even  when  they  come  by  the  basket.   If  you  think  it's  easy,  you  just  try  to  pry  something  out  of  that  guy!  Opening  oysters  with  your  fingers  is  a  juvenile  pas-  time compared  with  pulling  Young  out  of  his  shell.   Here's  what  happened  when  I  tried  to  interview  him.  I'm  telling  it  to  you  word  for  word,  just  as  it  happened.   Hopelessly  yours,  Jack  Jamison.   The  scene  is  Roland's  den,  in  his  big  house  on  Linden  Drive  in  Beverly  Hills.  It  is  a  small,  snug  room,  with  French  windows  looking  out  on  the  garden.  The  walls  are  crowded  with  etchings,  wood-blocks,  and  book-cases.  A  shelf  bears  hundreds  of  figurines  of  penguins.  It  is  a  cluttered,  cosy,  masculine  room,  except  for  the  flowers  in  a  penguin  motif  holder.  A  fire  crackles  cheerfully  in  the  fireplace.

Roland  Young:  So  I  see.  I  fall  down  myself.  You  ought  to  have  seen  the  famous  Roland  Young  Fall  of  the  Spring  of  '83.  It  was  at  a  benefit  tea  for  the  wives  of  radio  tenors  who  had  been  killed  by  angry  mobs.  I  came  down  some  steps  to  a  polished  floor,  and  along  the  floor,  in  a  row,  there  were  a  lot  of  little  rugs,  a  big  bearskin  rug,  and  the  hostess  sitting  at  a  tea  wagon.  I  tripped  over  the  bearskin  rug,  skidded  on  the  little  ones,  and  ended  up  on  top  of  the  tea  wagon  with  my  head  in  the  hostess'  lap.  That's  a  graceful  way  to  enter  a  drawing-room!   Jamison:  Well,  I  guess  you'd  like  to  know  why  I'm  here.  Mr.  Young,  Photoplay  has  decided  that  you  have  sex-appeal!

(Reading) :  Do  you  know  what  sex-appeal  is?   Roland  Young:    Whose?   Jamison:  Yours,  of  course.  You've  heard  of  sex-appeal,  haven't  you?  You  know  what  it  is,  roughly?

"Ha,  ha,  the  joke's  on  you,  baby,"  exclaimed  the  dear  little  tots,  "we  don't  know  any  prayers!"   TT  was  the  custom  of  Aline  MacMahon  to  make  one  Warner  Brothers  flicker  and  then  hop   right  off  to   New  York   to   visit  friend  husband,  a  New  York  architect.   So,  when  Warners  talked  Aline  into  signing  on  the  dotted  line,  Aline  stipulated  in  her  con-  tract, that  she  be  permitted  to  make  four  trips  to  New  York  every  year.

He  proved  to  be  an  expert  at  the  job.  In  fact,  he  was  so  expert  that  when  Director  Lowell  Sherman  glanced  toward  his  wrist  watch  that  evening,  there  was  no  watch  to  glance  at.

A  ND  their  intimates  say  Harpo  Marx  at  last  has  got  serious  about  something.  He   and   Susan   Fleming  are  going   to   be  married    soon.   [  PLEASE  TURN  TO  PAGE  88  ]    51    A    <!<?    CHINAMAN  and  a   white  woman  married  to  each  other  won't  get  along  so  well,''  sez  Sergeant  Quirt  Eddie  Lowe,  "and  how  could  they?  They  have  en-  tirely different  viewpoints.  Men-  tally they  live  in  completely  differ-  ent worlds — their  ideas  and  ideals  are  totally  different  from  one  another.  How  can  such  a  disparity  result  in  happiness?  It  takes  an  Oriental  to  understand  an  Oriental  — and  an  actress  to  understand  an  actor."   Wife  Lilyan  Tashman  is  essenti-  ally an  actress,  just  as  Eddie  is  essentially  an  actor.   They  are  happy  largely  because  .life  for  them  is  really  a  stage  which  they  share  together.  If  Lilyan  were  not  an  actress,  Eddie  believes,  she  wouldn't  be  able  to  carry  her  part.  She  wouldn't  be  able  to  "play  up"  to  his  lines.   "I  think  both  husband  and  wife  should  have  careers  of  their  own,"  he  said,  "and  that  in  the  case  of  picture  people,  at  least,  it  should  be  the  same  kind  of  career.  In  the  majority  of  cases  only  a  medically  trained  woman  makes  an  ideal  wife  for  a  doctor,  and  the  underlying  psychology  is  the  same.   "Wives  who  haven't  had  medical  training  are  almost  invariably  jeal-  ous of  a  doctor's  women  patients —  and  a  wife  who  hasn't  herself  been  on  the  screen  is  nearly  always  just  as  jealous  of  her  husband's  love  scenes.   "That's  human  nature,  and  nothing  we  can  do  or  say  is  going  to  change  it.  And  jealousy  is  an  al-  most insurmountable  obstacle  to  happiness  in  any  marriage."    BUT   for   Eddie    the    thing    goes  deeper  than  that.   Quite  aside  from  the  motion  pic-  ture world  and  his  own  actress- wife,  Eddie  believes  that  every  wife  should  have  something  to  do.  He  believes  so  most  emphatically,  and  to  the  extent  that  he  explains  a  lot  of  things  which  happen  to  marriage  in  America  with  the  statement  that  most  American  wives  have  too  little  to  interest  them  and  therefore  too  much  idle  time  on  their  hands.   "  Perhaps  the  one  thing  which  leads  to  most  misunderstandings  and  marital  unhappiness  in  the  modern  American  home,"  Eddie  as-  serted, "is  simply  that  the  wife  has  no  adequate  outlet  for  her  energy.  Women  of  this  type  live  mostly  in  apartments  or  hotels  and  haven't  a  thing  in  the  world  to  occupy  them  — so,  when  a  husband  comes  home,  dog-tired  after  a  hard  day's  work,  she  wants  to  step  out.  He  doesn't  feel  like  it.  Naturally  there  is  resentment  on  both  sides,  which  leads  perhaps  to  a  quarrel.  And  that's  what  leads  to  much  of  the  trouble  so  many  couples  seem  to  be  having  nowa-  days."   As  far  as  Eddie  and  Lilyan  are  concerned,  each  understands  that  after  a  day  on  the  set  the  other  is  tired.  So  they  don't  try  to  drag  each  other  out.   They  attend  to  their  social  life  between  pictures,  when  both  are  free.   "And  how  is  it,"  Eddie  asked,  "that  so  many  women  who  at   52    I'll  Take  An   A    ctress    ^Lilyan  and  I  never  bore  each  other,"  says  Eddie  Lowe   As   told  to  Reginald  Taviner    "Imagine  the  compliment  paid  a  man,"  says  Eddie,  "when  his  wife  lives  with  him  because  of  love — not  because  she's  got  to  stay  to  be  sure  of  a  living"    most  have  only  to  run  a  home — and  as  often  as  not  they  escape  even  this  responsibility  by  being  hotel  or  apartment  dwellers —  are  so  busy  with  bridge,  cocktail  parties,  pink  teas  and  so  forth  that  when  their  husbands  come  home  the  best  they  can  do  by  way  of  dinner  is  a  can  of  sardines  and  some  cole  slaw  from  the  delicatessen?  Lilyan  works  hard  making  pictures,  but  still  she  has  time  to  run  our  house,  pick  out  and  buy  her  own  clothes,  attend  to  the  million  and  one  things  that  every  prominent  picture  player  has  to  attend  to — and  still  not  neglect  me!

No  house  is  large  enough  for  two  audiences,"  says  Frank  Morgan   As    told    to    Ruth   Rankin    tired  and  wanted  a  little  service?  She  would  be  all  worn  out  with  looking  beautiful  and  playing  hot  love  scenes,  and  my  pitiful  laments,  my  stories  about  what  the  director  said  to  so-and-so  and  how  hoosis  went  up  in  his  lines,  wouldn't  mean  a  darn  thing  to  her.  She  would  have  a  lot  of  her  own  to  tell.  And  you  can't  have  two  audiences  in  the  same  house!  I  guess  maybe  I  have  head-man  trouble.  Anyway,  I  want  to  be  head-man  at  home."   Frank  shifted  his  left  eyebrow  into  third.  (You'll  notice  the  gesture  in  "Hallelujah,  I'm  a  Bum,"  the  Jolson  picture,  in  which  he  plays  the  Mayor  of  New  York.)   Just  then  Alma  breezed  in,  fresh  and  rosy  from  the  sharp,  late  after-  noon air.  She  greeted  her  husband  as  if  she  hadn't  seen  him  since  two  weeks  ago  Friday,  and  had  a  crush  on  him.    Di    "To  make  a  successful  marriage,  a  woman  must  lead  her  man's  life !    I  want  to  be  head  man  at  home,"  says  Frank.     Well,  Frank,  it  looks  as  if  you  are!    "'VE  been  married  nineteen  years  to  a  non-professional,"   said  Frank  Morgan.     "We're  getting  better  and  better   acquainted  all  the  time,  and  I  have  an  idea  it's  going  to   "work  out  all  right.     But  do  you  think  for  one  minute  I   could  have  been  happy  that  long  with  an  actress?''   "Why  couldn't  you  be  happy  with  an  actress?"  I  retorted.  "Why  not,  indeed!"  Frank  retorted.    "Because  some  man,  probably  the  one  playing  opposite  her,  would  have  been  run-  ning around  waiting  on  her  all  day,  so  she  wouldn't  trip  over  her  eyelashes.    And  what  would  that  make  me,  if  I  came  home    T    ON'T  you  think  an  actress's   husband  can  be  head-man?  "  I   made   bold    to   inquire,    when    we   had  settled  down  again  after  Alma's   refreshing  entrance.   "Oh,  I  suppose  he  can  be —  there's  no  law  against  it.  But  from  where  I've  been  sitting  all  my  stage  life,  he  almost  never  gets  to  be,  whether  he's  an  actor  or  not.  Look  at  the  husbands  of  Elsie  Ferguson  and  Jeanne  Eagels,  for  instance.  Fine  business  men,  crazy  about  their  wives.  But  they  couldn't  make  it  successful.  Men  are  not  as  adaptable  as  women."   "How  much  adapting  should  a  woman  do?"  Alma  asked  him,  with  a  sly  twinkle  at  me.   "  To  make  a  successful  marriage,"  Frank  informed  us,  "a  woman  must  lead  her  man's  life.  And  a  man  who  leads  his  woman's  life,  as  he  is  forced  to  do  to  a  large  extent  if  the  wife  is  an  actress — well,  he  sacri-  fices something  very  definite  that  makes  him  a  man.  If  he  holds  out  and  doesn't  sacrifice,  then  the  mar-  riage doesn't  hold  out."   "But  listen,  Frank.  Isn't  it  rather  selfish  to  expect  a  woman  to  lead  her  man's  life  altogether?"  I  asked  sweetly,  inviting  fireworks.  And  getting  them.   "Selfish!"  he  exploded.     "Then  she  shouldn't  get  married!     Either  she  loves  him  enough  to  know  that  he  is  making  the  direct  life  for  both  of  them,  with  her  indirect  assist-  ance, or  she  doesn't.    She  must  be  satisfied  to  be  the  power  behind  the  throne,  she  must  be  free  to  go  where  he  goes.     Marriages  of  actors  and  actresses  have  to  suffer  innumerable  separations.     Separations  are  dan-  gerous.    Absence  makes  the  heart  grow  fonder— of  somebody  else."  "And,  of  course,"  Alma  remarked,  "all  actors  are  just  a  little  bit  crazy.     It  helps  if  their  wives  are,  too,  actresses  or  not.  That  is,  if  they  are  careful  to  be  crazy  at  the  same  time."  Frank  tossed  his  right  eyebrow  into  the  ring.  "Being  Alma,  she  works  up  her  enthusiasm  right  along  with  mine,  and  if  we  have  found  an  old  place  which  I  enjoy  planning  to  remodel — my  favorite  vice,  by  the  way — she  says,  'We'll  put  the  fireplace  over  here,  and  don't  you  think  this  would  be  a  lovely  spot  for  a  high  window?'

But  first  of  all  I've  got  to  tell  you  about  the  girl  herself.   The  story  goes  that  Sam  Goldwyn  saw  her  on  the  stage  in  New  York  and  signed  her  because  she  looked  so  much  like  his   54    The  girl  who  once  was  told  her  shoulders  were  too  large  for  her  ever  to  become  a  screen  actress.  But  Sylvia  evolved  the  charming  Constance  Cummings  whom  you  see  here.  Whether  or  not  you  are  Miss  Cummings'  type,  there  is  much  valuable  information  here    for    you,    too.       (Inset    Sylvia)    pretty  wife.    But  Goldwyn's  too  smart  a  man  for  that.    He  gave  the  kid  a  con-  tract because  she  had  talent.     With  a  lot  of  fancy  hullabaloo  they  brought  her  to  Hollywood  to  play  opposite  Ronald  Colman  in  a  picture.    They  made  some  screen  tests  of  her  and  then  one  night  after  midnight  they  called  me  on  the  telephone  and  asked  if  I  would  take  her  as  a  patient.  Her  legs,  it  seems,  were  too  big  and  her  shoulders  too  broad.  They  gave  me  quite  a  fine  line  about  how  grand  it  would  be  for  me  to  treat  this  new  star,  but  after  you've  pounded  the  day-  lights out  of  sixteen  women  a  day,  one  piece  of  flesh  looks  about  like  another,  so  I  wasn't  very  impressed.     But  because  they  were  so  insistent  I  said  I  would  take  her  the  next  day  at  my  lunch  hour.   An  assistant  director  brought  her  over  and  left  her.    Connie  was  a  happy,  freckled-faced,  muscular,  athletic  girl.

Sylvia    right  away,  but  I  knew  what  the  trouble  was.  Ronald  Colman  isn't  a  giant  and  I  felt  sure  that  Connie's  broad  shoulders  wouldn't  look  well  in  closeups  with  Ronnie.  I  can  take  off  flesh— as  any  of  you  who  have  followed  my  advice  know — but  I  can't  whittle  down  bone.   Then  I  took  a  look  at  her  legs—  typical  dancer's  legs,  with  big  muscles  on  the  calf.  "Oh,  baby,"  I  said  to  her,  "this  is  going  to  hurt."    She  smiled.    "I  don't  care,"  she  said,  "pound  away."   And  I  did,  but  no  matter  what  I  did,  Connie  grinned.  And  that — all  you  girls  who  want  to  be  as  lovely  as  she — that's  the  spirit.  She  had  nice  ankles  so  I  began  to  work  on  the  calves.  Here's  what  I  did,  and  you  can  do  the  same,  like  this.  Dig  under  those  muscles  on  your  legs  with  your  fingers  and  dig  in  until  it  hurts.  Then  squeeze  the  muscles  with  your  hands  as  hard  as  you  can.  Do  this  for  half  an  hour  a  day.  Yes,  that's  what  I  said!  Then  with  a  Turkish  towel  spread  over  the  muscles  pound  with  the  flat  of  your  hand  until  you  make  your-  self yell.   IF,  as  Connie  had,  you  have  muscular  upper  arms  and  muscles  on  the  shoulders  do  the  same  thing,  working  the  left  arm  with  your  right  hand — and  vice  versa.  I  treated  her  this  way  for  an  hour  every  day  and  in  two  weeks  I  had  brought  those  muscles  down.  If  you  will  work  on  yourself  for  one  hour  every  day  for  two  weeks  you  can  do  the  same  thing.  I  know  it!    I  proved  it  with  Connie.   But,  as  I  have  told  you,  I  couldn't  whittle  off  any  bone  from  the  shoulders  and  I  knew  what  was  going  to  happen  to  the  poor  kid.   It  was  interesting— and  a  little  sad-  to  watch  her  expression  day  by  day.  Every  day  I'd  ask  her,  "Well,  how  are  you  getting  along  at  the  studio?"   And  here  are  the  sort  of  replies  I'd  get:   "  They  are  awfully  nice  to  me,  but  they  are  having  difficulty  in  finding  just  the  right  costumes,"  and  "They  are  really  sweet  at  the  studio,  but  they  say  I'm  quite  an  athletic  type."   How  well  I  knew  what  was  coming!  You  can  look  lovely  and  healthy  in  private  life  and  still  not  photograph  well.   Now  remember  that  Connie  wasn't  fat,  it  was  just  the  muscles  that  needed  working  on,  because  she  had  engaged  much  in  athletic  sports.  The  only  place  that  she  was  slightly  fat  was  in  the  bust.    So  here's  what  I  told     [  please  turn  to  page  92  ]    Sylvia  was  able  to  reduce  the  flesh  but  not  the  large  bone  frame  of  Constance.  But  thentheie  was  the  mat-  ter of  dress.  Constance  found  she  could  conceal  the  breadth  of  shoulders  by  clever  selection  of  gowns.  Above  is  an  example.  Remember,  without  Sylvia's  aid  Constance  might  never  have  been  a  screen  success   55    WALLY  Knows  His   Pachyderms    Wo  men  and  elephants  never  forget,  they  say,  but  neither  does  Mahout  Beery   By  Ruth  Biery    When  Wally  wasn't  feed-  ing the  elephants  or  water-  ing them,  he  took  a  hand  at  manicuring  their  hides    WHEN  Wally  Beery  started  playing  water-boy  to  a  herd  of  circus  elephants  at  the  age  of  sixteen,  he  had  no  way  of  knowing  that  about  thirty  years  later  he'd  be  cast  as  a  wrestler — the  pachyderm  of  athletes — in  a  talking  picture.  He  wouldn't,  in  fact,  have  known  what  a  talking  picture  was.  Nor  a  pachyderm,  either,  for  that  matter.   But  he  soon  found  out  that  a  thick  sk*in  sometimes  hides  a  sensitive  soul.  The  feelings  of  an  elephant,  he  learned,  are  easily  ruffled.  And  Wally's  interpretation  of  Polikai,  the  wrestler,  in  "Flesh"  shows,  for  all  his  thick  hide  and  hard  skull,  frequent  glimpses  of  a  super-sensitive  soul.   Wally  knows  all  about  elephants.  And  while  he  doesn't  claim  that  his  two  years  as  a  valet  to  the  big  fellows  qualified  him  as  a  psychologist,  he  does  believe  that  working  and  train-  ing and  living  with  them  taught  him  much  that  can  be  applied  advantageously  to  the  immensely  interesting  business  of  living  contentedly  with  human  beings.   What  did  he  learn  from  them?    Let  him  tell  it:   "You  can  do  more  with  sugar  than  with  a  lemon. "   So  instead  of  using  the  bull-hook — the  lemon — Wally  es-  tablished the  reward  system  with  sugar  and  sweet  potatoes.   "Elephants,  like  people,  appreciate  attention.  Attention  and  intelligent  consideration."   So  Wally  showered  care  and  attention  upon  his  charges  and  became  their  pet.   "Punishment,  discipline,  which  is  sometimes  necessary,  should  be  administered  with  reason  and  an  objective. "   And  mahout  Beery  chained  the  truculent  members  of  his  herd  to  a  wise  old  bull  named  "Baldy"  who  passed  on  to  them  sage  elephant  advice  punctuated  with  significant  "whams"  from  his  snout.   56    In  three  months  Wally  was  graduated  from  waterboy  to  manager  of  the  entire  herd.   Actually,  there  is  something,  some  quality,  about  Wallace  Beery  that  is  not  unlike  the  serene  disposition  of  the  lordly  elephant.  Big,  strong,  heavy,  hardly  handsome  by  any  stand-  ard, he  pursues  his  calm,  unhurried  way,  a  universal  favorite.  Kind,  generous  to  a  fault  and  peaceful,  he  is  as  sensitive  as  a  photographic  plate — or  an  elephant — but  the  trumpeting  of  an  angry  bull  does  not  far  surpass  his  hoarse  bellowing  when  he  is  aroused.   He's  a  hard  worker,  too.  That  first  three-month  period  of  bull-whacking  taught  him  the  primer  lesson  of  success:  The  fellow  who  works  harder  than  the  other  fellow  gets  to  the  top  first.  And  its  corollary:  Staying  at  the  top  means  even  harder  work,  and  more  of  it.   Wally  learned  that  long  before  he  ever  heard  of  Hollywood.  Rising  to  the  very  prominent  position  of  head  valet  to  an  elephant  herd  was  a  simple  matter  compared  to  staying  there.  But  he  stayed.  And  though  he's  been  through  in  pictures  any  number  of  times,  he  is  more  strongly  entrenched  at  the  top  of  his  profession  today  than  ever  before.   That  speaks  for  his  staying  power.  He  knows  that  one  or  two  good  pictures  may  serve  as  an  elevator  to  success,  but  that  a  couple  of  poor  ones  can  be  a  greased  slide  back  to  the  bottom.  So  Wally  Beery  plays  in  mighty  few  poor  pictures.  He  has  never  given  a  poor  performance.   He  has  to  fight  for  his  place.  He  raised  holy  hades  before  he  accepted  the  part  of  Prcysing  in  "Grand  Hotel."  But  his  characterization  of  the  overbearing  German  manufacturer  was  a  distinct  contribution  to  the  film's  selection  as  the  best  pro-  duced picture  of  the  year,  a  potent,  three-dimensional  per-  formance in  a  congregation  of     [  please  turn  to  page  106  ]    By  May   Allison   Quirk    Why  did  the  ultra-  polished  Ruth  of  yesteryear  go  hard-  boiled  on  us  in  "Frisco  Jenny"?  She  did  it  because  it  was  thought  that  good  girls  don't  stir  theater  patrons  like  the  other  kind.

Ruth  has  been  a  lady  so  long  that  she's  kicked  over  the  traces  and  decided  to  go  "baddie"   for  a  while.     She's  broken  the  Ten  Commandments  on  the  screen — and  what's  more,  she  says  she  likes  doing  it.   Ruth  Chatterton  talking!  No,  you  wouldn't  believe  it.

Nobody  is  sure  that  Ruth  Chatterton  is  doing  the  correct  thing  in  her  "right  about  face"  from  the  roles  of  suffering  ladyship  to  the  ugly  characters  she  has  gone  in  for  recently.  Those  who  have  always  loved  Chatterton  in  her  best  drawing  room  manner  have  fallen  away  from  the  box-office  now.

"Nothing  dramatic  ever  happens  to  a  good  woman.  Even  if  it  did,  her  reactions  would  not  develop  dramatic  interest.  All  good  women  are  good  in  the  same  way,  while  bad  women  characters  offer  varied  dramatic  opportunities."   DUTH  CHATTERTON  is  not  a  great  personality.  She  is  a  great  actress  and  because  of  it  she  can  run  the  gamut  of  emotions  from  the  very  proper  English  lady  at  home  in  a  London  drawing-room  to  the  boisterous,  rollicking  rowdy.

We  urge  this  in  spite  of  liberties  taken  with  history,  and  con-  siderable lack  of  epic  proportions  that  could  easily  have  been  attained;  for  these  defects  are  submerged  in  the  rich  display  of  Barrymore  art.   Ethel's  talking-screen  debut  is  exceedingly  fortunate,  for  her  subdued  fire  is  exactly  suited  to  portraying  the  regal,  but  timid  and  anxious  Imperial  mother.  And  contrary  to  certain  anticipatory  fears,  John's  dashing  Prince  Ckegodieff  and  Lionel's  sinister,  debauched  monk,  blend  with  Ethel's  performance  to  provide  a  presentation  as  unified  as  the  various  facets  of  one  gem.   Add  to  this  Ralph  Morgan's  superb  Czar,  one  of  the  best  characterizations  seen  on  the  screen  in  many  a  day;  Tad  Alexander's  profoundly  moving,  pathetic  Czarevitch;  and  Diana  Wynyard's  winsome  Princess  Natasha;  and  you  have  a  feast  of  personal  art  rarely  exceeded  in  the  picture  realm.   In  keeping  with  the  excellent  work  of  the  principals,  Director  Richard  Boleslavsky  has  provided  a  lavish  Russian  court  background,  and  in  his  use  of  news  shots  of  the  1914  Russian  mobilization  attains  the  grand  manner.

It  is  this  rare  achievement  which  makes  Fox's  version  of  Noel  Coward's  stage  success,  "  Cavalcade, "  so  outstanding.  Starting  with  a  heart-broken  upper  middle-  class  mother  (Diana  Wynyard)  sending  her  officer  husband  (Clive  Brook)  to  the  Boer  War,  it  portrays  his  safe  return  and  happy  years  rearing  their  two  boys,  until  maritime  disaster  takes  one  (John  Warburton),  and  the  World  War  snatches  the  other  (Frank  Lawton)  on  Armistice  Day.  Yet  at  the  end  the  aged  and  broken  parents  still  carry  on  with  indomitable  British  spirit.  Woven  through  this,  their  butler  (Herbert  Mundin)  and  maid  (Una  O'Connor)  live  out  the  rise,  decline  and  death  under  drink  of  a  Cockney  parent,  while  their  daughter  (Ursula  Jeans)  rises  to  fame  via  the  music  hall  stage.   A  cavalcade,  yes — a  kaleidoscope,  too — yet  through  it  all  sounds  the  mighty  tread  of  history's  march,  portrayed  in  epic  scenes  that  still  blend  beautifully  with  the  detailed  human  sorrows  and  joys.  Magnificently  staged  and  every  role,  major  and  minor,  is  outstandingly  done,  especially  the  comedy  bits  by  Beryl  Mercer,  Tempe  Pigott  and  Merle  Tottenham.

Mae  West  as  Sady  Lou,  a  Bowery  moll  of  the  gay  nineties,  grabs  up  the  story  in  her  be-diamonded  hands  and  dominates  every  scene  from  the  moment  she  steps  her  buxom  self  into  the  film.

Bill  Boyd,  William  Gargan,  Creighton  Chaney  and  Billy  Bake-  well  are  the  fearless  stunt  boys,  with  Rosco  Ates  adding  a  bit  of  fun.  Dorothy  Wilson  does  some  nice  work  as  the  girl.  It  begins  with  a  bang,  ends  with  a  thrill  and  packs  plenty  of  punch  throughout  the  story.    HOT  PEPPER  —Fox    THE  BILLION  DOLLAR  SCANDAL—  Paramount    OERGEANT  QUIRT  and  Captain  Flagg  (otherwise  Edmund  •^Lowe  and  Victor  McLaglen)  are  with  us  again,  hard-boiled  as  ever.  This  time  they  run  the  gamut  from  a  crooked  crap  game  to  the  rum-running  business,  with  much  pepper  on  the  side  from  Lupe  Velez,  doing  a  South  American  dancer  in  a  night  club.  Creaks  somewhat  in  the  telling,  but  loads  of  fun.  We  might  add,  just  a  bit  rough.    SHADES  of  Teapot  Dome!  Here's  the  whole  oily  imbroglio  with  us  again,  in  an  excellent  thriller  worked  out  by  Robert  Armstrong,  as  an  ex-athlete  and  ex-convict  who  discovers  the  deal  and  braves  threats  on  his  life  to  expose  all.  Olga  Baclanova,  as  a  dizzy  manicurist  and  masseuse,  and  Constance  Cummings,  as  a  daughter  of  the  scheming  multimillionaire  (Frank  Morgan)  provide  satisfactory  romance.    Not  for  the  children.    cr  v.i   hi   '■   Al    60    Saves  Yo  ur   Picture    Time    and    Money    THE  PAST  OF  MARY  HOLMES—  RKO-Radio    PARACHUTE   JUMPER—   Warners    TOO  bad  for  Helen  MacKellar  that  Louise  Dresser  scored  so  mightily  in  "The  Goose  Woman"  several  years  ago,  for  Helen's  repetition  of  the  role  is  inevitably  dimmed.  Never-  theless, her  portrayal  of  the  half-mad,  gin-soaked  ex-opera  star  who  lives  alone  with  her  geese  until  a  murder  drags  her  to  no-  tice, is  gripping  enough.  Eric  Linden,  Sheets  Gallagher  and  J.  Carrol  Naish  help  plow  through  a  tangle  of  sub-plots.    WITH  a  vagabond  air  and  dash,  this  snappy  story  of  two  discharged  aviators  of  the  Marines,  hops  from  one  crazy  situation  to  another.  Douglas  Fairbanks,  Jr.,  and  Frank  McHugh  find  themselves  in  New  York,  jobless;  discover  Bette  Davis,  also  jobless,  and  together  they  go  aero-rum-running,  parachute  jumping  and  gangster  chasing.  Fairbanks,  grand;  Bette  Davis,  McHugh  and  Leo  Carrillo  add  plenty  of  interest.    THE   MYSTERIOUS  RIDER—  Paramount    HELLO,  EVERYBODY!  — Paramount    BY  dint  of  using  such  actors  as  Irving  Pichel  and  Warren  Hymer  to  support  Kent  Taylor  and  Lona  Andre,  this  one  turns  the  usual  Western  formula  into  good  enough  melodrama  for  anybody.  Director  Fred  Allen  also  did  a  lot  to  make  some-  thing highly  satisfactory  from  the  Zane  Grey  plot,  which  has  to  do  with  a  night  rider  foiling  the  attempts  of  a  crooked  lawyer  to  grab  the  homesteaders'  lands.    STRICTLY  for  Kate  Smith  fans — all  four  million  of  'em.  It's  a  simple  country  yarn,  tailored  to  fit  Katie,  which  takes  some  tailoring.  In  it  she's  the  farmers'  friend,  who  uses  her  head  and  the  voice  God  gave  her  to  foil  the  wicked  power  in-  terests, out  to  dam  the  farmers'  water.  Several  good  songs  in  Kate's  best  manner,  and  she  brings  down  the  house  with  her  dance  routine.    Excellent  cast.

HALLE-  LUJAH,  I'M  A  BUM—  United  Artists    PREPARE  to  shiver  when  you  see  this  Technicolor  successor  to  "Doctor  X."  Lionel  Atwill,  as  a  wax  museum  owner,  crazed  and  horribly  mutilated  by  a  fire,  invades  New  York  with  a  gruesome  (and  lethal)  method  of  obtaining  figures  for  his  show.  Fay  Wray  is  all  but  snuffed  out  before  all  is  set  right.  Glenda  Farrell,  Frank  McHugh,  Holmes  Herbert  and  Allen  Vincent  excellent  in  support.    Don't  take  the  kiddies.    NO  great  shakes  as  a  story,  but  if  you  go  for  Al  Jolson,  you  should  get  a  kick  from  the  swell  music  and  lyrics  present.  Al,  as  "King  of  Central  Park,"  or  in  other  words,  head  of  the  bums,  delivers  the  ditties  as  incidents  of  his  effort  to  straighten  out  a  tangled  heart-affair  between  the  mayor  of  New  York  (Frank  Morgan)  and  his  girl  (Madge  Evans).   [  ADDITIONAL  REVIEWS  ON  PAGE   123  ]   61    Mary  Returns  To  Herself    "My  greatest  difficulty, "  says  Mary  Pickford,  "is  keeping  busy.  This  is  complicated  by  the  fact  that  I  am  an  artist-producer."  Unlike  the  big  film  companies,  every  picture  that  she  produces  has  to  make  money    WITH  the  screen  as  her  blackboard  and  pretty  clothes  and  romance  her  chalk,  Mary  Pickford  is  re-draw-  ing the  outline  of  her  career.   She  is  strengthening  that  delicate  fabric  of  lines  which  fits  together  with  jig-saw  puzzle  precision  to  form  the  pattern  of  her  cinematic  fate.   To  protect  that  image,  Mary  is  returning  to  herself.   But  she  does  not  view  this  return  with  any  undue  alarm.  On  the  contrary,  she  regards  it  definitely  as  a  step  forward.  And  she  feels  that  the  very  implication  of  the  word  return  rings  false.  In  fact,  she  will  have  none  of  it,  claiming  it  in  no  sense  applies  to  the  current  Pickford  status.   '"To  say  that  I  am  returning  to  myself  infers,"  she  said,  "that  I  am  going  back  to  little  girl  roles  such  as  were  shown  in  'Little  Annie  Rooney,'  or  'Sparrows,'  or  even  'My  Best  Girl,'  and  I  assure  you  I  haven't  the  slightest  intention  of  that.  Also,  to  return,  one  must  have  been  away,  and  I  have  been  right  here  in  pictures  all  the  time,  looking  for  new  stories,  selling  old  ones,  and  planning,  always  planning."   Mary  Pickford  believes  it  an  ill-found  philosophy  which  dwells  upon  the  discussion  of  mistakes;  also  she  thinks  that  absence  from  the  screen  and  not  so  much  bad  pictures  is  the  thing  that  jeopardizes  a  film  career.   "Irving  Thalberg  once  told  me  that  you  can't  always  be  right  but  you  can  always  be  busy,  which  is  indeed  a  sage  re-  mark. No  one's  judgment  is  infallible.  It  isn't  the  mistakes  you  make  that  down  you,  it's  the  inactivity.  No  one  can  stand  still  and  go  ahead.  And  you  can't  move  forward  and  look  backward.    You  go  in  the  direction  you  look.   62    But  not  the  self  of  curls  and  "Little  Annie  Rooney'  roles.  Much  deeper  than  that,  it  is  a  matter  of  the  spirit   By  Mark  Lark  in    "Defeat  is  not  important  unless  it  brings  discouragement.  It  is  dis-  couragement that  keeps  you  from  trying,  not  defeat.  Discouragement  brings  hopelessness,  and  hopeless-  ness brings  oblivion.  The  antidote  for  both  is  activity."   All  this  comment  came  amid  a  whirl  of  activity  which  marked  the  completion  of  "Secrets,"  at  least  the  shooting  of  "Secrets."  Mary  sat  at  a  makeshift  table  sipping  tea  and  eating  a  wafer  while  Frank  Borzage,  filmland's  prize-winning  director,  and  Ray  June,  runner-up  cameraman,  were  changing  the  set-  up.   Old  Man  Budget,  grizzled  buga-  boo of  the  business  office,  peered  from  recesses  and  croaked  his  dis-  mal refrain,   "Overhead,"  driving  gaffer,  juicers,  grips,  boom-men  and  sound  crew  at  a  frantic  pace.   Mary  talked  fast,  for  soon  Borzage  would  want  her  to  take  a  make-believe  ride  across  the  continent  on  the  Lincoln  High-  way with  Leslie  Howard  for  the  fadeout  of  the  picture.  The  car  stood  ready  for  this  final  close-up,  an  elopement  scene  be-  tween two  characters  already  married  in  the  script.   "The  first  thing  to  consider  about  any  story,"  Mary  said,  "is  its  entertainment  value.  Next,  whether  the  vehicle  fits.  A  good  story,  no  matter  how  well  done,  in  which  the  star  is  miscast  is  never  entertaining.  Nor  is  a  bad  story,  regardless  of  how  excellently  produced.  And  there  is  no  such  thing  as  'type  of  entertainment.'  A  good  war  picture  will  succeed  today,  or  a  good  gangster  picture,  or  a  good  sex  picture.  But  it  must  be  good.   "(~\V  course,  people  do  get  tired  of  seeing  the  same  old  story  Wover  and  over  in  different  theaters,  or  the  same  players  over  and  over  in  practically  the  same  roles.  A  'cycle'  of  pictures  is  nothing  but  a  series  made  from  the  same  plot  with  slight  changes.  The  same  players  are  featured  in  the  same  type  roles  until  the  public  gets  sick  of  seeing  them!  "   The  greatest  difficulty  that  confronts  Miss  Pickford  is  keep-  ing active,  she  explained.  "This  is  complicated  by  the  fact  that  I  am  an  artist-producer.  Although  I  am  a  company,  I  also  am  an  individual.  All  the  big  companies  with  their  many  stars  and  featured  players,  make  fifty-two  pictures  a  year,  while  I,  the  Mary  Pickford  Company,  a  lone  star,  am  fortunate  to  do  one."

Myrna  wears  this  in  black  but  you  may  choose  it  in  soft  tones,  as  well.

Bi    ess    You,  IVly  Child    ren    f    Alec  B.  Francis  can  say  that  to  almost  all  the  stars  you  know.  He's  been  screen-  father  to  them  all   By   Harold  Benton    KING  SOLOMON  was  famous  because  of  his  wives.  Peggy   Hopkins  Joyce  is  fa-  mous because  of  her  husbands.   A  lot  of  youngsters  are  famous  be-  cause of  their  parents —   But  the  most  famous  father  in  film  history  is  Alec  B.  Francis.   Any  father  would  be  swell-chested  in-  deed to  claim  Greta  Garbo,  Joan  Craw-  i:  rd,  Norma  Shearer  or  Janet  Gaynor  as  his  daughter,  but  Alec  does  better  than  that.  He  claims  all  of  them.  They  are  merely  twigs  on  his  screen-family  tree,  a  few  of  the  scores  of  children  whom  he  has  fathered  in  some  picture  or  other.   He  has  been  at  it  for  twenty-two  years  now,  and  that  gives  him  considerable  of  an  edge  over  any  other  screen  parent.   He  began  it  back  in  the  days  when  the  movies  were  made  in  Flatbush-on-the-  Hudson.   In  those  days  you  saw  Edith  Storey,  Florence  Turner,  Kitty  Gordon  and  Barbara  Tennant.  In  those  days  Mary  Pickford  hadn't  even  been  heard  of,  and  D.  W.  Griffith  was  still  sweeping  stages,  instead  of  staging  epic  cinema  sweeps.   Alec  started  raising  his  screen  brood  then.  Among  them  are  numbered  the  most  celebrated  youngsters  in  the  world.  For  Alec  has  played  father  not  only  to   almost  every  star  now  of  importance  on  the  screen,  but  to  almost  every  star  of  any  importance  who  has  ever  been  on  the  screen.   Lillian  Walker,  Elaine  Hammerstein,  Mae  Marsh,  Geraldine  Farrar,  Naomi  Childers,  Pauline  Frederick,  Ruth  Roland —  these  are  only  a  few  of  the  film  great  whom  he  raised.   AS  for  the  present  day  stars  whom  he  has  fathered — well,  just  list  about  all  there  are  in  alphabetical  order  and  look  'em  over  for  yourself.    Alec  won't  have  missed  many  of  them.   If  you  stroll  along  Hollywood  Boulevard  almost  any  bright,  sunny  morning,  the  odds  are  that  you'll  bump  into  him.  A  rather  tall,  white-haired  gentleman,  with  the  milk  of  human  kindness  all  over  his  face.  A  twinkle  in  his  pale  blue  eyes,  a  sprightly  step,  and  a  bit  of  a  feather  stuck  jauntily  into  the  band  of  his  hat.  He'll  be  carrying  a  stick  in  his  hand,  there'll  be  a  pipe  in  his  mouth,  and  he'll  bid  you  a  cheery  good-day.  And  as  like  as  not,  if  you  can  keep  up  with  him,  he'll  tell  you  a  reminiscence  or  two.    Is  Alec  proffering  some  sound,  fatherly  advice?  Well,  when  he  does,  all  Hollywood  loves  it.  After  he's  finished  "daddying"  them  on  the  screen,  the  stars  have  come  to  like  him  so  well  they  simply  love  to  take  their  business  cares,  heartaches,  and  what  have  you,  to  him  in  real  earnest  for  solution    Really,  he's  one  of  those  gentle,  lovable  creatures  that  can  be  created  only  by  God  or  Sir  James  Barrie.  That's  why  every  star  with  whom  he  has  ever  worked  adores  him  and  confides  in  him  not  only  her  screen  joys  and  troubles,  but  often  her  real  life  ones  as  well.   "I  think  that  perhaps  Geraldine  Farrar  was  the  most  inter-  esting of  my  screen  children,"  he'll  tell  you,  "while  Naomi  Childers  possessed  the  most  exquisite  grace  and  poise.  ^Ye  used  to  gather  under  Geraldine's  window  when  I  was  working  with  her,  because  she  always  sang  in  her  dressing-room,  and  we  would  stay  there  for  hours  just  to  listen  to  her  sing."   Alec's  mind  is  a  rich  honeycomb  of  memories.  For  instance,  Kitty  Gordon  was  the  first  movie  star  to  receive  public  adula-  tion wherever  she  went,  and  that  was  not  because  she  was  in  pictures,  but  because  of  her  compelling  personality  itself  and  also  her  famous  back.   Mae  Marsh,  who  returned  to  the  screen  as  the  mother  in  "Over  the  Hill,"  was  for  many    [  please  turn  to  page  109  ]   71    So  Hollywood  Grot  Her/    THEY  said  a  lot  of  things  in  Dorothy  Peterson's  old  home-town  when  they  heard  that  she  had  gone  into  pictures.  It  made  no  difference  that  she  was  cast  in  sweet  mother  roles;  to  them  it  was  the  same  as  going  to — well,  the  permanent  abode  of  condemned  souls.  You  probably  saw  her  mothering  Constance  Bennett  in  "Bought,"  or  Dick  Barthelmess  in  "Cabin  in  the  Cotton,"  but  the  home-  towners  never  did.   For  Dorothy  Peterson's  home-town  is  Zion,  Illinois,  and  to  all  who  dwell  in  Zion,  pleasures  and  pastimes  such  as  dancing  or  the  movies  are  pitfalls  of  the  devil.   You've  probably  heard  of  Zion  and  of  "King"  John  Alexander  Dowie,  its  founder,  high  priest,  and  prophet.  You  probably  know  that  he  was  a  modern  "miracle  man"  whose  followers  flocked  to  his  healing  cult.  They  flocked  to  Zion  by  the  thousands — and  among  those  who  flocked  were  Dorothy's  parents.    At  the  time,  she  was  a  little  girl  of  six.   Dowie  is  dead,  now.     He  died  while  Dorothy  was  a  child.  But  Zion  is  still  going  strong.      Even   as  Elijah's   mantle   72    Dorothy  Peterson  lived  where  short  sleeves,  danc-  ing and  movies  were  for-  bidden by  law.  She  fled  to  Hollywood,  and  the  home-towners  have  never  quite  forgiven  her  for  it    By   Richard  Ta  Ibot    descended  to  his  successor,  Elisha,  in  the  Old  Testament,  so  Dowie's  prestige  descended  upon  the  present  General  Overseer  Yoliva.  Dorothy  re-  members Yoliva  well.  Every  Sunday,  back  in  Zion,  she  had  to  go  and  hear  him  preach  whether  she  wanted  to  or  no.  His  austere  tenets  were  the  terror  of  her  childhood.  His  rigorous  discipline  dominated  her  father  and  her  mother  and,  through  them,  herself  until  she  was  eighteen.   Movie  folk  have  come  from  everywhere.  They've  come  from  before  the  thrones  of  emperors  and  from  behind  the  steering  wheels  of  trucks;  they've  been  grand  duchesses  and  waiters.  But  of  all  the  film  players  in  Hollywood,  Dorothy  Peterson  undoubtedly  has  the  strangest  background  of  the  lot.  She  came  to  the  home  of  glamour  and  tins;l  from  the  home  cradle  of  a  re-  ligious colony.   ZION  is  perhaps  the  one  place  on  earth  where  there  are  still  no  movie  theaters.  There  are  movie  theaters  in  Zanzibar  and  Timbuktu.  The  Dyaks  of  Borneo  and  the  aborigines  of  Austalia  have  seen  Garbo  and  Gable  in  pictures.  But  in  the  United  States  of  America,  within  forty  miles  of  the  city  of  Chicago,  there  exists  today  a  community  of  over  5,000  souls,  not  one  of  whom  ever  sees  a  motion  picture  or  ever  hears  of  a  movie  star.  Well,  hardly  ever,  anyway.   Dorothy  Peterson  came  to  as    an    actress — ■    carried  a  teachings    Hollywood  from  there.   In  Zion,  Dorothy   volume  of  Dowie's   under   her   arm   instead   of   a   make-up  box.    She  got  up  and   went  to  bed  at  the  hours  Dowie   had  prescribed.     She  dressed  her  hair  as  Dowie  had  directed;   no  powder  ever  touched  her  cheeks  or  rouge  her  lips.     There   were  no  parties — just  prayer-meetings  there.   In  Zion,  Dowie  decreed  even  what  and  when  she  should  eat.  He  specified  the  foods  which  were  best  for  her  soul— and  she  had  to  eat  them,  too,  because  the  Board  of  Elders  and  the  Council  of  the  Apostles  ran  the  stores.  Contrast  that  with  naughty  Hollywood!  Dorothy  went  to  Zion  because  her  mother  became  a  convert  to  the  Zionist  faith.

He's  a  quiet,  unassuming  young  man  with  a  bright  Irish  wit,  who  lives  alone  in  a  modest  flat  with  his  dog,  likes  golf  and  tennis  and  goes  bicycle  riding  every  chance  he  gets.  He  cares  little  for  publicity  ballyhoo  and  wants  to  spread  his  career  out  over  a  period  of  years,  rather  than  have  it  burst  into  a  sud-  den skyrocket  of  flame  and  then  die  out.   The  amazing  thing  is,  his  real  name  is  Hollywood  and  his  mother's  name  was  Warner,  and  today  he's  a  Warner  star  in  Hollywood.  Seems  like  a  nice  bit  of  foresight,  doesn't  it,  on  the  part  of  the  fates?  But  not  so,  not  so.  Not  at  all.  It  made  no  end  of  trouble  when  his  time  came  to  flash  upon  the  screen,  and  had  to  be  ripped  all  to  bits.   Of  that,  more  anon.  Mean-  while, to  save  bother,  we'll  call  him  Lyle  Talbot  throughout.   Born  in  Pittsburgh,  Pennsyl-  vania, he  moved  to  a  small  town  in  Nebraska  when  he  was  still  a  baby,  and  later  moved  to  the  city  of  Omaha.  His  par-  ents were  on  the  stage  and  Lyle  lived  with  his  grandmother.   Never  dreamed,  of  course,  that  he'd  be  anything  but  Lyle  Hollywood  to  the  end  of  his  days.  But  "  Man  Proposes —  "  you  know  how  it  runs.  Mean-  while, some  early  ups  and  downs  of  his  career.   Graduating  from  high  school  in  Omaha,  he  set  out  in  his  par-  ents' footsteps  and  joined  a  small  stock  company.  Later,  at  his  grandmother's  urging,  he  attended  the  University  of  Nebraska,  but  his  brief  taste  of  the  stage  was  too  strong  to  re-  sist, so  he  left  college  to  travel  as  a  hypnotist's  assistant.  Knowing  no  more  about  hyp-  notism, of  course,  than  your  dear  old  grandmother.   He  graduated  to  tent  shows  that  played  through  the  Middle  West  and  for  three  years  Lyle  was  that  handsome  young  juvenile  who  knocked  them  right  out  of  their  seats.  Soon  after,  he  owned  his  own  stock  company  in  Memphis,  Tennessee.   Things  looked  bright  until  the  stage  hands  upped  and  went  on  strike  and  Lyle  was  left  to  shift  his  own  scenery  and  arrange  his  own  props.  So  he  finally  gave  up  in  despair.  Knocked  out,  so  to  speak,  just  when  that  siren  Prosperity  was  promising  to  come  tiptoeing  around  the  corner.  His  name  still  stands  on  the  front  of  that  Memphis  theater,  where  a  burlesque  company  now  holds  forth.  That  is,  at  last  reports.  We  can't  guarantee  how  things  might  change  in  times  like  these.  But  back  to  our  subject,  and  his  next  steps  up  the  ladder  to  fame.    But  Lyle  Talbot  wishes  they  would  let  him  go  straight    By    Sara    In  all  his  acting  career  Lyle  had  never  seen  New  York,  when  suddenly  he  was  asked  to  join  a  stock  company  in  Man-  chester, England.  He  played  there  a  short  time  and  then  re-  turned to  make  Broadway  at  last,  playing  in  "The  Criminal  Code."  While  playing  in  New  York,  he  made  a  Warner  Bros,  short  that  brought  no  results,  so  he  put  the  thought  of  movies  out  of  his  head.  From  New  York  he  journeyed  to  Dallas,  Texas,  to  join  the  famous  stock  company  playing  that  city.   News  of  the  young  actor  who  was  wowing  them  in  Dallas  soon  reached  Hollywood,  and  the  Warner  star-hounds  sent  for  him  to  come  on  and  make  a  test.  So  Lyle  arrived,  thrilled  but  speechless.  He  had  lost  his  voice  en  route  and  could  only  gasp  things  at  an  as-  tounded studio.   Recovering  his  voice,  he  made  the  necessary  tests,  giv-  ing scenes  from  the  play,  "Louder  Please."  That  was  where  fate  had  another  little  joke  all  ready  for  him.  He  went  through  it  blissfully  un-  aware that  the  play  burlesqued  certain  people  in  certain  de-  partments of  the  very  studio  that  was  testing  him.   DISCOVERING,  to  his  hor-  ror, two  days  later  what  had  happened,  he  quickly  packed,  ready  to  sneak  out  of  town,  when  Warners,  amused  at  the  whole  episode,  promptly  signed  him  to  a  contract.  His  first  role  was  in  "Love  Is  A  Racket."  You've  seen  him  in  "No  More  Orchids"  with  Car-  ole Lombard;  "Ladies  Thev  Talk  About"  and  "42nd  Street."   And  that,  mates,  is  where  the  cinematic  name  met  its  fate.  "Hollywood  of  Holly-  wood " — "  Hollywood  was  born  in  Pittsburgh"—  no,  it  just  wouldn't  do.  So  Lyle  Holly-  wood became  Lyle  Talbot.  Everyone  happy — just  like  that.  Now  a  few  details,  since  our  hero  has  landed.   He's  five  feet,  eleven  and  a   half  inches  tall;  weighs  172   pounds,   has  brown  hair  and   blue  eyes  that  a  girl  would  give  anything  to  possess.     He  has   grand  taste  in  clothes,  his  ties,  socks  and  shirts  always  blending.   He  is  never  seen  where  actors  are  usually  seen.    He  drives  a   Ford,  loves  filet  of  sole,  and  his  pet  economy  is  cheap  socks.   He  loathes  people  who  talk  too  much.     Lyle  himself  talks   well  and  at  length.   He's  made  fourteen  pictures  in  eight  months   and  frets  considerably  about  the  villain  thing.    He  never  wants   to  be  just  a  nice  young  hero  but  he  would  like  to  be  a  little   nice  on  the  screen  for  a  change.   Hamilton        .

Bet  he  will  give  us  a  bigger  smile  when  he  hears  about  this    TOMMY  CONLON  is  the  readers'  favorite  this  month.  Although  he  is  just  a  lad  of  fifteen,  everyone,  young  and  old,  is  asking  for  information  about  him.  And  here  it  is!  Tommy  was  born  in  Philadelphia,  Penna.,  on  June  21,  1917.  He  is  of  Irish-American  descent.  Has  auburn-brown  hair  and  blue  eyes.  It  is  hard  to  tell  just  what  his  height  and  weight  are  because  he  is  [growing  so  fast.  Back  in  1924,  Tommy  began  his  picture  career  in  "Our  Gang"  comedies.  Later  he  appeared  in  a  number  of  serials  for  Universal.  Then  he  left  pictures  for  three  years  and  lived  in  the  East  with  his  father.  He  returned  to  the  screen  in  1931  when  Fox  gave  him  the  rule  of  Johnny  in  "Over  the  Hill."

Naval  Academy,  An-  napolis, Md. — The  name  of  the  little  lady  who  made  such  a  hit  with  the  midshipmen  was  Elizabeth    Allan.      She    played    the    role    of   84    Sylvia  with  Leslie  Howard  and  Benita  Hume  in  "Reserved  for  Ladies."  Benita  was  the  Countess  Ricardi.  In  1927,  Adolphe  Menjou  and  Kathryn  Carver  made  the  silent  version  of  this  picture  which  was  released  under  the  title  "Service  for  Ladies."     Remember?   Dorothy,  Los  Angeles,  Calif. — What  a  popular  fellow  Cary  Grant  is  becoming!  He  is  a  native  of  Bristol,  England,  born  there  on  January  18  (doesn't  tell  the  year).  He  is  6  feet,  V/2  inches  tall;  weighs  174  pounds  and  has  black  hair  and  brown  eyes.  He  appeared  on  the  English  as  well  as  the  American  stage  before  he  went  into  pictures  in  December,  1931.  His  real  name  is  Archie  Leach.  Like  Cary  Grant  better?

He  was  born  there  on  November  5,  1905.  Is  6  feet,  2  inches  tall;  weighs  185  pounds  and  has  brown  hair  and  blue  eyes.

Dorothy  Williams,  New  Orleans,  La. —  The  beautiful  Claudette  Colbert  was  born  in  Paris,  France,  on  September  13,  1907.     She  is   5  feet,  4  inches  tall;  weighs  112  pounds  and  has  very  dark  brown  hair  and  dark  brown  eyes.  Is  married  to  Norman  Foster.  Claudette  made  a  name  for  herself  on  the  stage  before  she  entered  pictures  in  1928.  Deserted  them  for  the  stage  for  a  while,  but  came  back  to  the  screen  with  the  talkies.  Don't  miss  seeing  her  with  Freddie  March  in  "Tonight  is  Ours."  But  remember  that  doesn't  mean  you  should  play  hookey  from  school.   Jack  Diether,  Vancouver,  B.

In  the  picture  the  role  of  Dakkar  was  played  by  Lionel  Barrymore;  Sonia  by  Jane  Daly;  Nikolai  by  Lloyd  Hughes;  Falcon  by  Montagu  Love;  Mikhail  by  Harry  Gribbon;  Anion  by  Snitz  Edwards;  Dmitry  by  Gibson  Gowland  and  Teresa  by  Dolores  Brinkman.

The  three  girls  at  the  switch-  board are  known  to  radio  listeners  as  "Major,  Sharp  and  Minor."   R.  M.  C,  Jamaica,  Long  Island. — I  agree  with  you  that  Lewis  Stone  was  rather  foolish  to  throw  the  golden  sword  into  the  sea  in  the  picture  "The  Mask  of  Fu  Manchu."  Anyway,  it  will  probably  give  some  ambitious  writer  a  plot  for  another  story.  You  know  the  kind —  "Fu  Manchu"  as  a  deep-sea  diver.   Ruth  Lauren,  Dayton,  O. — Ann  Dvorak  was  born  on  August  7,  1912.     She  is  5  feet,   6  inches  tall  and  weighs  110  pounds.  Karen  Morley  weighs  106  pounds.

By  his  insolence.    Or  by  his  superior,  critical  attitude.   Characterize  these  men  in  a  general  way,  and  you'll  find  that  they're  suave  and  very  sophisticated.  Even  slick.  That  they  pretend  not  to  give  a  faded  gardenia  if  women  go  for  them  in  a  big  way  or  not.   If  they're  the  glib  penthouse  variety,  they  dress  like  an  ad-  vertisement of  what  the  well-groomed  man  will  wear  this  spring,  and  talk  like  an  edition  of  Walter  Winchell  or  Noel  Coward.  In  bright,  glittering  epigrams.  With  pat  remarks  which  have  a  more  insidious  influence  over  their  desired  vic-  tims than  any  Olympic  champion,  physique-of-Hercules  chap  could  ever  hope  to  gain.   'Way  back  in  the  good  old  days,  Type  I   there  was  Adolphe  Menjou,  raising  his  inimitable  eyebrows  and  twirl-  ing his  rapier-like  mustache  in  "The  Woman  of  Paris,"  "The  Ace  of  Cads,  "in  "Men  Call  It  Love."  He  had  what  is  known  as  "savoirfaire."  He  made  love  conversationally  in  the  beginning.  Oh,  so  provoca-  tively! All  the  while  looking  at  the  lady  in  question  with  half-closed  eyes.  Like  a  cat.  And  just  as  smart,  too.    TODAY,  there's  George  Raft  in  "Night  After  Night"  and  "Under-cover  Man."   In  the  former  picture,  Georgie  as  the  eminently  successful  but  discontented  speakeasy  proprietor  sees  the  goal  of  his  social  ambi-  tions and  the  living  vision  of  his  romantic  dreams  in  an  orchi-  daceous Park  Avenue  damsel  (Constance  Cummings).  But  when  he  discovers  that  her  impetuous  kiss,  which  so  ballooned  his  hopes,  means  no  more  to  her  than  it  would  to  any  lady  with  evenings  for  sale,  he  does  a  disgust  act  in  the  grand  manner.  He  snaps  his  fingers  at  her  and  all  her  silken  sisters  with  mag-  nificent insolence,  telling  her  off  in  a  lashing  speech  which  brings  the  lady  to  his  abode  in  double  quick  time  a  nd  in,  oh,  what  a  state  of  piqued  rage!   In  other  words,  ladies,  the  foxy  George  knew  what  he  was  doing!  He  realized  that  this  sort  of  treat-  ment usually  brings  about  a  kind  of  agitation  in  a  woman  which  is  often  nothing  more  nor  less  than  love  or  passion  turned  inside  out!    THINK  of  the  host  of  pictures  in  which  this  type  of  despot  just  de-  scribed flaunts  his  way  gayly  or  ar-  rogantly through  reels  of  silver  screen.    While  languishing  ladies,  or   those  pretending  an  irritation  which  they  really  don't  feel,  "give  their  all"  and  beg  for  more  of  the  same  domineering  shameless  treatment!  The  William  Powell  and  Warren  Wil-  liam type.   And  how  their  women  suffer!  If  ZaSu  Pitts  were  writing  this  article,  she'd  just  wilt  and  groan:  "O  .  .  uh — uh,  mi  .  .  iy  de  .  .  ah  .  .  r, "  and  you'd  know  exactly  what  she  meant!   Sometimes,  though,  this  type  is  harder  to  define.  Because  he  conquers  his  willing  prey  by  a  more  indirect  method.  He  has  a  sad  air  of  mystery.  An  unvoiced  suggestion  of  a  glamor-  ous past.     He's  quiet  and  restrained.

He  knows  what  he  wants  and  goes  after  it  in  somewhat  primitive  fashion.  Ex-  amples: Clark  Gable;  Jimmy  Cagney;  Johnny  Weissmuller;  Chester  Morris.   (b)  The  suave,  highly  sophisticated  man  of  the  world.  He's  often  indifferent;  sometimes  slightly  insolent;  usually  keeps  his  women  guessing.  Examples:  Adolphe  Menjou;  George  Raft;  William  Powell.   (c)  The  lover  of  many  moods,  chief  among  which  is  glamour  and  mystery.  Examples:  Ronald  Colman;  John  Gilbert.   Type  II   The  Gentler,  to  be-mastered  Male:  Shyer,  less  assertive  and  more  "virginal"  type  of  lover.     Usually  dominated  by  a  woman.   (a)  The  immature,  inexperienced  boyish  lover.  Often  awkward  and  bashful;  he  arouses  a  woman's  maternal  instinct,  her  sense  of  pity  and  desire  to  protect.  Ex-  amples: Charles  Farrell;  Richard  Crom-  well; Eric  Linden.   (b)  The  wise-cracking,  gay,  nonsensical  lover,  with  inhibitions  and  a  large  slice  of  senti-  mentality. Examples:  Robert  Montgom-  ery, Jack  Oakie;  Lee  Tracy.   (c)  The  sensitive,  romantic,  idealistic  lover;  cultured  and  often  poetic.  A  more  spiritual,  self-sacrificing  type.  His  love  is  cf  a  higher  order,  often  relinquishing  its  own  self-  interests  for  the  sake  of  another.  Examples:  Leslie  Howard;  Ramon  Novarro;  Phillips  Holmes;  Richard  Barthelmess.    provokes  women  to  grades  of  folly  which  are  nothing  short  of  epic.   That's  your  Ronald  Colman  in  many  roles.     In  "Arrow-  smith,  "  in  "  Cynara. "   Ronnie  is  always  a  bit  out  of  reach!    Either,  as  in  "Arrow-  smith,"  his  love  of  his  profession  comes  first  in  his  life  (it  hap-  pened to  be  medical  research  in  this  case)  and  thus  shuts  out  the  woman  who  adores  htm  and  would  sacrifice  anything  for  his  sake  .  .  .  even  her  life,  which  she  actually  does.    Or,  as  in  "Cynara,"  the  someone  else  (Kay  Francis,  wife  of  the  barrister,  Ronald    Colman)    who   permanently   occupies   his   heart   de-  spite his  passionate  excursion  .  .  .  always  keeps  him  spirit-  ually remote  from  the  little  shop  girl    (Phyllis   Barry)    to   whom   he  makes  love.   In  other  words,  if  a  man  closes  the  doors  of  part  of  his  life  to  the  woman  who  loves  him,  that  man  becomes  ever  more  desirable  to  her  .  .  .  because  unattainable.  It  seems  to  me  that  this  would  logically  ex-  plain the  domination  that  the  reti-  cent, the  mysterious,  the  glamorous  male  has  for  numberless  women.  What  one  doesn't  know  or  under-  stand completely  is  always  much  more  exciting  than  what  is  obvious!   Well,  'fess  up!  Do  you  enjoy  suf-  fering at  the  hands  of  these  expe-  rienced devastators?  If  so,  after  what  we've  said,  you  should  have  your  own  number,  so  to  speak.    AS  far  as  we're  concerned,  the  type,  just  mentioned,  is  far  more  provocative  and  galvanizing  than  the  big,  burly,  thews-and-sinew  ani-  mal-magnetism chap.  But  tastes  differ.    And  how!   Completely  the  opposite  of  these  intriguing  tyrants  are  the  lads  who  appeal  to  the  woman  who,  herself,  strongly  desires  to  be  conqueror.   This  woman  wants  to  dominate!  She  may  merely  show  signs  of  an  active,  maternal  instinct.  Or  she  may  actually  possess  certain  defi-  nite masculine  characteristics.  No  matter  what  the  subconscious  mo-  tive— this  type  of  woman  finds  her  heart  shattered  by  such  delicate,  rather  helpless  Princes  Charming  as  Charles  Farrell,  Richard  Cromwell  and  Eric  Linden.   Let  these  lads  open  wide  their  dewy,  boyish  eyes;  let  them  merely  fumble  at  their  hats  and  choke  a  bit  when  about  to  skate  around  the  burning  question,  and  emotional  havoc  takes  place  in  their  female  devotees!   Suddenly,  across  my  mind  flashes  the  story  of  Charles  Farrell.     The  wistful,  boyish  screen  lover  who  didn't  marry  his  girl  sweet-  heart, Janet  Gaynor;  but  instead  married  Virginia  Valli.   A  mother  type?     Possibly.   Some  clever  men  deliberately  play  the  role  of  the  naive,  bashful  boy,  because  they  know  so  well  what  ravages  they  can  work  with  a  woman's  heart  when  they  appeal  to  her  on  the  basis  of  her  pity  and  sympathy.  Fie  upon  you,  you  delightful,  sinister  racketeers!   Then  there's  another  kind  of  "little  boy"  man  whose  every  glance  makes  the  mother  instinct  rear  its  rampant  head.

They  figured  that  after  all  her  good  work  since  she  came  to  Holly-  wood, she  rated  a  nice  vacation,  so  Miss  Wynvard  departed  for  her  native  England  a  short  time  ago,  where  she  will  remain  until  June.   88    QO  Eddie  Sutherland  is  married  again — for  ^the  fourth  time.  Dear,  dear,  we  can  re-  member Eddie  when  he  didn't  have  a  wife  to  his  name.  Not  so  long  ago,  either.  Only  about  ten  years.  In  those  days  he  was  courting  May  McAvoy,  in  spirited  competition  with  Bobby  Agnew.  May  married  neither  of  them,  and  Bobby  never  married  at  all.  Probably  figures  Eddie  is  doing  enough  in  the  matrimonial  line  for  both  of  them.

It  seems,  none  of  them  had.   "Well,  gee,  that's  funny,"  the  actor  said.  "Someone  came  home  with  me  and  finished  my  jig-saw  puzzle  before  he  left.

TTIE  rumor  persists  that  the  real  reason  for  the  reconciliation  of  the  Adolphe  Menjous,  practically  halting  her  attorney  on  the  court-  house steps,  divorce  complaint  in  hand,  is  that  she  is  going  to  present  Adolphe  with  an  heir  sometime  in  the  summer.

Cal  York's  Monthly  Broadcast  from  Hollywood    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  88    JEAN  HARLOW  has  not  been  sitting  around  ^  idly  while  M-G-M  decided  what  her  next  picture  was  to  be.  She  kept  as  busy  as  any  little  housewife,  selecting  furniture  and  mak-  ing drapes  to  go  in  her  new  home  out  in  Holmby  Hills,  where  she  will  live  with  her  parents,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Marino  Bello.   Jean  is  living  very  quietly  these  days.  She  went  down  to  Caliente  over  New  Year's,  but  most  of  her  recreation  consists  of  going  to  the  neighborhood  movie — even  as  you  and  I.   TDILL  POWELL  ran  into  two  friends  "^who  were  having  a  grand  time  swapping  symptoms.   Bill  listened  in  sympathetic  silence  — until  he  could  bear  it  no  longer.  "This  conversation  reminds  me  of  Mandy  and  Liza.   "Mandy  said,  'Liza,  has  you-all  evah  been  X-rayed?'   "Liza  thought  a  moment,  and  re-  plied, 'No,  but  I  been  ultra-violated  twice!'  "    "T  HAVE  lived  more  than  most  men,  and  I  ■*•  am  tired — so  tired!"  These  words  Jack  Pickford  whispered  in  the  American  Hospital  in  Paris,  where  he  died  January  3rd.  As  he  himself  said,  he  lived  so  intensely — crowding  into  his  thirty-six  years  of  life,  hundreds  of  joys  and  sorrows  that  less  volatile  souls  never  realize  in  a  lifetime  of  four  score  and  ten.   Born  John  C.  Smith,  in  Toronto,  Canada,  he  appeared  in  his  first  stage  production  while  still  wearing  long  baby  clothes.   At  the  age  of  23,  long  after  Mary  had  become  "America's  Sweetheart,"  and  after  a  brief  stage  career  of  his  own,  Jack  entered  the  films.   As  Jack  Smith,  he  worked  alongside  Mack  Sennett,  his  sister  Mary  Pickford,  and  Lillian  and  Dorothy  Gish  in  the  old  Biograph  Com-  pany.    For  $5  a  day!   TT  was  not  until  he  created  the  role  of  Tom  Sawyer  that  he  really  attracted  attention.  But  from  that  moment  on,  followed  a  suc-  cession of   triumphs   in   which   this  debonair    Claudette  Colbert's  motto  must  be  "If  at  once  you  don't  succeed,  try,  try  again!"  As  Empress  Poppaea  in  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross,"  she  vamped  Freddie  March  in  vain.  But  he's  finally  succumbed  to  her  wiles,  from  the  looks  of  this  rehearsal.  He  plays  the  royally  romantic  lover  to  her  charming  queen  in  "Tonight  Is   Ours,"  from  a  play  by  Noel  Coward   90    Those  faithful  fans  who  have  waited  patiently  for  the  return  of  their  favorite,  Mrs.  Wally  Reid,  are  finally  to  be  rewarded.  After  a  five  years'  absence,  she  re-appears  on  the  screen  to  play  a  tender  "mother"  role    in    "Diamond    Cut    Diamond"    youth  enthralled  so  many,  many  cinema  audiences  with  his  lovable  charm.   In  1920 — the  same  year  he  legally  adopted  the  name  Pickford,  which  had  already  been  trumpeted  through  the  world — he  began  his  mercurial  and  ill-fated  career  as  a  husband.   First  to  Olive  Thomas,  whose  young  life  was  cut  short  by  an  overdose  of  a  sedative.  Then,  two  years  later,  to  Marilyn  Miller,  of  "Sally"  fame.    They  were  divorced  in  1927.   His  divorce  in  1932  from  Mary  Mulhern,  young  Follies  beauty,  terminated  his  third  marriage  and  his  spectacular  marital  career.   So  lived  Jack  Pickford — swiftly,  recklessly,  impetuously.  Eternally  boyish  to  the  end —  when,  for  a  moment  there  flashed  across  his  thin,  lined  face  a  phantom  of  the  old  grin,  and  he  murmured,  so  faintly  that  his  nurse  could  scarcely  hear:  "The  world  owes  me  nothing,  now  does  it?"   Now,  in  a  crypt  at  Forest  Lawn  Cemetery,  in  Southern  California  Jack  Pickford  lies  for-  ever at  peace  beside  his  mother,  Mrs.  Charlotte  Pickford.   A  N  amazing  study  in  contrast — the  -'^•vivacious  Paulette  Goddard  and  Charles  Chaplin.  Paulette  is  young  and  lively.  Charlie  sober,  and  even  melancholy  at  times.  Paul-  ette's  once  platinum  locks  now  border  on  the  raven  hue.  Charlie's  once  raven  locks  are  now  as  platinum  as  Paulette's  were.   Yes,  the  brunette  Paulette  and  platinum  Charles,  certainly  come  in  for  their  share  of  attention  from  passers-by.

How  I  Gave  Constance  Cummings  a  New  Figure   [  CONTINUED  EROM  PAGE  55  ]    her  to  do,  and  I'm  passing  it  on  to  you  folks  who  need  only  the  bust  reduced.   For  three  days  do  this:  First  thing  in  the  morning  drink  six  ounces  of  buttermilk.  Drink  six  ounces  of  buttermilk  every  two  hours  all  day  long.  Then  at  night  have  a  dinner  about  like  this — small  juicy  steak,  potato,  two  vege-  tables, half  stalk  of  celery,  green  salad,  fresh  fruit  and  demi  tasse.  When  the  three  days  are  up  do  this:  First  thing  in  the  morning  take  six  ounces  of  orange  juice,  then  take  six  ounces  of  liquid  every  two  hours  for  the  rest  of  the  day.  This  liquid  may  be  a  choice  of  four,  taken  as  you  like — tomato  juice,  orange  juice,  grape-  fruit juice  or  water,  but  be  sure  to  get  in  at  least  two  glasses  of  tomato  juice  and  take  the  orange  juice  around  3  p.m.  for  it's  a  great  stimulant.  At  night  have  a  nice  dinner  about  like  the  one  I've  described.  This  covers  a  pe-  riod of  six  days  and  you'll  be  amazed  at  how  quickly  the  flesh  in  your  bust  will  disappear  if  you'll  just  do  it.   I  put  Connie  on  that  six  day  diet  and  it  was  marvelous  the  way  she  responded.  Her  com-  plexion improved  a  hundred  per  cent,  too.  That  diet  is  wonderful  for  the  complexion.  And  as  I  watched  her  getting  slimmer  and  losing  those  stubborn  muscles,  I  knew  she  couldn't  fail,  but  Hollywood  is  a  strange  town.  One  Saturday  night  as  I  was  treating  her  she  jumped  up  off  the  table  and  walked  across  the  floor  with  her  shoulders  all  hunched  together  and  with  quite  a  stoop.   "Sylvia,"  she  said,  "do  you  think  I  could  learn  to  walk  like  that?"    "Why,  of  course,"  I  said,  "anybody  can  learn  to  walk  in  that  frightful  way,  but  why  in  the  world  do  you  want  to?"   "Well,"  she  said,  "they  say  it  might  help  to  make  my  shoulders  look  less  broad  if  I  walked  that  way  in  front  of  the  camera."   "Don't  you  do  it,"  I  screamed,  "don't  you  dare  do  it.  The  minute  you  start  being  con-  scious of  yourself  in  front  of  the  camera,  the  minute  you  aren't  natural  and  easy — you're  licked. "  And  that's  true  in  real  life,  too.  Don't  any  of  you  girls  ever  stoop  or  draw  your  shoulders  together  just  because  you  want  to  look  shorter — or  for  any  other  reason.   But  I  knew  that  their  asking  her  to  walk  that  way  was  the  beginning  of  the  end.  Two  days  later  she  came  to  me  crying  pitifully.  "I'm  not  going  to  play  opposite  Ronald  Col-  man,"  she  said,  "I'm  heartbroken.  They  say  I'm  not  suited. "   "  A  ND  didn't  they  know  that  before  they  -*»-brought  you  here?"  I  asked.  "Not  suited,  eh?  You're  suited  as  far  as  talent  and  intelli-  gence go — you're  just  too  large-boned  for  Col-  man — that's  all.  But  there  are  plenty  of  stars  in  Hollywood  whose  leading  lady  you  could  be  and  for  whom  you  would  be  suited.  Now  what  are  you  going  to  do?  "   She  told  me  that  they  had  given  her  and  her  mother  tickets  back  to  New  York  and  she  sup-  posed that's  all  she  could  do — go  back.  And  then  suddenly  she  looked  up  and  said,  through  her  tears.  "But  I'm  not  going  back.  I'm  going  to  stay  and  show  them. "    Well,  I  gave  her  a  slap  on  the  back  you  could  have  heard  a  couple  of  blocks  (And  very  good  for  the  muscles  in  her  back  it  was,  too).  "Atta  girl,"  I  said,  "stay  and  fight  them  and  you'll  make  a  hit."   I  knew  what  Connie  had — spirit  and  talent  and  intelligence.  I  knew  she  would  be  a  suc-  cess.   And  hasn't  she  shown  them?  "Movie  Crazy"  and  "Night  After  Night"  put  her  on  top,  where  she  belongs.   She  gets  a  small  salary,  but  that  won't  be  for  long!   And  take  that  as  a  lesson,  you  girls.  There's  something  more  to  making  yourselves  beautiful  than  just  half-way  following  my  instructions.  Meeting  your  daily  problems  with  courage  and  spunk  will  give  your  face  character  and  make  you  a  real  personality.  Look  at  Connie  Cum-  mings and  take  courage.   She  wears  her  clothes  well  but,  because  of  her  athletic  build,  wears  mostly  tailored  clothes,  as  she  should.   Even  her  evening  clothes  are  tailored,  and  for  you  girls  with  broad  shoulders  her  manner  of  dressing  is  good  to  pattern.   But  what  I  want  you  girls  to  remember  is  that  you've  got  to  take  disappointments  in  life  with  a  fighting  spirit.  It  makes  you  better  looking.  And  I  wish  you  could  compare  the  Connie  Cummings  who  first  came  to  me  with  the  Connie  Cummings  of  today.  She  has  one  grand  figure  now  (and  you  can  have  the  same)  as  anybody  who  sees  her  on  the  screen  can  testify.    Answers  by  Sylvia    Reduce  Dear  Sylvia:   I've  always  been  inclined  to  be  fat  but  I  didn't  care  much.  Now  I'm  engaged  to  be  married  and  am  going  to  have  a  big  wedding  and  want  to  look  pretty  in  my  wedding  dress.  Do  you  think  I  can  lose  twenty  pounds  in  a  month?   M.  T.  R.,  Los  Angeles,  Calif.   I  know  you  can.  I  don't  advise  people  tak-  ing off  more  than  fifteen  pounds  in  one  month  — but  this  is  a  special  case  and  deserves  drastic  measures.  This  month  I  told  you  how  I  helped  Connie  Cummings  to  reduce  her  bust  by  going  on  a  three  day  buttermilk  diet,  but  you  can  reduce  your  entire  figure  by  another  butter-  milk diet.  Here  it  is:  For  three  days  drink  nothing  but  buttermilk,  six  ounces  every  two  hours.  Then  for  three  days  eat  three  meals  a  day,  but  light  ones,  avoiding  creamy  soups,  creamed  vegetables,  rich  foods,  pies,  pastries,  etc.  Don't  drink  water  with  your  meals  and  don't  eat  between  meals.  Then,  after  three  days,  go  back  to  buttermilk.  Do  this  until  you  have  lost  the  twenty  pounds.  I  hope  it's  a  beautiful  wedding  and  that  you  look  grand  in  your  white  satin  dress.   My  dear  Madame  Sylvia:   I've  been  on  the  diet  which  you  recom-  mended in  Photoplay,  for  several  months  with  great  success.  Xow  my  sixteen-year-old  daugh-  ter wants  to  lose  a  little  weight.  Do  you  think  it  would  be  harmful  for  her?   Mrs.  J.  J.  C,  Baton  Rouge,  La.   If  she  is  a  healthy  girl,  not  at  all.  On  my  diet  you  get  plenty  of  good  nourishing  food.  You  haven't  felt  weak  on  it,  have  you?   Insomnia  Dear  Sylvia:   I'm  coming  to  you  as  a  last  resort.    I  used   02    to  be  nice  and  plump,  but  lately  I've  lost  a  lot  of  weight  and  I  know  it's  because  I've  gotten  so  I  can't  sleep  at  night.  Please  help  me.   L.  W.,  Birmingham,  Ala.   I  don't  like  being  a  last  resort,  but  I  can  tell  you  how  to  sleep.  In  bed  at  night,  lie  on  your  stomach  and  with  your  fingers  work  up  and  down  your  spine.  Then  turn  over  on  your  back,  lie  straight  in  bed  and  relax  and  with  your  fingers  gently  massage  the  outer  corners  of  your  eyes  with  a  rotary  movement.  Press  slightly  as  you  do  this.  Then  with  your  hands  work  the  back  of  your  neck  and  the  back  of  your  shoulders  to  get  those  muscles  loosened  up.   Before  going  to  bed  drink  a  glass  of  grape-  fruit juice.  Relax  during  the  day  whenever  you  can,  and  whenever  you  feel  yourself  tight-  ening up,  massage  the  muscles  at  the  back  of  your  shoulders  and  neck  with  your  hands.  If  you  wake  up  in  the  wee  small  hours  of  the  morning  and  have  trouble  going  back  to  sleep,  don't  just  lie  in  bed  and  toss — get  right  up,  dress  and  read  or  walk  around  the  house  or  take  a  shower.  Do  anything,  but  don't  lie  in  bed  awake.  The  next  night  you'll  fall  right  off  to  sleep.  Don't  try  too  hard  to  go  to  sleep.  Let  it  come  naturally.   Pretty  Fingers  Dear  Sylvia:   My  fingers  have  been  made  blunt  by  con-  stant use  of  the  typewriter.     I  play  bridge  a  good  deal  and  would  like  to  have  pretty  hands.  D.  D.,  Billings,  Mont.   You  can  mold  the  flesh  on  your  fingers  ex-  actly as  you  can  any  other  part  of  your  body.  With  the  thumb  and  forefinger  of  one  hand  press  the  stubby  fingertip  tight,  and  pull  until  the  hand  with  which  you  are  massaging  slips    off  the  end  of  your  finger.  Press  hard — simply  squeeze  the  flesh  off  to  make  your  finger  ends  pointed.    This  can  be  done.   Give  each  finger  about  ten  minutes  of  this  treatment  a  day.  And  it  won't  hurt  to  mas-  sage the  whole  hand  with  lots  of  hand  lotion  on  it.  Work  at  your  fingers  as  if  you  were  pulling  on  a  tight  glove.  It's  grand  for  mold-  ing the  hands.   Rich  Foods  Dear  Sylvia:   My  husband  likes  fried  meat  and  rich  pastries.  So  do  I,  but  I've  been  trying  to  go  on  your  diet  and  it  is  certainly  hard  to  do  it  when  I  have  to  cook  the  things  I  like  for  my  husband  but  can't  eat  any  myself.   Please  tell  me  how  to  reduce  the  upper  part  of  my  arms,  particularly.   Mrs.  J.  T.,  Los  Angeles,  Calif.   Certainly,  it's  hard  to  see  foods  you  like  and  not  be  able  to  eat  them  but  that's  what  I've  been  trying  to  tell  you.  You've  got  to  have  courage  and  grit  to  be  beautiful.  And  you've  got  to  stop  whining.  I  suppose  you  think  it  wasn't  difficult  for  Connie  Bennett  to  leave  a  party  at  which  she  was  having  a  good  time  to  get  home  at  nine  o'clock!  But  she  did  it — and  even  a  professional  pastry  cook  can  keep  on  a  diet  if  she  really  wants  to.  Snap  out  of  it  and  stop  complaining.   To  reduce  the  upper  part  of  your  arms  stand  with  your  face  to  the  wall  and  reach  up  along  the  wall  with  your  hands.  Stand  on  tip-toe.  Do  this  in  your  stocking  feet.  Then,  slowly,  trying  to  keep  your  finger  tips  in  their  original  place  on  the  wall,  sort  of  wiggle  and  jerk  down  to  your  heels,  concentrating  on  keeping  your  fingers  high.  Of  course,  your  hands  will  move  slightly,  but  try  keeping  them  up.  You  can  feel  the  muscles  in  your  upper  arm  pulling  and  you  will  know  you  are  doing  the  exercise  cor-  rectly.

Phoebe    Foster    shows    you    how.   HAVE  you  ever  tried  a  talcum  or  dusting  powder  spray?  It  sends  a  cloud  of  powder  over  the  skin.    Eleanor  Holm  likes  hers.    OR  YOU  may  prefer  a  long-handled  pow-  der puff,  such  as  Dorothy  Jordan  is  using.  You  can  reach  every  inch  of  your  back  with  this.  A  cunning  gift  idea,  too.  And  any  girl     would    love    one.    T\  7TIO  wouldn't  like  to  have  Joan  Elondell's  W  personality?  Who  wouldn't  like  to  be  brimful  of  energy,  gay,  vivacious,  captivating,  pretty?  There  are  so  many  beautiful  girls,  charming  girls,  winsome  girls,  alluring  girls  on  the  screen,  but  I  can't  think  of  anyone  who  has  just  that  joyous  gaiety,  that  joic  de  vivre  of  Joan.   And  so  I  sought  her  out  in  the  Hotel  St.  Moritz.  breaking  in  on  her  honeymoon  (as  were  all  the  other  editors')  to  ask  Joan  just  what  she  could  tell  the  rest  of  us  about  that  Joan  Blondell  personality.   Joan,  attired  in  dark  blue  slacks,  light  blue  shirt,  was  ready  to  tell  all.  She  sleeps,  does  Joan,  hours  and  hours.  Sleep  is  the  secret  of  her  aliveness,  she  says.  Always  to  bed  early  when  she  is  working.  And  she  has  been  work-  ing straight  for  two  years.  Twenty-seven  pic-  tures in  that  time.  Divide,  and  you  will  see  that  she  has  done  more  than  a  complete  picture  every  month  for  two  years.   TT  is  trite,  perhaps,  but  true  that  all  the  big  -Hhings  of  life  are  very  simple  things,  after  all.  And  so  we  find  that  the  enviable,  desirable  at-  tributes of  this  little  actress  have  their  roots  in  the  simple  business  of  getting  plenty  of  sleep.  Unquestionably,  there  is  no  greater  beautifier  except  happiness.   Joan's  hair  is  golden  blonde,  her  round  eyes  are  grey-green,  violet  or  blue  on  occasions,  I  suspect,  and  her  skin  is  an  even,  golden  tone.  She  gave  me  a  skin  beauty  secret  that  almost  stunned  me.  After  removing  make-up,  she  covers  her  face  with  olive  oil,  leaves  it  on  a  few  minutes,  then  takes  a  handful  of  table  salt,   9J.    rubs  it  thoroughly  over  the  skin.  The  salt  she  removes  with  cold  water,  the  oil  with  tissues.  For  you  who  do  not  care  for  the  French  dress-  ing aspect  of  this  treatment,  I  can  tell  you  of  two  splendid  toilet  preparations  designed  for  exactly  the  purposes  of  the  oil  and  salt,  that  is  cleansing,  softening,  lubricating,  then  gently  scouring  off  that  dead  outer  cuticle,  which  has  a  very  drab,  deadening  effect  if  left  on  the  face.  When  Joan  becomes  very  tired — she  tries  to  see  that  this  docs  not  happen  often — she  stands  very  erect,  folds  her  arms  at  the  back,  elbows  as  high  as  possible,  takes  deep  breaths,  about  ten  of  them,  breathing  in  and  out  very  slowly.    FOR  a  month  I  have  been  run-  ning about,  collecting  little  gadgets  and  information  of  a  make-up  nature.  A  folder  full  of  these  things,  as  well  as  our  skin  leaflet  specializing  in  acne  and  blackhead  conditions  and  cur  folder  on  preparations  for  the  normal  skin  ere  yours  on  re-  quest. Send  a  stamped,  self-  addressed  envelope  to  Carolyn  Van  Wyck,  Photoplay,  221  West  57th    Street,    New    York   City.    It  gives  her  new  energy  to  begin  all  over  again  This  is  also  a  good  exercise  for  developing  the  chest,  overcoming  round  shoulders.  Do  it  be-  fore an  open  window  or  outdoors,  if  possible.   V\  THEN  you  see  "A  Farewell  to  Arms" — or  W  if  you  have  already  seen  it  you  may  recall —  that  strange,  luminous  beauty  of  Helen  Hayes'  face  is  something  to  remember.  A  shine  pro-  duced by  too  much  oil  or  that  dry,  soap-and-  water  look,  is  certainly  not  to  be  desired.  But  there  is  another  way  that  Lupe  Velez  told  me  about  in  Hollywood  last  year.  It  is  achieved  by  following  your  usual  make-up  procedure,  then  gently  rubbing  the  full  part  of  the  cheeks  so  that  the  natural  sheen  of  the  skin  seems  to  come  through  the  make-up.  The  effect  on  a  young  face  is  beautiful,  subtle,  mystifying.   T  ORETTA  YOUXG  says  that  if  you  are  in-  *— 'clined  to  be  pale,  a  little  rouge  on  the  cheeks  will  lift  your  spirits  no  end.  Some  pale  skins  are  beautiful,  but  the  girl  who  is  naturally  pale  and  feels  pale,  will  do  herself  a  big  kindness  by  using  a  little  rouge.  It  changes  your  whole  viewpoint,  thinks  Loretta.  Even  movie  make-  up now  permits  rouge  and  this  delights  Loretta.  It  makes  her  give  a  much  better  performance.  She  is  naturally  pale,  but  her  skin  is  so  satin-  smooth,  her  eyes  so  colorful,  her  mouth  so  full,  that  she  hardly  needs  cheek  color.  However,  it  makes  her  feel  better — so  there.   FAY  WRAY  has  a  pet  cure-all  for  tired  eyes.  She  fills  small  bags  with  dried  rose  leaves  and  camomile  flowers,  clips  them  in  hot  water,  applies  to  closed  eyes.   This  rests  nerves  also.

IF  THERE'S  one  place  in  the  world  where  excess  weight  isn't  wanted  — it's  in  the  movies!   A  few  extra  pounds  can  cost  a  star  a  contract.  Keeping  slender  in  Holly-  wood isn't  a  hobby — it's  a  require-  ment for  success.   That's  why  every  movie  star  is  an  amateur  dietician.  Knows  exactly  what  foods  will  yield  the  nourish-  ment and  energy  every  star  must  have  — yet  not  add  a  jot  to  the  waistline.   Heavy  lunches — taboo!   At  lunch  time,  for  example,  you'll  find  few  stars  eating  heavy,fattening  lunches.  They  need  energy — plenty  of  it  —  to  carry  them  through  the  grind  of  the  afternoon.  But  they  get  it   in    a    nourishing,    non-fattening    lunch.  A  lunch  that's  become  famous  on  the  lots  as  the  "Hollywood  lunch."  If  you  had  dropped  in  at  the  R-K-O-  Radio  Studios  around  noontime,  when  Fay  Wray  and  Bruce  Cabot  were  making  "King  Kong"  —  the  chances  are  you  would  have  seen  them  enjoying  it  —  a  sandwich  and  a  glass  of  malted  milk!   Get  the  "Hollywood  lunch"  habit   If  you  want  to  stay  slim,  take  a  tip  from  the  movies  and  pass  up  the    heavy  lunches.  Instead,  order  a  sand-  wich and  the  grandest,  creamiest  malted  milk  you  ever  drank  —  Borden's  Malted  Milk.   Why  Borden's  is  better   Borden's  is  a  richer  malted  milk.  Richer  in  energy-building  nourish-  ment. Richer  in  Vitamins  A,  B  and  G.

And  Gloria  had  more  or  less  to  climb  out  of  the  driver's  seat  and  hand  the  buggy  whip  to  Pola?  "Never,"  announced  Gloria,  "will  I  step  foot  on  this  lot  as  long  as  that  woman  remains."  And  in  order  to  make  good  her  threat  she  got  herself  a  wheel  chair  and  went  Palm  Beach  chair-riding  from  dress-  ing-room to  set.  Can  or  can't  you  see  the  elegant  Miss  Swanson  chair-riding  past  the  Negri  dressing-room  with  nose  elevated  forty-  five  degrees  in  the  ozone?  Home,  James!   A  ND  then,  heaven  help  everybody,  Gloria  •**-discovered  Pola  loathed  cats.  That  was  enough.  From  that  moment  on,  Gloria  be-  came a  first  class  cat  fancier  with  kittens  be-  getting kittens  until — well,  really  you  actually  had  to  wade  knee  deep  in  kittens  on  the  Para-  mount lot.  They  even  gave  directions  by  the  cats.  Three  gray  cats  and  one  Tom  to  the  left.  The)'  actually — now  mind,  this  in  the  twentieth  century — hired  a  man  and  paid  him  a  good  salary  to  keep  the  eats  off  Pola's  doorstep.   Doorstep-chaser-off-of-cats,  they  listed  him  on  the  payroll,  I  believe.   Then  there's  the  case  of  Charles  Laughton,  English  actor,  and  Richard  Arlen.    There  was    something  about  the  big  Englishman  that  rubbed  Dick  the  wrong  way  somehow.  There  was  no  doubt,  Arlen  didn't  jibe  with  Laughton.   I"  AUGHTON  would  rehearse  his  lines,  pacing  -Ljup  and  down,  up  and  down,  with  Dick  right  behind  him  giving  the  best  imitation  of  a  huge  and  serious  Englishman  ever  given.   It  irked  Laughton  no  end.  He  kept  flinging  Dick  the  dirtiest  of  glances.  Then  Dick,  in  order  to  taunt  Laughton  further,  decided  to  call  him  "Buster."  " Buster,"  mind  you,  for  a  large  and  dignified  Englishman.   But  imagine  Arlen's  surprise  when  Laughton  thought  the  "  Buster"  idea  the  funniest  thing  he'd  ever  heard.  "Buster,"  he  kept  saying.  "  Funny,  eh  what?  "  And  then  Dick  shortened  it  to  "  Buzzy"  and  that  did  the  trick.  The  two  became  inseparable  companions.  Wherever  Dick  went — Palm  Springs,  Arrowhead  or  Agua  Caliente — there  also  went  "Buzzy."   Why  you  can  believe  it  or  not,  but  they  took  Nero,  the  star  lion  of  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross"  over  to  see  Leo,  mascot  of  M-G-M,  and  Leo  walked  over,  took  one  sniff  at  the  Paramount  star,  ups  with  his  tail  and  smacked  Nero  a  clout  over  the  jaw  that  left  him  prostrate  for  an  hour.   And  that,  boys  and  girls,  is  what  a  feud  means  in  Hollywood.    Mary  Returns  to  Herself    CONTINUED  FROM  PACE  62    This  is  brought  about,  Mary  made  plain,  largely  because  of  the  lack  of  good  film  stories.  For  the  independent  star  who  seeks  quality,  as  Mary  Pickford  must,  the  matter  of  securing  the  right  sort  of  screen  material  is  most  vital.   BECAUSE  it  is  so  difficult  to  find  a  good  story,"  she  said,  "I  have  been  accused  of  being  unable  to  make  up  my  mind.  This  was  especially  so  before  I  began  'Secrets.'  The  truth  is,  however,  that  the  opposite  is  the  case.  Long  ago  I  made  up  my  mind  that  I  would  not  go  into  production  until  I  was  sure  I  had  a  suitable  vehicle.  And  standing  pat  on  that  determination  took  fortitude,  for  you  have  no  idea  how  often  I  had  to  say  to  tempting  authors,  'Get  thy  typewriters  behind  me.'   "And  as  they  withdrew  into  the  folds  of  their  manuscripts,  I  continued  the  search,  high  and  low,  until  right  underfoot,  I  discovered  the  very  thing  I  sought — 'Secrets'!  It  had  so  much  more  body,  so  much  more  rhythm,  so  much  more  romance  and  beauty  and  quality  that  we  realized  fully  we  would  be  wasting  time  to  look  further. "   As  Mary  talked  on,  Borzage  paced  back  and  forth.  From  the  gloom  beyond  the  lights  he  could  hear  Old  Man  .Budget  croaking  his  sad  refrain,  "Overhead,  overhead!"   "Good  gracious!"  exclaimed  Mary,  "I'm  holding  up  the  company!"   She  sprang  into  the  waiting  car  with  Leslie  Howard  and  immediately  they  became  Mr.  and  Mrs.  John  Carlton  of  "Secrets,"  setting  out  valiantly  across  the  continent  for  the  final  fade-  out  of  the  film.  My  thought  flashed  back  to  what  Mary  had  said  earlier  in  the  interview:   "The  career  of  a  film  star  can  be  likened  to  a  pathway  made  of  uneven  stepping-stones.  Some  are  round,  others  square,  one  will  be  high,  another  low,  yet  they  all  lead  in  the  general  direction  of  an  ultimate  goal.  So  it  is  with  the  pictures  upon  which  a  screen  celebrity  builds  her  career.  The  bad  pictures  (and  all  stars  make   them  occasionally,  she  maintains)   are    the  stones  with  round  faces  that  make  you  slip  when  you  step  on  them.  But  you  don't  stop  there,  you  keep  going,  and  your  next  stepping-stone  is  broad  and  flat  and  smooth,  perhaps  the  finest  in  all  the  walk. "   The  star  who  steps  on  a  slippery  stone  and  stops,  hesitates  on  the  abyss  of  oblivion,  Mary  thinks.  There  have  been  fewer  slippery  stones  in  her  pathway  than  in  the  pathway  of  many  other  stars  for  the  reason  that  as  an  independ-  ent producer  she  has  been  able  to  select  her  plays.  Other  stars,  with  contractual  obliga-  tions to  fulfill,  could  not  do  this.   "In  other  words,"  she  stated,  "I'm  my  own  boss.    If  I  don't  like  a  story,  I  don't  make  it.  "   And  this  privilege  wisely  applied  has  un-  doubtedly added  to  the  long  continuation  of  her  career.   "Mary's  most  successful  film,  both  finan-  cially and  artistically,"  an  official  of  the  Pro-  ducers' Association  said,  "was  'Coquette.'  It  won  the  Academy's  award  of  merit,  and  made  for  Mary  $300,000  more  than  any  other  pic-  ture she  ever  produced.   "At  the  time  of  its  release,  three  thousand  theaters  could  not  show  it  because  they  were  not  equipped  for  sound."   SO  with  three  thousand  less  theaters  showing  it  than  had  ever  before  played  a  Pickford  production,  'Coquette'  made  $300,000  more —  a  record  which  may  never  be  equaled.  In  one  theater  alone,"  Old  Man  Budget  bragged,  (the  United  Artists  in  Los  Angeles),  "a  total  of  297,000  patrons  saw  'Coquette,'  38,500  of  them  seeing  it  in  a  single  week — a  record  which  still  stands. "   When  asked  about  "Secrets"  Mary  said,  "When  I  finish  apicture,  I  am  always  reluctant  to  talk  about  it.  I  can  say  this,  however,  about  'Secrets':  There  is  not  one  place  in  it  where  I  feel  embarrassed.  It  is  the  first  picture  I  ever  made  to  which  I  have  had  that  reaction.  Not  once  do  I  want  to  hang  my  head.  I  have  great  faith  in  'Secrets.'  "    Photoplay  Magazine  for  March,  1933    IOI    Two's  a  Crowd    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  34  ]   she  might  have  become  just  another  sister  of  the  famous  who  simply  disappeared.  If  she  had  made  a  triumphal  entry  behind  a  police  escort  in  her  Igotta-Cheesini,  and  had  taken  up  her  residence  a  la  figidairc  in  a  marble-  trimmed  mansion — but  she  didn't.  Twenty-  year-old  Joan  was  already  far  too  wise  to  make  such  mistakes  or  allow  them  to  be  made  for  her.   Instead,  Joan  came  to  Hollywood  as  a  little  brown  mouse,  trying  at  first  to  gnaw  only  a  little  hole.   At  first,  scarcely  anybody  knew  she  was  in  town  at  all.  She  took  a  modest  little  apart-  ment, with  only  a  nurse  for  the  now  five-year-  old  Diana,  nee  Adrienne  (and  a  cute  little  trick  she  is,  too).  She  drove  around  town  in  a  little  Ford  car — to  the  eminent  peril  of  the  populace,  because  Joan  is  very  near-sighted.  Figuratively  speaking,  Connie  glided  over  the  boulevards  in  her  chauffeur-driven  limousine  while  Joan  rattled  and  squeaked  down  the  side  streets;  and  that  isn't  nearly  as  figurative  as  it  sounds,  either.   ANYWAY,  Joan's  modus  operandi  was  as  different  from  Connie's  as  chalk  from  cheese.  Their  personalities  are  as  far  apart  as  the  poles,  anyway.  Connie's  difference  from  Joan  is  theatrical,  strident;  Joan's  difference  from  Connie  is  quiet,  subtle.  Connie  is  a  beautiful  princess  of  the  stage,  while  Joan  is  a  princess  of   the   blood.   You  know  how  it  is  on  the  screen — Connie  may  start  out  humbly,  but  she  always  winds  up  as  the  beautiful,  sophisticated  lady,  her  lovely  blonde  head  emerging  from  a  soiree  of  gorgeous  clothes,  just  like  Gloria  Swanson  did  years  ago.  In  Joan's  latest  picture,  "Me  and  My  Gal,"  she  is  a  waitress  whose  ultimate  achievement  is  to  marry  a  cop.   The  same  contrast  holds  pretty  true  off  screen,  too.  Of  course,  Gene  Markey,  Joan's  present  husband — and  a  charming  fellow  in-  deed— is  a  long  way  removed  from  being  a  cop.  But  he  is  merely  an  American,  while  Connie  could  get  along  with  nothing  less  than  a  marquis.   She  still  drives  the  little  car  herself,  though  not  quite  so  perilously  to  the  population  as  before,  because  she  wears  glasses  now  and  drives  more  slowly.  But  can  you  imagine  a  movie  celebrity  having  a  three-year-old  Ford  repainted  instead  of  buying  a  new  one?  Joan  just  did.  The  paint  job  cost  her  exactly  twenty-five  dollars.   "It's  good  for  three  more  years  now,"  she  says.   After  her  first  picture  she  moved  into  a  little  house,  but  it  is  characteristic  of  Joan  that  the  house  cost  even  less  than  the  apart-  ment. Now  she  lives  in  a  big  house  in  Beverly  Hills,  quite  in  keeping  with  her  position.  But  the  catch  is  that  she  rents  the  house  instead  of  owning  it,  and  the  rent  she  pays  is  actually  less  than  the  taxes  and  interest  would  be  if  she  had  to  pay  them.  You  can  get  a  lot  for  a  little  just  now,  if  you  happen  to  know  how —  and  Joan  does  know  how.   CONNIE  has  just  had  the  resplendent  edifice  which  she  owns  and  inhabits  completely  redecorated  and  refurnished.  You  can  imagine  what  that  cost  Connie — in  addition  to  the  original  item  of  buying  and  constant  item  of  upkeeping  the  house.   Joan  is  still  using  the  same  furniture  she  had  when  she  was  married  to  her  first  husband.  She  has  had  it  ever  since  she  was  sixteen.

Joan  entertains  her  friends  only,  and  gives  no  big  parties  at  all.   What  do  you  think  Joan  did  while  she  was  living  at  the  beach  last  summer?   The  store  at  Malibu  struck  Joan  as  pretty  expensive  and  so,  three  times  a  week  all  the  time  she  was  there,  in  the  Ford  and  with  her  market-basket  on  her  arm,  she  came  in  to  the  Hollywood  markets  and  went  shopping.  She  isn't  a  tightwad  in  any  sense,  but  she  does  take  pride  in  buying  what  she  wants  with  as  big  a  saving  as  she  can.   "It's  only  sensible,"  she  says.  "I  like  to  give  money  away  where  it  will  help  someone    who  really  needs  it.'  but  I  hate  to  throw  it  away  where  it  doesn't  do  any  good."   What  intelligent  person  will  gainsay  her?  Hasn't  even  Mr.  Rockefeller  cut  down  on  his  dimes?   Joan's  steady  climb,  her  intelligence  in  not  trying  to  outshine,  not  trying  to  capitalize  on  or  compete  with  sister  Connie,  has  broken  down  an  almost  insurmountable  barrier,  has  swept  aside  an  almost  unscalable  obstacle  and  has  accomplished  almost  equally — some  will  say  at  least  equally — resplendent  re-  sults. She  has  won  through,  unaided,  to  the  top.  Her  place  even  now  is  scarcely  less  elevated  in  cinema  strata  than  Connie's,  and  she  is  still  climbing  in  exactly  the  same  way.   Ayf ANY  in  Hollywood  and  elsewhere  feel  ■I  "-that  Connie  has  reached  her  peak.  Joan's  work  has  noticeably  improved  with  her  every  performance.

Again,  he  may  be  the  impish  prankster,  the  practical  jokester;  the  quick-thinking,  smooth-  talking  young  fellow  like  Lee  Tracy  in  "  Blessed  Event"  or  "The  Half-Naked  Truth."  And  like  Lee  Tracy,  he  puts  his  "smart-alec"  tricks  to  good,  money-making,  high-pressure  use.  Sometimes  pulling  his  sweetheart's  hair  or  breaking  her  doll  or  her  heart  (temporarily)  by  so  doing.   But  acting  very  rough  and  "  the  devil-take-  it"  about  his  own  emotions.     Yet,  with  all    his  misdemeanors  he  just  takes  hold  of  his  lady's  heart-strings  and  hangs  on — for-  ever!   Another  variation  of  this  type  of  "little  boy"  is  the  one  who's  always  getting  into  trouble.  Not  being  strong  enough  to  stop  drinking  or  gambling.   Allowing  himself  to  become  enmeshed,  or  even  burned,  by  Theda-Barish,  Myrna  Loy-  ish  sirens.   But  after  a  series  of  escapades,  he  always  comes  home  and  hides  his  head  in  some  ma-  donna's lap  (of  course,  she's  been  waiting  for  him  these  many  months),  knowing  full  well    "Gee,  it's  good  to  be  home  again!"  were  probably  Doug's  first  words  after  the  excitement  of  seeing  Mary  and  Doug,  Jr.,  had  subsided.

Isn't  he  often  the  idol  of  that  woman  who,  in  real  life,  has  known  the  more  direct,  brusque,  primitively  virile  man?   For  it's  true  that  what  we  miss  in  actuality,  we  long  for  in  our  own  private  little  dream  world.   Which,  in  the  language  of  Dr.  Watson  and  the  psychologists,  is  known  as  the  Compensa-  tion Motive — or  Solace  for  Frustration.   Doesn't  it  seem  plausible,  then,  that  even  a  very  strong,  physical  type  of  woman,  full  of  healthy  energy  and  vitality,  who.  in  her  every-  day life,  attracts  the  Clark  Gable  pattern  of  man — has.  perhaps,  even  married  om — might  secretly  long  to  he  wooed  by  a  more  intuitive,  poetic,  less  vigorous  lover?   The  original  authentic  design  for  whom  is.  to  our  minds,  the  charming  Leslie  Howard!  So  cultivated,  so  polished,  so  gay,  and  yet  so  wistfully  tender!   What  an  appeal  Leslie  must  make  to  tin-  woman  who  longs  for  romance  on  a  higher,  more  spiritual  plane!   To  her  who  shuns  a  too-harsh  contact  with  lift — who  shrinks  from  a  torrid  passion — who  dreams  of  a  poetic  love  and  a  "moonlight  and  roses''  lover!   Did  you  see  him  in  that  British  film,  "Re-  served for  Ladies  "?  Or  in  "  Smilin'  Through.  "  with  its  delicately  drawn  sentiment,  as  fragile  as  some  old  tapestry?  Or  again  in  "The  Animal  Kingdom,"  where — although  his  ideals  are  shaken  by  a  mercenary  wife  who  turns  out  to  have  Delilah  instincts  and  the  tactics  of  a  gold  digging  mistress — he  retains  ever  that  gra-  cious, dignified  and  wistful  lover  quality.   I'm  positively  raving.  Well,  if  this  is  a  roof-  ton  confession,  I  don't  care  who  hears  it!   It's  likely  too,  that  you  could  conceive  of  a  rioely  mature  woman  to  whom  life  is  fairly  much  a  round  of  keeping  the  coffee  piping  hut  for  husband  Willie  and  forcing  the  springtime  sulphur  and  molasses  on  little  Willie — secretly  nursing  a  yen  for  Ramon  Xovarro.   OH,  she'd  be  quite  indignant  if  you  accused  her  of  it.   But  we'd  wager  that  when  she  saw  him  in,  say,  ''  Son  of  India,  "  there  might  have  been  just  a  tiny  choking  sensation  in  her  throat  when  he  Had  to  relinquish  the  girl  he  loved.  Yes.  it's  been  known  to  happen,  even  to  the  substan-  tial lady  who  "doesn't  believe  in  that  sort  of  nonsense!"   Because  our  subconscious  pliys  all  sorts  of  funny  tricks  on  us.    Yea.  verily!   And,  finally,  if  there's  any  truth  in  these  theories,  we  wonder  if,  in  discovering  your  dominant  screen  lover  type,  you've  also  ar-  rived at  some  interesting  or  startling  conclu-  sions about  yourself.

Then  we  always  catch  the  boat  home,  just  as  scheduled."   "  "LJTAVEN'T  you  ever  gone  too  far  with  one  •*-  -*-of  these  spells?"  I  asked.   "Oh  yes,  I  broke  down  and  bought  a  house  out  in  New  Canaan,  Connecticut.  Perfectly  Early  American,  with  three  Dutch  ovens.  I  wanted  it,  gosh,  how  I  wanted  that  house.   "And  was  that  the  test  of  the  true  woman  and  wife!   "Alma  didn't  once  remind  me  of  how  imprac-  tical it  was,  how  far  away,  or  anything.  If  she  had  been  an  actress,  her  first  thought  would  have  been, '  How  will  I  get  to  the  theater? '  You  see,  I  explained  airily  that  /  would  commute.  It's  only  a  few  hours  from  New  York."   "Is  he  really  as  nutty  as  he  sounds?"  I  ap-  pealed to  Alma.   "Oh,  much  more  so,"  she  assured  me,  proudly.  "  He's  a  life  work  for  any  one  woman  — and  I  thrive  on  being  the  one  woman."   Frank  told  me  how  their  Eastern  friends  gave  them  three  months — possibly  six — to  stay  together  after  they  came  to  Hollywood.   Dire  predictions  were  murmured  about  Hollywood  blondes,  about  Hollywood  di-  vorces.   "If  Alma  were  a  picture  actress,  maybe  I'd  be  alarmed,"  Frank  said.  "There  are  lots  of  handsome  actors  out  here.    Faking  my  life  in    my  hands,  I  make  the  bold  assertion  that  there  are  more  good-looking  men  than  women!   "You  see,  I've  been  in  two  Ziegfeld  shows,  and  done  a  bit  of  traveling  hither  and  yon,  so  perhaps  I'm  immune  to  Hollywood  blondes.  We've  managed  to  weather  nineteen  years,  so  I  guess  things  will  go  on  the  same  as  usual  in  Hollywood."   Alma  added  that  being  slightly  nutty  helped.  They  found  their  own  company  awfully  good  entertainment.   "And  what  are  you  two  being  crazy  about  at  the  present  time?"  I  wanted  to  know.   "George!"  They  agreed  simultaneously.  "And  dachshunds!"   George,  it  turns  out,  is  a  seventeen-year-old  son.  And  George  is  no  ordinary  run  of  child.  George  is  about  the  most  completely  extraor-  dinary and  satisfactory  son  two  people  ever  had.  (George  occupied  the  next  two  hours,  with  never  a  dull  moment.)  He  is  studying  in  an  Eastern  school  to  be  a  diplomat  or  an  archaeologist,  they  don't  know  which  it  is  this  week.   AS  a  parting  shot,  I  asked  Frank,  "Don't  ■*  *-you  think  this  marriage  might  have  been  a  success,  even  if  Alma  were  an  actress?"   "I'm  not  so  sure  she  isn't,  sometimes — just  as  all  good  wives  are."  Frank  grinned  and  shifted  into  high  with  the  other  eyebrow.

Eddie  still  wants  to  know.  And  he  believes  that  the  answer  would  eliminate  a  lot  of  grief  in  American  homes.   When  Eddie  and  Lilyan  were  first  married  I  hey  made  an  agreement.  It  was  Lilyan's  house  which  they  intended  to — and  do — live  in;  Eddie  pays  all  the  household  expenses  and  domestic  bills.  Lilyan  pays  for  her  own  clothes.   She  is  known  as  the  best-dressed  woman  in  Hollywood,  and  she  has  often  said  that  she  would  never  expect  any  man  to  pay  for  the  enormous  wardrobe  she  keeps  constantly  up-  to-the-minute.   She  spends  several  thousands  of  dollars  a  year  for  her  hats  alone.  ( Incidentally,  the  only  thing  which  she  and  Eddie  ever  row  about  is  a  little  black  beret  which  she  bought  in  Germany  and  which  they  both  like  to  wear.)  It  is  a  part  of  her  profession  to  be  strikingly  dressed,  and  the  expenditure  comes  under  necessary  profes-  sional expenses.   Hut  imagine  a  non-professional  husband  being  able  to  understand  that!   HPHEY  both  make  large  salaries,  and  it  would  ■*■  be  a  very  optimistic  wolf  indeed  who  hung  around  the  Lowe-Tashman  door.  Both  are  financially  independent  of  each  other.  Neither  has  to  remain  with  the  other  for  economic  reasons;  the  only  reason  they  stay  married  is  because  they  want  to.   "Imagine  the  compliment  that  is  paid  a  man,"  Eddie  remarks,  "when  he  feels  that  his  wife  is  there  only  because  she  prefers  to  be.  He  knows  that  she  lives  with  him  because  she  loves  him — not  because  she's  got  to  stay  to  be  sure  of  a  living."   And  so  far  as  that  is  concerned,  too,  Eddie  has  a  thing  or  two  apropos.   "Every  woman  would  feel  better,  I  think,    and  her  life  would  be  happier,"  he  went  on,  "if  she  were  able  to  make  her  own  living — if  her  own  efforts  made  her  independent,  i  know  that  this,  in  a  large  number  of  cases,  is  impractical,  especially  in  these  days.  But  the  idea  is  that  some  women  seem  to  like  to  be  clinging  vines,  virtually  asking  their  husbands  for  handouts.  Such  a  woman  could  never  make  an  ideal  wife  for  an  actor.   "It  isn't  the  money  so  much,  but  an  actor  feels  that  just  as  he  must  have  a  competent  person  playing  opposite  him  in  his  pictures,  so  he  must  have  a  wife  who  is  competent  to  play  opposite  him  in  real  life."   XTEITHER  Eddie  nor  Lilyan  stop  acting  •*-^when  they  leave  the  set.  No  genuine  trouper  ever  does.  They  act  in  private  just  as  they  act  in  public — if  they  didn't  they  wouldn't  be  themselves.  But  no  non-professional,  Eddie  thinks,  would  ever  understand  that  this  acting  at  home  is  really  the  genuine  thing.   True  happiness  in  marriage,  declares  Eddie,  lies  not  in  a  diversity  of  interests  in  the  home,  but  in  a  consolidation  of  them.   And  in  Eddie's  opinion,  a  non-professional  has  about  as  much  chance  of  sharing  a  profes-  sional career  as  the  haystack  has  of  finding  the  proverbial  needle.   "Then  there  are  the  little  things,"  he  finished,  "all  the  little  things  that  are  really  the  big  things  of  a  motion  picture  player's  life.  How  could  a  non-professional  wife  ever  hope  to  understand  an  actor's  peculiar  twists  and  turns,  so  to  speak,  the  peculiarities  that  go  to  make  up  his  personality?  His  pet  little  superstitions,  for  instance,  and  his  generally  screwy  way  of  doing  things?  No,  I  tell  you  that  I  don't  be-  lieve it  would  work— I'm  sure  it  wouldn't  with  me.  The  only  possible  way  an  actor  can  get  full  understanding  in  a  wife  is  to  marry  an  actress."   And  thus,  dear  people,  Sergeant  Quirt  Lowe  sez  his  say.

[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  72  ]    next  twelve  years  Dorothy  attended  the  Zionist  schools,  lived  the  Zionist  routine  and  knew  only  the  Zionist  creed.  But  inwardly  her  soul  rebelled.  One  night,  while  she  and  three  other  girls  were  playing  hookey  from  a  prayer-meeting  in  favor  of  a  sinful  sleigh-ride,  they  stopped  at  a  movie  show.  That  was  at  Waukegan,  six  miles  from  Zion.   "Let's  go  in,"  one  of  them  suggested  with  bated  breath,  and  then  almost  froze  with  the  audacity  of  her  own  suggestion.   But  they  did  go  in.  They  sat  as  still  as  they  did  in  church,  and  stared  at  the  screen  with  open  mouths.  Before  their  eyes  a  handsome  man  and  a  beautiful  woman  made  love !  Love !  This  was  the  first  movie  they  had  ever  seen —  this  was  life !   So  fascinated  was  Dorothy  by  what  she  saw,  so  completely  hypnotized  by  the  beauty  and  glamour  of  it,  that  she  determined,  right  then  and  there,  to  be  an  actress.   But  it  wasn't  so  easy  as  all  that.  The  four  returned  to  Zion  in  an  ecstasy  of  delight —  only  to  find  that  somebody  had  seen  them  enter  the  show  and  "peached"  to  the  overseer.  Dorothy  and  the  others  were  called  before  Voliva  and  stood  shaking  in  their  shoes  while  he  told  them  that  Satan  was  laying  siege  to  their  souls.   TTHAT  wasn't  all,  either.  They  couldn't  go  ■*-  to  school  or  to  church  for  a  certain  specified  time  because  their  worldliness  might  con-  taminate the  others.  They  managed  to  bear  up  under  that  part  of  the  punishment,  all  right — but  what  Voliva  instructed  their  parents  to  add  to  it  in  the  woodshed  was  a  bit  more  difficult.   At  the  first  opportunity  Dorothy  left  Zion  fiat  and  went  to  Chicago.  She  got  a  job  with  a  Chautauqua  company  playing  the  tank  towns,  and  when  that  stranded,  she  somehow  made  her  way  to  New  York.  There,  she  eventually  became  a  leading  woman  on  the  legitimate  stage.   A  film  test  brought  her  to  Hollywood,  and  she's  been  there  ever  since.   But  there  will  never  be  any  pieces  in  the  Zionist  paper  about  the  home-town  girl  who  made  good,  nor  will  those  who  knew  her  as  a  youngster  ever  go  to  see  her  on  the  screen.

[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  37    reasoned  that  Peck's  likeness  to  Farrell — the  two  arc  similar  in  appearance,  except  that  Lydell  is  perhaps  more  rugged — accounted  for  her  interest  in  the  young  attorney.   Hollywood  became  practically  apoplectic  when  Farrell  turned  to  Miss  Valli.  Hollywood  looked  on,  glassy-eyed, when  Janet  lunched  at  the  Brown  Derby  with  Lydell,  and  Charlie  dined  Virginia  at  the  Montmarte.   If  Miss  Gaynor  and  Peck  were  seen  dancing  together  at  the  Cocoanut  Grove,  so  were  Miss  ^Valli  and  Farrell  spied  at  the  Biltmore  Gardens.   The  four-sided  wooing  became  a  game  of  chess,  with  Hollywood  watching  every  move  breathlessly.  Janet  and  Charlie.  Janet  and  Lydell.     Charlie  and  Virginia.   Then,  overnight,  Pick  left  Hollywood!   Nor  could  Hollywood  understand  his  sudden  departure.  So  Hollywood  decided  that  Janet  had  sent  Peck  away.    Most  tooth  troubles  start  in  film    WHAT  is  this  film  that  robs  us  of  our  teeth?  A  slippery,  sticky  coating  formed  by  the  mucin  in  saliva.  It  stains  teeth  yel-  low. It  catches  bits  of  food  which  soon  decay.  Yes,  but  that's  not  all!  Film  contains  mil-  lions of  tiny  germs.   Some  are  rod-shaped, grouped  in  clusters.  These  are  decay  germs.  As  they  live  they  give  off  enzymes  that  produce  lactic  acid.  This  lactic  acid  dissolves  tooth  enamel  just  as  other  acids  eat  holes  in  cloth.  Other  germs  are  linked  with  "trench  mouth"—  still  others  with  pyorrhea.   "What  must  I  do  to  fight  film?"   To  fight  film  use  Pepsodent  instead  of  ordi-  nary tooth  pastes.  Why?  Because  a  tooth  paste  is  only  as  good  as  its  polishing  mate-  rial; not  one  bit  better.  The  new  polish-  ing material  in  Pepsodent  is  one  of  the  great  discoveries  of  the  day.  Its  power  to  remove  every  trace  of  film  stain  is  revolu-  tionary! Its  notable  distinction  of  being  twice  as  soft  as  polishing  materials  in  com-  mon use  has  gained  wide  recognition.  Remember,  the  one  safe  way  to  fight  film  is  to  use  the  special  film-removing  tooth  paste— Pepsodent— twice  every  day  and  to  see  your  dentist  at  least  twice  a  year.

Until  it  heard  that  he  had  invited  Miss  Valli  and  other  guests  for  a  sail  on  his  boat.   And  then  by  coincidence,  the  following  day  Peck  arrived  from  San  Francisco.   For  the  next  week,  Hollywood  passed  into  a  stage  of  near-lunacy  when  so  many  exciting  events  happened.  Janet  and  Lydell  applied  for  a  marriage  license  and  set  the  wedding  date  for  five  days  later.   Then  Lydell  returned  to  San  Francisco  to  arrange  for  the  ceremony  and  a  honeymoon  in  Honolulu.   The  marriage  took  place  in  San  Francisco,  after  which  the  newlyweds  sailed  for  Honolulu.   Not  so  many  months  after  Janet's  return  to  Hollywood  with  her  new  husband,  Charlie  de-  cided to  go  to  Europe.  He  bought  two  tickets;  one  was  for  Carlton  Hoechstra,  his  financial  secretary.    The  two  men  sped  for  the  East  Coast,  in-  tending to  board  a  ship  out  of  New  York  harbor  without  delay.   But  when  they  arrived  in  New  York,  Miss  Valli  was  there,  visiting  her  friend  Colleen  Moore.   Charlie  and  Virginia  saw  each  other  many  times;  in  fact,  he  missed  three  boats.  Then  he  and  Virginia  eloped  and  were  married  and  sailed  for  Europe  on  their  honeymoon.   Hoechstra,  Charlie's  secretary,  returned  to  Hollywood,  somewhat  chagrined.  The  new  Mrs.  Farrell  had  traveled  on  the  ticket  origi-  nally purchased  for  his  use.   *V\  Then  Virginia  and  Charlie  returned  to  **  Hollywood,  they  and  Janet  and  Lydell  became  the  most  noted  foursome  in  the  city.

It  reminds  one  of  the  very  proper  little  girl  who  strolled  into  the  parlor  while  her  mother  was  entertaining  a  very  proper  neighbor  and  when  mother  asked  her  small  daughter  what  she'd  like  to  play,  the  child  replied:  "I  wanna  jump  in  the  mud  puddles  and  get  all  dirty."   BEING  garbed  in  white  constantly  becomes  irksome.  A  touch  of  scarlet  lends  interest.  Dramatically  speaking,  it  is  the  piquant  sauce  which  Ruth  Chatterton  has  added  to  a  career  of  sober  pictures.  And  Ruth,  said  to  have  last  word  of  authority  on  stories,  photography  and  publicity,  may  be  secretly  enjoying  the  shock  she  handed  her  public  in  those  sensational  posters  on  "Frisco  Jenny."   Yet  her  Hollywood  friends,  those  who  have  the  interest  of  her  career  sincerely  at  heart,  are  frankly  worried  about  this  change.   Fundamentally,  Ruth  is  a  lady.  Her  features  have  a  delicate  loveliness.  There  is  about  her  an  air  of  gentle  distinction,  of  cool  lucidity,  the  result  of  good  breeding.  Her  personal  taste  in  clothes  is  faultless.  To  her  is  left  very  often  the  selecting  of  her  screen  ward-  robe, for  she  has  a  discerning  eye  born  to  innate  good  taste.   She  was  reared  in  an  atmosphere  of  disci-  pline, supported  by  respectability,  which  accounts  for  a  certain  preciosity  of  manner.  If  she  sat  cross-legged  on  the  floor,  smoking  a  cigarette  and  chewing  gum,  as  she  has  done  sometimes,  she  is  still  Chatterton — the  gentlewoman.   And  that  is  why  some  of  her  friends  believe  Ruth's  flair  for  the  new  type  of  role  will  not  last.     The  public  will  see  through  the  make-    believe  and  they  will  be  looking  right  straight  at  the  lady  who  is  known  as  Ruth  Chatterton,  now  poorly  disguised.   Yet  wasn't  it  "Madame  X"  that  put  Ruth  across  in  pictures?  And  surely  Madame  X  was  no  Park  Avenue  matron.  Chatterton  enjoyed  doing  that  picture.   Incidentally,  it  was  a  great  surprise  to  the  studio  when  it  went  over  with  such  tremen-  dous success.   Then  followed  some  of  her  ladylike  roles.  Remember  how  aristocratically  she  took  those  blows  from  life  in  "The  Doctor's  Secret"?   And  she  knew  her  society  set  when  she  played  in  "A  Lady  of  Scandal."   Ruth  became  raucous  once  again  in  "Any-  body's Woman,"  and  it  was  conceded  to  be  one  of  the  best  pictures  she  ever  did.  Re-  member how  she  sat  in  her  undies,  strumming  a  uke  in  a  cheap  hotel  room — a  show  girl,  broke  and  out  of  a  job?  It  was  the  first  time  Chatterton  had  ever  changed  her  appearance,  too.  Gone  were  her  soft  brown  locks,  and  instead  she  was  a  hard-hearted  platinum  blondie  not  at  all  remiss  to  a  flirtation  across  the  areaway  with  the  handsome  scion,  Clive  Brook.   STRANGE  how  one  remembers  this  and  yet  the  picture  in  which  she  played  a  farmer's  wife  and  wore  a  black  wig  is  dimmed.  Maybe  it  is  as  Chatterton  claims,  "Nothing  dramatic  ever  happens  to  a  good  woman."   The  future  of  Chatterton's  career  is  hanging  in  the  balance.  Is  she  to  be  a  rowdy  or  a  lady?  Maybe  the  fates  will  be  kind  and  dish  up  a  little  of  each,  in  proper  proportion,  so  that  Chatterton's  divided  public  may  all  be  pleased.

Wally  learned  other  things  from  the  ele-  phants, too.  It  was  always  easier  for  him  to  handle  them  as  a  group.  To  train  one  ele-  phant was  almost  impossible.    To  train  several  at  a  time  was  comparatively  easy.  If  one  of  his  charges  saw  another  suc-  ceeding at  a  trick,  he  seemed  especially  anxious  to  succeed  also.   If  he  saw  another  plodding  ahead  with  his  duties,  he  seemed  actually  ashamed  to  fall  down  on  his  part  of  the  job.   Thus,  elephants  are  seldom  trained  singly.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  March,  1933    107    There  is  too  much  opportunity  for  individual  display  of  laziness,  temper,  or  indifference.   That  goes  for  humans,  too.   Today,  Wally  believes  in  the  public  school  system.   He  does  not  plan  to  have  a  private  tutor  for  his  adopted  daughter,  Carol  Ann,  or  her  broth-  ers, George  and  William,  whom  he  and  Mrs.  lieery  will  rear.   "It's  easier  to  learn  when  you  are  one  of  a  number,"  he  says.   "There's  a  competitive  spirit.  It's  easier.  too,  to  teach  when  there  is  an  audience  of  man)-  rather  than  one.   "Children,  like  elephants,  are  quick,  to  imi-  tate.   "They  are  naturally  gregarious,  and  a  suc-  cessful example  is  one  of  the  surest  ways  to  teach  them."   TJ  .VISING  the  young  is  an  acute  problem  in  -^-elephant  land.  Usually,  when  an  elephant  has  reached  the  age  of  forty-live  or  fifty—per-  haps half  its  normal  captivity  lifetime — it  has  developed  the  great  patience  for  which  ele-  phants are  noted.  Experience  seems  to  have  taught  them  that  antagonism  and  bullishness  do  no  good.   The  capricious,  experimental  desires  of  youth  give  way  to  solid,  common  sense  and  patience.   Sometimes,  of  course,  a  cocky  young  ele-  phant of  twenty-five  or  thirty  years  refused  to  respond  to  Wally's  bribes  or  coaxing.  They  had  to  be  prodded  a  little  bit  with  the  bull  hook.   Hut  Wally  soon  learned  a  trick  that  tamed  them.  He'd  chain  them  to  a  middle-aged  ele-  phant.   Then,  when  the  young  scamps  commenced  their  capers,  up  would  go  Mr.  Elephant's  trunk  and  "whango!"  another  sadder  but  wiser  young  pachyderm  had  learned  a  lesson  in  deportment.   "Baldy,"  a  nine  and  a  half  ton  bull,  was  Wally's  favorite  disciplinarian.  Baldy  had  been  a  man-about-elephant-town  in  his  younger  days  and  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  he  knew  most  of  the  facts  of  life.   His  great  size,  the  true  standard  of  elephant  elegance,  seemed  to  impress  the  young  fellows.   Baldy  had  wisdom,  too.  He  didn't  raise  his  trunk  except  as  a  last  resort.  He  chinned  with  his  charges.   Perhaps  he  whispered  lessons  learned  in  his  own  wicked  youth.   Anyway,  Baldy  had  a  sense  of  sympathetic  understanding  which  sent  a  young  bull  from  his  chains  wiser,  steadier,  almost  inspired  some-  times.   "You  know,"  said  Wally,  thinking  back  to  the  days  of  Baldy,  "I  think  the  secret  of  success  with  children,  or  grown-ups  either,  lies  in  really  understanding  them.   "Old  Baldy  knew  every  youngster  in  that  herd.  He  understood  their  good  points  and  their  bad  points,  and  I'm  convinced  that  he  knew  exactly  the  kind  of  treatment  each  of  them  most  needed."   He  smiled.   "I  could  trust  old  Baldy."   You  can  trust  Wally  Beery',  too.  Looking  at  him,  I  could  easily  imagine  what  a  splendid  tutor  little  Carol  Ann  and  her  brothers  are  going  to  have,  could  understand  how  thor-  oughly they  will  learn  to  love  this  rugged,  kindly  man  whose  twinkling  eyes  look  out  upon  a  world  he  has  found  completely  satis-  factory.   "VX  THAT  else  did  you  learn  from  the  ele-   **  phants?"  I  asked.  "What  about  the  female  of  the  species?"   Wally  roared  with  laughter.  "Oh,  that,"  he  said.  "Well,  you're  going  to  be  disappointed,  I'm  afraid.  'Popsy,'  our  biggest  female,  was  a  killer.  And  the  only  thing  I  learned  about  women  from  her  was  that  when  a  female  goes  wild  there  is  no  male  who  can  compete  with  her. "   That  is  another  theory  of  ex-elephant  tamer  Beery.   And  it's  not  so  dumb,  at  that!    SHOCKING   to  endanger  others  with  germ-filled  handkerchiefs    Disposable  Tissues  Safer  Than  Handkerchiefs!    YOU  must  expect  others  to  shudder  if  you  flourish  a  germ-filled  handkerchief.  No  one  wants  to  catch  your  cold  —  and  germs  are  easily  spread  from  handker-  chiefs. Tests  show  that  nearly  all  germs  may  be  dislodged  from  handkerchief   fibers.   Kleenex  is  safe!   Kleenex  fibers,  on  the  other  hand,  clutch  germs  tightly.  It  is  almost  impossible  to  dislodge  germs  from  Kleenex  in  any  sort  of  scientific  test.  Dangerous  germs  are  therefore  held  safely  em-  bedded until  the  Kleenex  can  be  destroyed.   Thus  does  the  super-absor-  bency  of  Kleenex  protect  your  health,  protect  others.  This  same  absorbency  protects  your  comfort,  too.  Kleenex  absorbs  moisture  instantly,  without  rubbing  or  irritation.  It  is  soft    and  gentle  as  down  —  always  soothing,  no  matter  how  tender  and  inflamed  your  skin.   Many  ways  to  buy  Kleenex   Carry  Kleenex  always!  For  general  use,  buy  Kleenex  tissues  in  convenient  rolls  and  packages — a  generous  quantity  newly  priced  at  25  cents.  A  larger  size  Kleenex — three  times  usual  size  with  tissues  as  large  as  a  man's  handkerchief,  is  also  available;  and  smart,  bordered  tissues  in  the  form  of  finished  handker-  chiefs known  as  'Kerfs.

Jamison:  What  do  you  think  of  our  American  skyscrapers?   Roland  Young:  You  mean,  what  do  I  think  of  their  sex-appeal?   Jamison:  Do  you  think  skirts  will  come  down  any  longer?   Roland  Young:   Longer  than  the  skyscrapers?   Jamison  (laughing  merrily):  Oh,  I'm  sorry;  I  got  my  notes  mixed.  Those  last  three  ques-  tions are  the  ones  I  asked  Lady  Wimberley  when  she  got  off  the  ship.   Roland  Young:  I  knew  it  all  the  time.  Look  carefully  now.  (He  sits  up  and  slowly  turns  his  head  to  reveal  his  profile.)  Don't  you  notice  anything?   Jamison  (laughing) :  It's  pretty  funny,  all  right.

Robert  goes  to  the  front  door  and  then  appears  in  the  den.   Robert:  Mr.  Young,  a  man  wants  to  know  if  you  are  aware  that  most  actors  die  in  the  poor-house  and  can  he  have  fifteen  minutes  of  your  time?   Roland  Young:  Good  heavens!  Tell  him  to  go  out  and  call  on  me  at  the  poor-house.  I  moved  there  last  week.   Robert  disappears  noiselessly.   Jamison:  Now,  about  your  love  letters,  Mr.  Young.  For  some  reason  or  other,  women  find  you  fascinating.  When  you  play  in  a  picture  with  a  handsome  young  hero,  and  you  are  a  villain,  you  get  more  fan  letters  and  mash  notes  than  the  hero  does.   Roland  Young:  I  paper  the  walls  of  my  bed-  room with  them.  Wait  a  minute,  please.  Yes,  Robert?   Robert  has  come  back.   Robert:  The  man  at  the  door  wants  to  know,  sir,  if  you  are  aware  that  forty  thousand    babies  are  crying  because  their  fathers  were  thoughtless?   Roland  Young  (firmly):  They're  not  mine!  I  had  nothing  to  do  with  it!   Robert:    No  sir.    I'll  tell  him,  sir.  Robert  goes  out  again.   Jamison:  Let's  see,  what  were  we  talking  about?   Roland  Young:  Skirts  on  skyscrapers.  You  may  quote  me  as  saying,  young  man,  that  I'm  all  for  it.  The  Youngs  are  nothing  if  not  moral.  We  put  skirts  on  our  piano,  even,  so  its  legs  won't  show.  You  know,  that's  a  funny  thing.  The  shorter  the  skirt,  the  more  the  leg  is  like  a  piano  leg!   Jamison:  Sex-appeal!  Now,  Mr.  Young,  why  have  you  got  it?  Garbo  has  it  because  she  has  eyelashes.  Dietrich  has  it  because  she  has  legs.    Have  you  eyelashes  or  legs?   Roland  Young  (dropping  his  eyes  modestly):  Well,  I  have  some  eyelashes  and  I  have  legs.   Jamison:  About  these  letters  you  get.  What  is  the  most  passionate  letter  you've  ever  re-  ceived?   Roland  Young:  One  from  the  Gas  Company  saying,  "Please  remit,  or  you'll  be  cooking  over  a  bonfire  by  tomorrow  night. "   Jamison:  But  thousands  of  letters  are  sent  to  you.  Maybe  the  mailman  doesn't  give  them  to  you.  Have  you  ever  done  anything  that  might  make  him  sore  at  you?   Roland  Young:  No,  except  that  I  bit  him  on  the  leg  once.  We  were  playing  dog.  He  was  the  little  dog  and  I  was  the  big  dog.   Jamison:  1  think  I'm  going  crazy.  I  suppose  you  play  mailman,  too,  when  you're  not  playing  dog?   Roland  Young:  You  mean,  would  I  like  to  be  a  mailman?   Jamison:  What  the— ?  Well,  all  right.  Would  you  like  to  be  a  mailman?   Roland  Young:  How  are  you  spelling  it,  m-a-i-1  or  m-a-l-e?   Jamison:  How  am  I — ?  Never  mind,  never  mind.  Maybe  we'd  better  forget  all  about  it.  Now,  to  get  back  to  the  interview,  Mr.  Young,  just  give  me  an  idea  of  how  the  let-  ters you  get  from  women  usually  read,  will  you?    What  do  they  usually  say?    Roland  Young:  I  can  remember  exactly  what  they  say.  They  say,  "Dear  Roland:  I  have  seen  you  on  the  screen  and  fallen  wildly  in  love  with  you.  I  am  a  married  girl  with  nine  children.  Our  ice-box  leaks.  We  have  no  radio.  I  need  new  linoleum  in  the  kitchen.  There  is  a  hole  in  the  roof.  Also,  there  is  a  hole  in  Willie's  pants.  My  husband's  car,  a  broken-down  old  1933  Cadillac,  needs  new  tires,  a  new  motor,  new  fenders  and  a  new  top.  I  have  added  all  these  up  carefully  and  they  come  to  exactly  $458.62.  Please  sit  down  right  away,  before  you  forget  it,  and  send  me  a  check  for  $917.24,  because  my  sister-in-law's  family  is  in  a  pretty  bad  way,  too.  "    What  are  you  making  faces  for?   Jamison:  Do  they  say  "What  are  you  making  faces  for?''  in  the  letters?   Roland  Young:   No,  I'm  asking  you  that.   Jamison:  I'm  not  making  a  face.  I'm  just  try-  ing to  think  how  to  spell  linoleum.  Do  you  really  get  letters  like  that?    Are  you  serious?   Roland  Young:    You  don't  know  how  serious!   Jamison:  Don't  you  ever  get  any  other  kind  of  letters?   Roland  Young:  Not  from  women.  I  get  them  from  men  offering  to  punch  me  in  the  eye,  sometimes.   Robert  reappears  in  the  den.   Robert:  Mr.  Young,  that  man  won't  go  away.  (Brightly)  But  I  know  who  he  is,  now.  He's  an  insurance  agent!   Roland  Young:  Robert,  you  always  were  one  to  catch  on  to  things  in  a  hurry.  Go  up  on  the  roof  and  pour  a  bucket  of  boiling  tar  on  him.   Robert:   Yes  sir.   Robert  goes  out  again,  hunting  for  a  bucket.   Roland  Young  (holding  out  his  hand):  Well,  Mr.  Jamison,  that  was  a  very  nice  interview.  You  must  come  around  sometime  and  we'll  have  another  interview.  I'm  sorry  you  must  be  going.   Jamison  (who  had  no  intention  of  going) :  But  why — ?   Roland  Young:  Shh!  I'm  going  to  hide  under  the  bed  for  awhile.    Insurance  agents!

"CATHER'S  job  of  organizing  Camp  Knox  was  *-  finished;  he  was  ordered  to  Washington.  The  city  was  still  overrun  with  post-war  activity  and  he  found  it  impossible  to  stretch  the  always  insufficient  income  to  pay  the  prices  asked  for  accommodation.   Once  more  the  family  split.   Mother,  Dorothy  and  I  went  to  New  York,  paid  an  enormous  price  for  a  dismal  flat  in  the  Nineties,  and  set  out  to  tackle  the  biggest  city  of  them  all.   I  got  a  job  as  secretary  in  a  brokerage  office;  Dody  presented  herself  at  the  home  offices  of  a  life  insurance  company  and  was  placed  in  their  welfare  division  at  $12.50  a  week.  She  made  a  little  extra  money  reading  books  for  Famous-Players,  typing  her  synopses  at  night  and  delivering  them  before  reporting  at  the  life  insurance  office  in  the  morning.   108    About  three  months  of  this  was  all  she  could  stand.  For  several  days  mother  and  I  noticed  that  she  was  coming  and  going  with  a  most  detached  air — she  scarcely  touched  her  food —  lapsed  into  great  silences — something  was  cer-  tainly brewing.   At  the  end  of  a  week  it  broke— she  had  braved  Greenwich  Village  and  tried  out  for  a  part  in  "Inheritors,''  the  forthcoming  Provincetown  Players'  production.   When  asked  for  her  name  at  the  door,  she  had  gulped  and  blurted  out  the  first  syllables  that  came  to  mind.  "Ann  Harding  "  was  written  on  the  application.   She  walked  into  the  theater  and  approached  the  lean-visaged,  hawk-eyed  director,  Jasper  Deeter.  He  took  a  quick  glance  at  her,  turned  to  Susan  Glaspell,  the  author,  and  said,  "She  might  do  for  one  of  the  giggling  girls,  Susan."  Smarting  under  that  crack,  Dody  was  told  to  come  back  the  next  day,  and  arrived  before  the  other  members  of  the  cast.   She  felt  a  bit  lost  in  the  gloomy  theater.  Deeter  loomed  up  in  the  darkness,  peered  at  her  under  enormous  eyebrows  and,  recognizing    one  of  the  giggling  girls,  sat  down  and  lit  a  cig-  arette. He  talked  to  her  for  about  half  an  hour,  then  stopped  short;  his  face  suddenly  lighted  up  with  surprise  as  he  said,  "You  seem  able  to  listen — and  understand.  Read  the  last  act  of  this  play  and  in  an  hour  or  so  we'll  see  what  you  can  do  with  Madeline"  (the  leading  role) .   DEETER  had  been  able  to  discern  in  this  rather  gauche  "country  "girl,  raw  material,  sprung  from  nowhere,  that  to  him  showed  promise — great  promise.   She  got  the  part,  and  commenced  her  career  with  a  stellar  role.   Not  a  word  of  the  whole  business  had  been  mentioned  at  home  until  the  thing  was  de-  cided. Then,  in  more  or  less  of  a  whisper,  she  announced:   "I  am  going  on  the  stage — I  have  a  part  and  start  rehearsal  tomorrow."   It  was  nothing  less  than  a  bombshell.  Mother  and  I  were  tremendously  proud  and  excited,  but  one  word  came  simultaneously  from  three  mouths:    "Father!"    Photoplay  Magazine  for  March,  1933    109    Of  all  the  routes  to  eternal  destruction,  the  unhallowed  stage  was  easily  the  most  direct,  according  to  his  traditionally  New  England  conscience.   A  certain  amount  of  that  same  conscience  made  it  quite  impossible  for  Dody  to  continue  accepting  father's  support  when  she  was  em-  barking on  a  career  so  opposed  to  his  conceptions.   BY  the  time  she  told  us  the  news  she  had  already  found  a  thoroughly  chaperoned  "club,"  maintained  near  the  theater  for  girls  who  earned  twenty-five  dollars  a  week  or  less,  and  there  she  decided  to  live.   The  child  had  gone — she  had  suddenly  be-  come "Ann  Harding" — but  the  characteristics  of  the  child  remained,  and  brought  her  through  the  difficult  years  to  come,  triumphant.   Dorothy  Gatley  has  now  renamed  herself  Ann  Harding  and  faces  the  first  crisis  of  her  life.  Next  month  Edith  Gatley  Nash  tells  of  Ann's  first  stage  appearance,  her  break  with  her  father,  her  grinding  years  in  stock  and  the  second  grim  crisis  in  her  career    Bless  You,  My  Children !   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  71  ]   years  one  of  the  most  popular  stars  who  has  ever  appeared  on  the  screen.  Alec  says  that  in  the  old  silent  days  she  always  spoke  her  lines  under  her  breath.   "The  rest  of  us  would  find  it  pretty  difficult  to  follow  her,"  he  remembers,  "and  so  we  wouldn't  know  just  when  to  take  our  cues.  On  the  other  hand,  some  of  the  old-time  actors,  who  had  played  in  stock  for  years,  would  act  at  the  top  of  their  voices  and  even  when  the  director  called  'Cut ! '  they  wouldn't  stop.  They  would  just  keep  on  going  until  they  had  finished  the  speech."   ALEC  thinks  that  Constance  Cummings  is  the  most  promising  young  woman  screen  personality  whom  he  has  appeared  with  recently,  though  Garbo  stands  out  among  his  recollec-  tions as  the  greatest  personality  of  all.  Though  she  was  not  actually  his  screen  daughter,  he  was  her  fatherly  counselor  in  "Mata  Hari,"  the  man  who  defended  her  when  she  was  accused  as  a  spy  and  sentenced  to  die.   "Garbo  has  the  most  expressive  personality  of  anybody  at  present  on  the  screen,"  he  will  tell  you.  "  She  is  truly  a  great  artist  who  can  convey  more  with  one  look,  one  word,  or  one  touch  of  the  hand  than  most  actresses  can  get  across  in  a  whole  reel  of  film.   "She  is  neither  reticent  nor  solitary  when  one  gets  to  know  her,  but  utterly  charming.  How-  ever, she  is  very  particular  about  who  gets  to  know  her."   WHEN  Alec  was  ill  Garbo  sent  a  bouquet  of  roses  which  he  says  was  the  biggest  he  has  ever  seen.   "I  hadn't  known  her  long  then,  either,"  he  said  appreciatively,  "but  it  just  goes  to  show  how  essentially  human  Garbo  is.  On  the  set  she  puts  up  with  a  lot  from  other  people —  t:iir>'.rs  that  I  wouldn't  put  up  with  for  five  minutes  myself.   "Although  die  has  been  studying  English  for  a  comparative*;,'  short  time,  she  can  detect  any  imperfection  of  feeling,  any  false  note,  quicker  even  than  the  person  who  wrote  the  lines.   "That's  how  strong  the  dramatic  instinct  is  within  her.  And  she  is  never  at  rest  while  working,  but  paces  back  and  forth,  forth  and  back  on  the  set  muttering  her  lines  to  herself  all  day.'*    The  real  test  of  a   Laxative!    Is  it  mild  enough  for  little  children?   ONE  of  the  important  requirements  of  a  lax-  ative is  gentleness  in  action.  Violence  has  no  place  in  a  laxative  for  a  person  of  any  age —  harsh  cathartics  often  do  more  harm  than  good!   Many  a  grown-up  friend  of  Ex-Lax  first  learned  of  its  gentle  yet  effective  action  after  giving  it  to  a  child  in  the  family.   But  Ex-Lax  is  not  merely  a  children's  laxative.  To  get  "results"  without  harmful  after-effects  is  just  as  important  to  grown-ups  as  to  little  children.  And  so,  gradually  and  surely,  Ex-Lax  became  the  all-family  laxative  in  millions  of  homes.   Ex-Lax— when  Nature  fails!   Ex-Lax  is  mildness  itself!  Ex-Lax  merely  gives  the  intestines  a  gentle  nudge,  stimulating  them  to  action  without  violence.  It  doesn't  disturb  diges-  tion. It  does  not  gripe.  It  isn't  habit-forming.

Julie  llaydon,  RKO  Star   WxNZ    Photoplay  Magazine  for  March,  1933   Alec  has  led  a  sort  of  dual  screen  life  with  Louise  Fazenda.  He  has  been  her  father  and  has  had  to  make  love  to  her.   "She  was  perfectly  at  ease  when  I  was  her  father,"  he  smiled  reminiscently,  "but  on  the  other  occasion  she  was  rather  terrified  at  first  for  fear  that  she  might  shock  me.  She  told  me  afterwards  that  she  thought  me  such  a  dignified  sort  of  chap.  However,"  and  the  kindly  eyes  twinkle  amusedly  as  he  adds  this — "she  found  me  quite  receptive,  I  think."   Gloria  Swanson  was  the  star  whom  Alec  found  easiest  to  work  with,  and  he  found,  too,  that  she  had  the  coolest  nerve.  It  was  during  the  making  of  "The  Great  Moment"  that  this  incident  occurred:   "We  were  out  on  location  in  the  Chatsworth  Hills,"  he  says,  "and  in  one  scene,  after  riding  some  distance,  Gloria  had  to  get  off  her  horse.  She  got  off — and  almost  stepped  upon  a  huge  rattlesnake,  lying  there  coiled.  But  Gloria,  instead  of  fainting,  pinned  the  snake's  head  on  the  ground  with  the  handle  of  her  riding-crop  while  one  of  the  men  killed  it.

In  a  picture  with  Clara  Kimball  Young,  Alec  actually  played  her  screen  father  while  her  real  father,  Ed  Kimball,  played  one  of  the  other  parts.   "They  chose  me,"  said  Alec,  "because  they  said  that  I  looked  more  like  the  type  of  father  she  should  have  than  her  real  father."   "D  ECENTLY  Alec  has  been  on  tour  on  the  -^vaudeville  stage,  telling  audiences  his  experi-  ences on  the  screen.  As  he  speaks  and  the  names  of  his  film  children  fall  from  his  lips,  face  after  face  is  conjured  up  for  ears  that  still  remember  them —   Doris  Kenyon,  Eleanor  Boardman,  Mabel  Normand,  Betty  Compson,  May  McAvoy,  Jacqueline  Logan,  Norma  Talmadge,  Bebe  Daniels,  Billie  Dove,  Lila  Lee,  Lois  Moran,  Clara  Bow,  Dorothy  Mackaill,  Joan  Bennett,  Anna  Q.

Glorias  New  Troubles    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  35    heap  beside  me  in  her  gorgeous  apartment  at  a  hotel  in  London,  I  accidentally  called  her  "child."  The  word  slipped  from  my  subcon-  scious because  it  was  so  fitting.  Women  who  live  on  emotional  gusts  as  does  Gloria  always  remain,  somehow,  like  children.  The  world  calls  them  sophisticated.  But  the  world  does  not  know.   Truly  sophisticated  women  are  those  who  never  feel  deeply.  Those  who  cry  from  suffer-  ing one  moment  and  from  joy  the  next  remain  peculiarly  untouched  by  their  hardships — like  infants.  It  is  only  when  tears  do  not  come  that  woman  is  truly  sophisticated.   SO  Gloria  listened  to  advice  in  this  case,  whereas  a  truly  sophisticated  or  "hard-  boiled"  person  with  her  background  would  have  learned  long  before  then  not  to  listen.   She  had  listened  too,  to  advice  on  how  to  make  this  "cheap"  picture  in  London.  When  she  was  told  that  a  certain  American  director  had  written  the  original  story  and  dialogue,  and  had  directed  a  successful  picture  in  Holly-  wood, she  did  not  question  the  statement.  Where  a  true  sophisticate-in-pictures  would  have  cabled  or  telephoned  Hollywood  to  have  verified  whether  he  was,  indeed,  the  master  of  all  the  studio  arts,  Gloria  believed.  Later  =he  learned  there  had  been  many  minds  on  that  Hollywood  picture.   Lack  of  ordinary  sense  on  her  part?  Of  course.  I  do  not  claim  Gloria  has  ordinary  sense.  Those  who  always  remain  young  usually  haven't.  Those  who  achieve  greatness  do  not  follow  the  charted  minds.   She  also  listened  when  it  was  suggested  that  her  new  husband,  Michael  Farmer,  play  the  leading  man.   Farmer  is  no  fool.  He  knew  he  lacked  act-  ing experience  and  that  talking  pictures  require  trained  people.      He  protested.   But  Gloria  believed.  She  was  told  of  a  young  actor  in  America  who  had  been  directed  without  experience  and  had  proved  a  sensa-  tion. Again,  Gteria  didn't  check  the  story.  She  urged  Michael  to  play  the  role.   And  again  this  was  typical  of  Gloria.  She  was  still  in  bed  from  giving  birth  to  this  hus-  band's child.  She  wanted  him  with  her.  When  a  woman  like  Gloria  loves,  she  gives  of  her  all  to  the  one  loved.  If  Michael  Farmer  could  be  directed  so  he  would  be  a  sensation —   So  the  dissenting  husband  was  persuaded.   They  shot  the  first  scenes  at  Cannes.  There  was  no  script.    Remember  one  man  was  doing    script  and  direction.  Gloria  thought  every-  thing had  been  taken  care  of.   Again  foolish  but  typical  of  the  woman.   The  first  shots  were  in  a  casino  where  play-  boy Farmer  had  lost  and  won  fifty  thousand  dollars  in  one  evening  not  long  before.  It  was  his  habitat  as  a  sportsman,  but  not  his  habitat  as  an  actor.  There  were  no  screens  to  protect  him  from  the  crowd  which  had  gathered  to  watch  the  making  of  Gloria  Swanson's  new  picture.  Helen  Hayes  and  Charlie  MacArthur  were  among  those  on  the  sidelines.  There  were  dukes  and  lords  and  ladies  and  marquesses.  Friends  of  the  Farmers.  And  hosts  of  stran-  gers.   New-actor  Farmer  felt  he  should  have  had  privacy  for  his  first  shot.  Training.  What  did  he  know  of  timing  and  expressions  and  the  best-side-to-the-camera?  With  all  this  mob  looking —   He  walked  off.  You  can  picture  the  scene.  Any  of  us  who  have  read  about  the  making  of  pictures  need  no  detailed  description.   The  outdoor  scenes  were  finished  somehow.  In  some  inexplainable  way  picture  scenes  al-  ways get  finished  no  matter  how  many  actors  walk  off  or  how  much  it  rains  or  fogs.   The  troupe  started  back  for  London  where  the  interiors  were  to  be  made.  There  was  still  no  script.   Then,  one  of  those  chance  occurrences,  which  look  so  unimportant  beforehand  and  assume  such  gigantic  proportions  afterwards.  The  troupe  was  traveling  on  a  slow  train.  A  mem-  ber had  been  in  one  of  those  horrible  conti-  nental train  wrecks  on  the  way  down.  She  had  spent  two  hours  describing  it  to  Gloria  just  before  they  started  back!   WHEN  Gloria  and  Michael  were  in  their  compartment,  Gloria  was  seized  with  fear.  She  just  knew  that  poky  train,  which  was  jerk-  ing and  rattling  its  way  over  a  shaky  road  bed  was  going  to  be  wrecked.  She  couldn't  sleep,  tier  nerves  were  edging  to  one  of  those  cas-  cades in  her  hectic  stream  of  life.   Then  she  had  an  idea!  She  and  Michael  had  spent  such  a  marvelous  time  at  Marseilles  when  love  was  first  bloomiitft.  It  had  been  like  a  beautiful  dream —   "Let's  slip  off  at  Marseilles,  Michael.  Re-  member the  glorious  days  and  nights  we  spent  there.  Let's  not  tell  anyone.  Oh,  it  will  be  wonderful.    We  will  forget  all  our  worries — ."   Just  another  woman  trying  to  recapture  glories  once  lived.    Fhotoplay  Magazine  for  March,  1933    l  I  I    They  slipped  off — leaving  only  a  cute  little  note  of  explanation.  And  the  newspapers  car-  ried the  story  they  were  quarreling  so  about  Michael's  not  wanting  to  finish  the  picture  that  they  had  to  get  off  the  train!   When  she  reached  London  for  the  interior  shots  the  script  was  not  yet  finished.   When  Gloria  saw  the  director-author  at  the  tennis  matches,  she  remonstrated  on  the  time  he  spent  for  sports  and  not  for  work — but  she  was  chided  for  rushing  genius.  Oh,  it  was  such  a  typically  Gloria  Swanson  hectic  situation!   And  then — great  gusts  of  awakening!  An-  other director.  Another  cameraman.  High-  speed American  efficiency!  Gloria  sat  for  twelve  hours  every  day  for  more  than  a  week  working  with  a  new  writer  to  finish  that  script  before  Genevieve  Tobin  and  other  members  of  the  cast  should  arrive  from  America.  It  was  a  race!  Could  they  finish  a  new  script  before  the  boat  docked?  All  that  fire  of  her  nature  went  into  work.  No  one  will  ever  know  how  much  of  that  dialogue  is  hers  and  how  much  belongs  to  the  one  who  is  given  credit.   HTHE  race  was  a  tie.  But  Gloria  was  ex-  *■  hausted.  She  knew  she  was  going  to  break.  She  went  to  a  secluded  spot  on  the  edge  of  one  of  England's  quiet  rivers  to  rest.  All  the  shots  not  needing  her  could  be  taken  first.  She  left  Michael  Farmer  to  run  the  picture.   And  it  was  there  that  he  acquired  the  taste  for  the  champagne-allure  of  pictures!  He  was  no  longer  the  leading  man.  He  had  a  small  part.  But  he  was  the  producer — doing  the  work  of  his  producer- wife.   In  Hollywood,  he  had  not  been  able  to  under-  stand why  Gloria  could  not  keep  her  dinner  appointments.  When  she  telephoned  she  could  not  get  away  for  dinner  but  must  remain  at  the  studio,  he  had  writhed.  Now  one  day  from  London,  he  had  said  that  he  would  surely  be  down  to  her  retreat  for  dinner.  He  didn't  even  telephone.  At  nine,  Gloria  called  the  studio.  He  was  so  busy  with  retakes,  rushes,  etc.,  he  had  forgotten  his  promise.  The  next  day,  Gloria  reminded  him  it  had  been  their  wedding  anniversary!   There  is  no  doubt,  he  has  caught  the  picture-  fever.  Gloria  was  still  afraid  of  a  breakdown.  After  all,  she  left  her  baby  when  it  was  less  than  three  weeks  old  to  start  the  picture.  She  must  have  something  to  do.   She  took  up  knitting.  And  between  every  scene  she  made  on  that  picture,  she  knit  with  the  haste  of  a  woman  who  feared  she  couldn't  get  a  sweater  to  the  frontline  trenches  before  winter  set  in.   Some  way,  the  picture  was  finished.  It  is  not  the  best  picture  made,  but  Gloria,  herself,  looks  more  beautiful  than  for  years.  And  it  is  her  best  dramatic  work  since  "The  Trespasser."   Incidentally,  she  looks  more  beautiful  in  life.  About  eighteen  years  old  that  afternoon,  as  she  sat  beside  me  telling  me  bits  about  the  film.   Naturally,  there  have  been  other  complica-  tions. I  can  only  give  you  a  bird's  eye  view.  After  all,  you  can't  describe  whirlpools,  cas-  cades and  miniature  Niagara  Falls  of  emotion  all  in  one  article.  There  was  the  furniture  in  Hollywood.  She  had  ordered  some  on  con-  signment and  when  she  left  she  said  she  didn't  want  it.  The  furniture  man  thought  she'd  kept  it  too  long  on  consignment  and  sued.   PT"HEN,  there  was  the  artist  who  painted  her  ■*■  picture  some  years  ago.  She  thought  she  didn't  need  to  buy  it  unless  she  wanted  it.  Now,  he's  suing  because  she  didn't  pay  for  it.  He  has  the  picture.   There  are  rumors  of  her  unhappiness  with  her  husband.   I  will  never  prophesy  about  the  future  of  Gloria.  She  and  Michael  appear  happy.  They  are  both  mad  about  one  of  the  most  beautiful  babies  I  have  ever  seen  and  they  seem  to  feel  that  ai.1  this  hectic  straining  has  drawn  them  to  a  more  complete  understanding  of  each  other.  But  I  will  never  bet  on  Gloria.  I  have  known  her  too  long.  Whirlpools  and  cascades  and  Niagara  Falls  forever.  That  is  the  one  certainty  about  her.    NOW    there's  no    excuse    But   how   ofte  n   ordinary   powder   leaves  the  nose   looking  like  this   after  half  an    hour    Of  course  you're  lovely  when  you  leave  your  dressing  table!  But  how  long  do  you  stay  that  way?  How  many  times  in  an  eve-  ning do  you  have  to  look  in  a  mirror  to  be  sure  that  you're  even  presentable?   For  certainly  few  things  are  more  dis-  concerting than  a  nose  that  has  shed  its  powder,  and  stands  out  from  a  beautiful  face  like  an  unkind  and  ugly  beacon  light.  Can  you  even  count  the  number  of  times  you  have  to  powder  during  the  day?   All  that  is  over  now.  Pompeian  has  cre-  ated a  powder  that  will  cling,  not  for    minutes,  but  for  hours!  It  doesn't  coat  the  face,  as  old-fashioned  "clinging"  powders  do.

The  prize  winners  for  the  Harold  Lloyd-PHOTOPLAY  "gag"  contest  have  been  selected!  And,  oh  boy — Holly-  wood's professional  gag  men  had  better  shine  up  their  wares.  For  we  received  some  hum-  dingers in  this  lot!  In  fact,  the  judges  were  snowed  under  for  weeks  by  such  a  flood  of  uproarious  ideas  from  all  points  of  the  globe,  that  they've  decided  to  knock  off  for  a  couple   First  Prize,  $250   Bruce  Patterson  541  North  Wood  St.,  Chicago,  111.    of  days  to  recover  from  the  strain  of  laughing.   So  watch  out  for  the  next  Harold  Lloyd  pic-  tures— some  of  them  will  surely  carry  a  few  of  the  prize-winning  "funny"  situations!   Right  here  and  now,  we'd  like  to  say  that  Harold  is  mighty  grateful  to  all  those  contest-  ants who  took  part  in  this  hilarious  campaign.  And  if  you're  one  of  those  who  failed  to  make  a  ringer,  just  remember  the  old  adage,  "Great   Second  Prize,  $100   Bruce  Russell  3814  Mullen  Way,  Los  Angeles,  Calif.    minds  run  in  the  same  channel."  Some  par-  ticularly good  ideas  were  rejected  because  they  had  been  used  before,  although  the  contestants  were  quite  unaware  of  this  fact  when  they  sub-  mitted them.   To  those  lucky  ones  who  won  the  unanimous  vote  of  the  judges  for  first,  second,  third  and  fourth  prizes — we'd  like  to  say,  "Good  work,  keep  it  up!"

It  should  improve  your  skin  and  complexion  in  no  time!   Skin  troubles  indicate  a  disordered  con-  dition of  your  system — usually  constipa-  tion or  a  run-down  nervous  state.  Both  of  these  common  ailments  are  frequently  caused  by  the  shortage  of  vitamins  B  and  G  in  the  average  diet.  To  correct  this  short-  age you  need  a  food  super-rich  in  these  health-building  elements.   Yeast  Foam  Tablets  are  pure  yeast  and  yeast  is  the  richest  known  food  source  of  the  vitamins  B  and  G.  They  contain  con-  centrated stores  of  these  nutritive  elements  which  strengthen  the  digestive  and  intes-  tinal organs,  which  give  tone  to  your  nerv-  ous system.  With  the  true  causes  of  your  trouble  corrected,  you  en-  joy new  health  and  new  beauty.  Eruptions  and  blemishes  vanish.  Your  complexion  becomes  clear  and  glowing.

In  many  common  foods  they  are  entirely  lacking.  Yeast  Foam  Tablets  are  so  help-  ful because  they  supply  these  vitamins  in  such  great  abundance.   You  will  like  Yeast  Foam  Tablets.  They  are  very  different  from  ordinary  yeast.  They  have  a  pleasing,  nut-like  taste  and  they  are  pasteurized.

Photoplay  Magazine  for  March,  1933    121    Screen    Memories    From    Photoplay   15  Years  Ago    NO  question  about  it — we  were  getting  decidedly  war- con-  scious in  our  issue  of  March,  1918.  On  almost  the  first  page  rifles  peeped  at  you,  Hollywood  lights,  called  to  guard  duty  with  a  local  reserve  unit,  held  them.  D.  W.  Griffith,  fresh  back  from  filming  "Hearts  of  the  World"  behind  the  battlelines  with  the  Gishes  and  Bobby  Harron,  told  us  the  real  war  was  too  big  for  any  film.  Then  a  touch  of  pro-  fessional pride,  from  the  man  who  started  the  "million  dollar"  showmanship.  "Producers  often  boast  of  set-  tings and  actors  costing  a  million  dollars.  The  settings  for  the  picture  I  took  cost  several  billion  dollars."   Among  present-day  luminaries  doing  their  bit  was  Douglas  Fairbanks,  Jr.,  a  chubby  little  fellow  in  knee  pants.  We  said  he  made  his  screen  debut  with  a  bit  in  dad's  "A  Modern  Musketeer" — proceeds  to  go  to  the  Fairbanks  chapter  of  the  Red  Cross.'    Jack  Pickford    A  sadder  note,  apropos  the  recent  death  of  jack  Pickford:  It  was  fifteen  years  ago  this  month  that  we  reviewed  his  corking  "Tom  Sawyer."  And  in  our  gallery  of  feminine  beauties  we  presented  Olive  Thomas,  the  first  Mrs.  Jack,  whose  death  oc-  curred some  years  ago  in  the  same  Paris  hospital,  only  fifteen  years  back  to  Jack's  triumph — those  days  seem  centuries  away  now.  We  looked  back  five  years  to  patronize  the  well-meaning  films  of  1913  in  two  pages  of  pictures,  and  told  how  much  better  1918  was  doing  it.  Item:  "Shooting  the  Music"  told  how  Joseph  O'Sullivan  of  Mutual  saw  each  film  and  drew  up  "cue  sheets"  for  lady  pianists  in  the  theater.  Second  item:  The  New  California  theater  in  San  Francisco  was  free  from  pillars,  and  boasted  two  luxurious  lounges.  Charlie  Chaplin,  Mae  Murray,  Marion  Davies,  Mary  Pickford  com-  pleted the  mentions  of  luminaries  known  today.  Virginia  Pearson  graced  the  cover.    10  Years  Ago    STORMS  behind  and  storms  brewing,  but  meanwhile  a  breathing  spell — that  seemed  the  spirit  of  filmland  mirrored  in  our  issue  of  March,  1923.  Last  rum-  bles of  the  parting  storm  about  "movie  morals"  ...  an  editorial  speaking  our  mind  about  the  handling  of  the  Arbuckle  case.  And  a  melancholy  afternote  to  the  period  of  trouble  ...  a  two-  page  notice  and  farewell  tribute  occasioned  by  the  tragic  death  of  Wally  Reid.   New  thunderclouds  peeping  over  the  horizon.  .  .  .  One  article  told  of  Pola  Negri's  settling  to  work  on  "  Bella  Donna,"  after  a  sweep  from  Europe  that  had  us  agog  as  though  waiting  for  Lindbergh,  and  of  her  sweet,  simple  ways,  once  she  found  a  Polish  cook.  To  work,  did  we  say?  Ah,  mon  Dim,  yes — when  she  felt  like  it.  But  when  she  didn't,  it  would  not  be  ze  true  art,  no?  Mean-  while— grim  portent — Gloria  Swanson  had  just  acquired  a  grand,  new  twenty-two  room    Gloria  Swanson    house  and  we  showed  pictures.  That  was  all  in  March  on  that  situation  .  .  .  but  who,  even  then,  had  to  be  hit  by  lightning  before  knowing  that  storm  winds  were  beginning  to  blow?   The  reigning  king,  Rudolph  Valentino,  still  was  in  temporary  exile,  thanks  to  his  "strike"  over  the  quality  of  pictures  given  him  .  .  .  but  his  story  of  his  life  was  striding  bravely  into  its  second  installment,  telling  of  his  first  American  jobs  as  a  gardener  and  a  New  York  cafe  hoofer.  "A  Bill  of  Divorcement"  (silent  version,  starring  Constance  Binney)  received  mild  com-  mendation, and  we  thought  that  Harold  Lloyd  in  "Dr.  Jack"  was  not  quite  up  to  form.  "The  Hero"  with  John  Sainpolis  and  Barbara  La  Marr,  and  "The  Dangerous  Age"  with  Lewis  Stone  and  Cleo  Madison,  were  our  pick  as  the  two  best  of  the  month.  Death-house  and  gangster  pictures  were  having  a  run.  The  month's  cover  honors  went  to  Claire  Windsor.    5  Years  Ago    THE  studio  talk  in  March,  1928,  was  all  of  salary  cuts  and  "the  new  business  efficiency."  Previously  the  producers  had  an-  nounced a  straight  ten  per  cent  salary  cut.  Embattled  actors,  Conrad  Nagel  as  spokesman,  had  protested  .  .  .  later  dropped  hints  that  they  could  suggest  many  a  saving  through  cutting  out  executive  nonsense.  This  issue  chronicled  the  compromise :  Stars  were  to  be  paid  according  to  what  they  accomplished  at  the  box-office.  And  through  it  all,  there  was  not  one  whisper  of  the  earthquake  scheduled  to  sweep  through  filmland,  com-  mencing that  summer.  Nowhere  in  the  issue  did  the  ominous  word  "talkie"  appear.   Still,  the  chronicles  of  the  month's  doings  showed  that  many  who  were  to  attain  first  magnitude  in  the  firmament  of  speaking  stars,  were  already  starlets  in  the  silents.  Our  lead  article  told  of  a  distinctly  promising  fellow  named  Clive  Brook,  and  we  gave  Charlie  Farrell    a  full-page  picture  f  orhis  gorgeous  Cliico  in  "7th  Heaven."  Gary  Cooper  had  registered  one  of  the  six  best  films  on  the  month  with  his  "Beau  Sabreur,"  the  others  winning  this  accolade  being  Emil  Jannings,  Greta  Garbo,  Richard  Barthelmess,  Dolores  Del  Rio  and  Lars  Hanson.  Dolores,  praised  for  her  Ramona,  also  drew  a  rap  for  what  we  called  that  "badly-directed,  sappy  melo-  drama,'Gateway  of  the  Moon,'  "  a  South  Seas  undress  affair.  Joan  Crawford  was  very  much  present,  for  her  good  work  in  "Rose  Marie,"  as  a  demonstrator  of  make-up,  and  in  a  full  page  picture  with  limbs  even  more  in  evidence  than  the  well-known  Crawford  eyes  of  today.   Clara  Bow  was  telling  her  life  story  in  our  pages;  among  the  Wampas  girls  of  the  year  were  Sally  Eilers,  Sue  Carol  and  Lupe  Velez.  In  "The  Latest  from  Paris"  Norma  Shearer  turned  in  her  first  startling  clothes  display.  Mary  Philbin  had  the  cover.    SUNK!   A   MONTHLY  OCCURRENCE    Ailing  Alice !  A  martyr  every  month.  And  there's  an  absolute  antidote  for  such  pain!  Midol  lets  any  woman  menstruate  in  comfort.  Without  any  pain.  Not  one  twinge  during  entire  period.  A  miracle?  No;  it's  just  science.  Midol  is  the  discovery  of  specialists.  It  does  not  interfere  with  the  natural  process,  but  blocks  all  possibility  of  that  unnatural,  unnecessary  pain.  Midol  makes  the  menstrual  period  just  an  incident.  No  need  to  suffer;  no  need  to  be  inactive.  Take  a  Midol  tablet — and  be  yourself.  Ten  tiny  tablets,  in  a  slim  little  box  that  tucks  in  purse  or  pocket.  Simply  ask  for  Midol  at  any  drug  store.  It  is  not  a  narcotic.    122    Photoplay  Magazine  for  March,  1933    POPULAR    ST.    Clever  Girl!

The  Shadow  Stage    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  61  ]   THE  FACE  IN  THE  SKY— Fox   SPENCER  TRACY  is  a  breezy,  itinerant  sign-painter  who  rescues  Marian  Nixon,  a  poor  orphan,  from  the  hill-billies.  They  give  chase  and  she,  to  save  Tracy,  consents  to  marry  a  man  she  doesn't  love.  But  one  of  the  hill-billy  women  helps  Marian  to  escape  and  follow  Spencer.  A  very  good  cast  indeed,  but  they  couldn't  make  this  a  good  picture.   CHILD  OF  MANHATTAN— Columbia   CINDERELLA  in  a  dance-hall,  named  Nancy  Carroll,  is  plenty  cute  and  hands  in  a  nice  performance.  The  prince  is  John  Boles,  the  assistant-prince,  Buck  Jones.  The  prince  marries  the  girl,  making  a  grand  gesture,  she  thinks.  But  it  turns  out  that  he  loved  her  all  the  time !  Unbelievable  situations  made  plaus-  ible by  good  performances.     Entertaining.   LADIES  THE  Y  TALK  ABOUT— Warners   SHOWS  mostly  what  the  talked-of  ladies  think  about  while  behind  prison  bars,  with  Barbara  Stanwyck  heading  the  demonstration.  (Yes,  the  thoughts  are  a  bit  sexy.)  Barbara  blames  Preston  Poster,  a  childhood  sweetie  turned  reformer,  for  her  stretch,  and  the  death,  in  an  attempted  escape,  of  two  of  her  convict  pals.  Released,  she  shoots  Preston;  whereupon  the  two  find  they  love  each  other.  Well  done  but  too  grim  for  children.   TERROR  TRAIL— Universal   TOM  MIX  in  a  typically  Mixonian  story  about  a  hypocritical  leading  citizen  who  is  also  a  gang  boss,  a  band  of  horse  thieves,  and  a  lovely  girl — all  of  whom  he  rounds  up  as  befits  their  individual  cases  and  puts  exactly  where  they  belong.  Naomi  Judge  is  a  new  screen  face  as  the  girl,  and  does  very  nicely.  Fast  moving;  beautiful  photography.   THE  SECRET  OF  MADAME  BLANCHE  —M-C-M   THIS  adds  one  more  to  the  variations  of  the  "Madame  X"  theme — with  Irene  Dunne  doing  the  honors.  Douglas  Walton  is  the  son  who  actually  does  the  killing  for  which  his  mother  stands  trial,  but  Jean  Parker,  as  the  girl  he's  supposed  to  have  wronged,  rather  grabs  the  honors.  Lionel  Atwill  and  C.Henry  Gordon,  among  others,  lend  pleasing  support.   SCARLET  RIVER— RKO- Radio   DONE  to  give  some  young  "up  and  comers"  a  workout,  this  piece  also  tries  to  give  the  lowdown  on  filming  a  Western,  via  the  adven-  tures of  a  movie  company  on  a  ranch  location.  Tom  Keene  is  the  hero  who,  while  working  as  the  leading  film  cowboy,  rescues  Dorothy  Wil-  son, owner  of  the  ranch,  from  her  villainous  foreman,  Creighton  Chaney.  Rosco  Ates  and  Ed  Kennedy  offer  grand  comedy  support.   CRASHIN'  BROADWAY— Monogram   THIS  starts  out  on  Broadway  with  Rex  Bell  as  a  vaudeville  cowboy.  Then  he  goes  West  and  does  the  real  stuff.  Cut  from  then  on  to  the  accepted  he-man  pattern,  with  a  feud,  a  fight,  and  all  the  rest  of  it,  the  picture  stands  up  nicely.  Doris  Hill  is  virtuous  and  appealing  as  the  heroine,  and  Charles  King  is  a  villainous  villain.   NAG  AN  A—  Universal    Photoplay  Magazine  for  March,  1933   Waistline  frocks   cannot  be  worn   over   bulging  hips!    T  AID  in  Africa,  this  is  the  story  of  a  young  ■"scientist  (Melvyn  Douglas),  who  seeks  t<  conquer  sleeping  sickness  and  is  captured  b  a  native  king.    Tala  Birell,  following  him  int    Startling  photographic  proof  of  the  slenderizing  effect  of  the  Spencer.   THE  slim,  fitted  waist  of  today's  mode  presents  a  real  problem  to  the  woman  with    large    hips.    The    ordinary  corset  increases  the  incurve  at  the  waistline,  causing  the  hips  and  lower  back  to  bulge  out  and  appear  larger  than  they  really  are.    Some-  times the  abdomen  also  pouches  and  sags.   A  Spencer,  because  it   is  designed  to  slenderize   all  the  lines  of  the  figure,  not  only  gives   you  a  slim  waist  but  smooths  the  hips  and   thighs  into  long  slender  lines.   Is  it  worth  a  telephone  call  to  your  nearest  Spencer  Corsetiere  to  find  out  about  this?  You  will  find  her  listed  in  the  telephone  book.

The  same  young  ivoman  photographed  above  is  shown  at  the  left  wearing  a  smart  gown  from  Cor  beau  &  Cie  over  the  Spencer  designed  especially  for  her.

Any  druggist  can  put  this  up  or  you  can  mix  it  at  home  at  very  little  cost.  Apply  to  the  hair  twice  a  week  until  the  desired  shade  is  obtained.  It  imparts  color  to  streaked,  faded  or  gray  hair  and  makes  it  soft  and  glossy.  Barbo  will  not  color  the  scalp,  is  not  sticky  or  greasy  and  does  not  rub  off.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  March,  1933   the  wilderness,  also  is  captured  and  narrowly  escapes  being  fed  to  the  crocodiles.  Mike  Marita  as  the  Japanese  assistant  doctor  gives  the  out-  standing performance.   OFFICER  13— Allied   ""PHIS  is  all  about  a  motorcycle  cop's  ven-  ■*■  geance  upon  the  road-hog  slayer  of  a  brother  officer,  and  his  fight  against  "higher  ups"  try-  ing to  shield  the  culprit.  Monte  Blue  and  Lila  Lee  return  to  the  screen  as  the  avenger  and  the  judge's  daughter,  but  the  return  is  unauspicious.  Fine  kid  bits  by  Mickey  Mc-  Guire  and  Jackie  Searl.   SECOND  HAND  WIFE— Fox   "OUT  out  to  please  readers  of  Kathleen  Nor-  ■*-  ris,  originator  of  the  tale.  Helen  Vinson,  as  a  gold-digging  wife,  maneuvers  hubby  Ralph  Bellamy  into  the  arms  of  his  understanding  and  high-minded  stenographer,  Sally  Eilers —  and  so  on.  Karol  Kay  plays  a  lovely  daughter  to  Helen,  but  Director  Hamilton  MacFadden  forgot  that  Kathleen's  stuff,  which  always  reads  well,  needs  speeding  up  when  put  on  the  screen.   THE  VAMPIRE  BAT— Majestic  Pictures   TF  you  don't  know  "Dracula,"  "Franken-  •* stein, "  or  others  of  the  horror  genre,  you  can  see  "The  Vampire  Bat"  and  get  all  your  shud-  dering over  with  at  one  sitting.  That  is,  if  you  can  shudder  over  a  story  which  creaks  badly,  as  Lionel  Atwill,  Fay  Wray  and  Melvyn  Douglas  unfold  the  horrific  doings  of  a  sup-  posed vampire  at  work  in  a  German  village.  Well-directed  and  photographed.   LAUGHTER  IN  HELL— Universal   "COR  "another  chain  gang  picture,"  this  Jim  -*-  Tully  tale  works  out  somewhat  acceptably,  thanks  chiefly  to  Pat  O'Brien's  excellent  por-    Photoplay   is  first  always  with  latest  Hollywood   beauty  secrets.  Valuable  hints  for  you   every  month    trayal  of  Irish  temperament  shining  through  the  drawling  ways  of  rural  Georgia.  Marred  by  villains  and  situations  altogether  too  vil-  lainous to  be  convincing.  Good  detailed  work  by  Merna  Kennedy,  Berton  Churchill  .and  Douglas  Dumbrille;  Gloria  Stuart  provides  Pat's  happy  ending.  Will  do,  if  you  don't  mind  horror  laid  on  with  a  trowel.   SO  THIS  IS  AFRICA— Columbia   A LTHOUGH  this  is  undoubtedly  the  fun-  ■*  *-niest  effort  of  Wheeler  and  Woolsey's  screen  career,  it  is  so  crammed  with  risque  material  it  will  hardly  pass  censors  without  considerable  cutting.  As  animal  hunters  in  Africa,  the  two  comics  burlesque  every  animal  picture  pro-  duced, particularly  "Tarzan."  With  Raquel  Torres,  Esther  Muir  and  Henry  Armetta  as  foils,  they  contribute  an  evening  of  rowdy  en-  tertainment.   Strictly  stag  picture  as  it  stands.   MIDNIGHT  WARNING—  Mayfair  Pictures   A  HORROR  picture  at  its  worst.  Based  ■**■  on  the  old  story,  now  practically  a  legend  — where  the  girl  returns  to  her  hotel,  and  no  one  knows  her  or  has  ever  heard  of  her  mother,  with  whom  she  has  just  registered  (only  in  this  case,  it's  her  brother).  And  aren't  you  con-  fused? And  is  she  baffled?  And  aren't  we  all!  Good  cast,  including  Claudia  Dell,  William  Boyd  and  John  Harron,  does  what  it  can  to  be  convincing.   LUXURY  LINER— Paramount   A  STRONG  cast  struggles  hard  with  the  ■**•  inane  plot  and  silly  dialogue  of  this  one.  A  doctor,  following  his  eloping  wife  aboard  a  huge  liner,  finds  himself  and  the  story  lost  in  a  mass  of  unrelated  events.  Even  the  bit  of  comedy  that  is  literally  dragged  in  fails  to    by  Jay  Irving    "I  knew  your  dad  well."    Photoplay  Magazine  for  March,  1933    I25    help.  Cast  includes  George  Brent,  Zita  Jo-  hann.  Vivienne  Osborne,  Alice  White,  Verrce  Teasdale,  Frank  Morgan  and  C.  Aubrey  Smith.   WOMEN  WON'T  TELL— Chesterfield   A  N  abandoned  child  is  found  in  the  city  -**-dump  by  a  woman  junk  scavenger.  The  little  girl  grows  up  to  become  a  tennis  star,  and  falls  in  love.  The  mystery  surrounding  her  origin  almost  breaks  up  the  romance — and  you  know  the  rest.  There  are  courtroom-  prison  scenes  thrown  in  for  good  measure,  and  Sarah  Padden,  Gloria  Shea,  Otis  Harlan,  Mae  Busch  and  others  enact  the  drama.   HANDLE  WITH  CARE— Fox   ALTHOUGH  James  Dunn  and  screen-debu-  tante Boots  Mallory  are  billed  as  stars,  they  really  support  two  prankish  young  boys,  Buster  Phelps  and  George  Ernest.  After  some  ''Peck's  Bad  Boy"  stuff,  the  story  goes  mildly  dramatic  with  a  gangster  plot  against  Jimmie.  Thereupon,  the  boys  rally  all  the  youngsters  in  town  and  stage  a  Keystone  comedy  mob  rescue.  A  few  thin  glimpses  of  the  real  James  Dunn;  Boots,  given  nothing  worth  doing  by  the  script,  contributes  just  that.   SAILOR  BE  GOOD—RKO-Radio   JACK  OAKIE'S  back  in  the  navy  again,  this  time  as  a  gob  prize-fighter  with  a  yen  to  count  John  Barleycorn  out.  Vivienne  Osborne  very  appealing  as  his  taxi-dancer  true  love,  and  Gertrude  Michael  excellent  as  the  swell  society  dame  who  marries  him  for  a  thrill.  George  E.  Stone  wasted  in  a  silly  trainer  role.  Not  especially  recommended;  the  humor  is  strictly  of  the  barrel-house  type.   GAMBLING  SEX—Freuler  Film   A  N  unpretentious  little  picture  about  a  ■**-young  heiress  who  shoots  the  wad,  to  find  the  riches  of  true  love  after  she  goes  broke.  Ruth  Hall  is  teamed  with  Grant  Withers  as  the  once-rich  race-horse  trainer,  and  both  do  nicely;  John  Sainpolis,  as  the  sporty  father  who  gets  killed  by  the  outlaw  horse  his  daugh-  ter afterwards  rides,  helps  with  some  decent  acting.   DECEPTION— Columbia   A  NOBLE  young  innocent  (Nat  Pendleton)  steps  into  the  crooked-wrestling  racket  and  wipes  out  the  slick  promoter  (Leo  Carrillo)  and  his  mob.  The  action's  as  heavy-footed  as  the  dull-witted  behemoths  who  do  the  grap-  pling; Nat's  smile  is  as  fixed  as  the  matches.  Some  human  bits  contributed  by  Frank  Sher-  idan as  a  trainer,  Hans  Steinke  as  the  set-up  champ,  Dickie  Moore  and  Thelma  Todd.  Good  shots  of  various  grips  and  falls.   BACHELOR  MOTHER—   Goldsmith  Prod.   T~\ON'T  feel  badly  if  you  miss  this  one.  A  ■*— 'rich  young  roisterer  (James  Murray),  need-  ing an  aged  mother  to  placate  a  speed  court,  adopts  one  (Margaret  Seddon)  from  an  old  ladies'  home  run  by  Evalyn  Knapp.  Mama  shoots  the  designing  vamp  (Astrid  Allwyn)  when  she  threatens  James;  chastened,  he  mar-  ries Evalyn.  A  few  good  bits  immersed  in  a  welter  of  wooden  performances  and  mawkish  heart-throbs.   MALAY  NIGHTS— Mayfair  Pictures   JOHNNY  MACK  BROWN,  Raymond  Hat-  J  ton,  Ralph  Ince  and  Dorothy  Burgess  do  what  they  can  to  make  this  story  of  the  Malay  pearl  beds  palatable.  Also,  there  are  Carme-  lita  Geraghty  and  Lionel  Belmore  in  the  cast.  But  none  of  them  can  do  much  to  help.  The  trouble  is  that  there  just  isn't  any  story  to  do  anything  with.  And  what  story  there  is  gets  pretty  mellow  without  getting  anywhere  else.

Name    •  .  ti     Address     3-33    Cal  York's  Monthly  Broadcast  from  Hollywood    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  90  ]    /"\NE  of  the  quaintest  sights  the  old  village  ^of  Hollywood  has  ever  seen  is  Mr.  George  Arliss  out  for  that  much  publicized  five  mile  morning  walk.   Up  Cahuenga  Pass  the  sprightly  Mr.  Arliss  walks.  While  right  behind  him  and  follow-  ing slowly,  comes  the  Arliss  car  and  the  Arliss  chauffeur.   When  Mr.  Arliss  feels  slightly  tired  of  the  pavement  pounding,  he  motions  for  the  car,  hops  in  and  the  remaining  four  miles  of  the  morning  walk  is  made  in  the  Arliss  limousine.   A  ND  I  like  the  one  Irving  Berlin  ■**■ tells  of  his  experience  with  the  secretary  of  a  Los  Angeles  lawyer.   "Hello !"  said  Berlin  over  the  tele-  phone.    "This  is  Irving  Berlin."   There  was  a  pause  and  then  came  a  drawling,  sarcastic  reply:   "Say  It  Isn't  So!"   /^NNE  of  the  ex-designers  for  M-G-M,  now  ^->in  Paris,  was  walking  down  a  Paris  bou-  levard when  he  noted  a  familiar  looking  figure  ahead  of  him — walking  with  long,  determined    strides.  Mackintosh,  mannish  hat,  hands  in  pockets.   He  looked  at  her  feet.     Yes — it  was!   He  placed  his  hand  on  the  back  of  her  arm.  She  started  and  commenced  to  shake  like  a  woman  unexpectedly  attacked  by  bandits.   "But  please.  I  have  had  to  change  hotels  eight  times  now.    This  is  terrible — "   A  XD  then  this  man  who  had  known  Greta  ^Garbo  so  well  on  the  Metro  lot  in  Holly-  wood realized  that  this  "wanting  to  be  alone"  and  "unrecognized'1  had  become  a  real  com-  plex with  the  great  star.  The  way  she  shook  was  actual.  He  promised  not  to  reveal  the  fact  that  she  was  in  Paris.  And  he  didn't.  She  had  left  before  he  even  whispered  the  story.  Garbo  annoyed  the  English  immensely.  //  she  was  in  London  and  didn't  let  anyone  know!  Why,  she  had  friends  in  London.  The  English  don't  understand  this  kind  of  complex  in  world  celebrities.    A  LL  Hollywood  is  now  having  to  admit  Joan  Blondell  was  right.  Her  answer  in  reply  to  all  queries  relative    to  the  report  she  had  married  George  Barnes  last  summer  was  something  of  a  classic.   "I  didn't  say  we  were  married,"  she  asserted,  "and  I'm  not  saying  now  whether  we  are  or  we  aren't. "   And  then  she  and  George  confounded  all  the  guessers  by  getting  married  in  Phoenix,  Ariz.   TT  actually  happened.     At  a  recent  Hollywood  party,  a  certain  leading   man  took  a  little  beauty  out  on  the   veranda.    But  the  young  lady  refused   to   be   kissed   and   walked   into   the   house.   The  actor  hurried   after  her.   "Listen,"  he  said,  "don't  you  know   who  I  am?"   "TT'S  so  stupid,"  says  Billie  Burke  of  her  rumored  engagement  to  David  Burton.  "Mr.  Burton  is  an  old  friend.  He  put  on  'The  Marquise,'  in  New  York  and  again  for  me  here  and  in  San  Francisco.  These  rumors  so  soon  after  Mr.  Ziegfeld's  death  are  in  such  bad  taste."    WHEN  friends  heard  about  the  collec-  tion of  old  Western  mementoes  that  Mary  Pickford  gave  Douglas  Fair-  banks for  Christmas,  they  got  together  and  arranged  a  surprise  house-warming.   Mary  is  wearing  one  of  the  costumes  from  "Secrets,"   and   Doug  dug   up   his   treasured   126    "Mark  of  Zorro"  outfit.  Eetween  them  is  Mary's  niece,  Gwynne  Pickford,  and  behind  her,  dressed  as  a  sheriff,  the  dowager  Duchess  of  Sutherland,  Lady  Millicent  Hawes.  Beside  her  in  white  is  Mrs.  Johnny  Mack  Brown,  while  that  cheerful  cowboy  behind  the  girls  is  Joel  McCrea.       Behind   Doug  is  his  brother    Robert's  daughter,  Lucile,  and  next  to  her  John  Monk  Saunders,  with  "Big  Boy"  Williams  peeping  over  his  head.  The  old-timer  with  plug  hat  and  beard  is  Doug  Jr.,  as  a  Western  gambler.  Two  "hill  billy"  artists  provide  the  music.  The  relic  room  at  Pickfair  is  planned  as  the  nucleus  of  a  Western  museum'.    WATCH    FOR   THIS    GREAT    ARRAY  OF     RKO     RADIO    PICTU  RES  !

There  is  no  reason  why  he  should  even  consider  your  gums!   Yet  his  sauces,  his  entrees,  his  desserts,  give  your  gums  none  of  the  stimulation  they  need  for  healthy  hardness.  Your  gums  lead  a  lazy  life  indeed.  They  be-  come weak,  tender,  flabby.  One  day  you  discover  "pink  tooth  brush."   Any  good  dentist  will  explain:  "Go  on  eating  the  delicious  foods  of  today.  But  — you  must  care  for  your  gums!   "Modern  gums,"  he  will  tell  you,  "are  flabby,   touchy  gums  because   modern    foods  give  them  too  little  stimulation.  Most  people  tend  to  have  bleeding  gums  — a  condition  we  call  'pink  tooth  brush.'  Ignore  it,  and  you  may  find  yourself  with  gum  troubles  as  serious  as  gingivitis  or  Vincent's  disease  or  even  pyorrhea,  though  the  last  is  rare.  You  will  probably  find,  too,  that  your  teeth  look  dull  and  dingy.  And  sometimes  sound  teeth  are  threatened."   "Pink  Tooth  Brush"  can  be  checked  with  Ipana  and  Massage   Don't  let  "pink  tooth  brush"  go  on  and  on.  Get  some  Ipana  Tooth  Paste.    Clean  your  teeth  with  it  in  the  regular  way.  But  afterward,  put  a  little  more  Ipana  on  your  brush  or  finger-tip  and  lightly  massage  it  into  your  flabby  gums.   Your  teeth  will  feel  very  clean — and  within  a  few  days  they  will  begin  to  brighten  up.  Within  the  month  your  gums  will  have  become  firmer.  The  ziratol  in  Ipana,  together  with  the  mas-  sage, speeds  the  circulation  in  the  gum  cells  and  hardens  the  walls.   Get  Ipana  at  your  druggist's.  Use  Ipana  with  massage  and  not  only  will  your  teeth  be  whiter,  but  you'll  see  no  more  of  "pink  tooth  brush."

ITS   FUN  TO  BE  FOOLED   ...IT'S  MORE   FUN  TO  KNOW    Here's  a  trick  used  in  cigarette  advertising.  It  is  called  "Coolness."  EXPLANATION:  Coolness  is  deter-  mined by  the  speed  of  burning.  Fresh  cigarettes,  retaining  their  full  moisture,  burn  more  slowly  ...smoke  cooler.  Dried- out  ciga-  rettes taste  hot.    Camels  are  cooler  because  they  come  in  the  famous  air-tight  welded  Humidor  Pack  .  .  .  and  because  they  contain  better  tobaccos.  A  cigarette  blended  from  choice,  ripe  tobaccos  tastes  cooler  than  one  that  is  harsh  and  acrid.  For  coolness,  choose  a  fresh  cigarette,  made  from  costlier  tobaccos.   It  is  a  fact,  well  known  by  leaf  tobacco  experts,  that  Camels  are  made  from  finer,  MORE  EXPENSIVE  tobaccos  than  any  other  popular  brand.

PUSHES   A    BABY   CARRIAGE   Exercise — whether  you  get  it  at  sea  or  in  the  park  —  is  splendid!  But  gums  need  exercise,  too.  They  need  daily  care  with  Ipana  and  massage.    Neither  wealth    nor  Health    keeps  "Pink  Tooth  Brush"  away!    MILLIONAIRES  have  "pink  tooth  brush"  and  stevedores  have  it.  The  debutante  is  no  more  immune  to  its  threat  than  the  shop  girl — the  wealthy  dowager  no  more  than  the  scrubwoman.  For  "pink  tooth  brush"  is  a  condition  of  the  gums  brought  about  by  the  soft  foods  of  our  20th  century  menus.   Like  every  other  living  tissue,  your  gums  need  exercise.  The  vigorous  chewing  of  hard  foods  once  supplied  the  stimulation  they  need  so  vitally.  But  the  soft  foods  of  our    modern    menus — entrees,    puddings,    Ipana   TOOTH  PASTE   A  Good  Tooth  Paste,  like  a  Good  Dentist,  is  never  a  luxury    creamy  sauces,  give  them  no  stimulation  — leave  them  dormant,  soft  and  flabby.   Naturally,  they  become  sensitive  and  tender — develop  a  tendency  to  bleed.  Nat-  urally, some  morning  that  "tinge  of  pink"  shows  up  on  your  tooth  brush.   And  "pink  tooth  brush"  is  serious.  Ignored,  it  may  lead  to  gingivitis,  to  Vincent's  disease,  or  to  the  much  more  dreaded  but  fortunately  rarer  pyorrhea.  It's  serious  because  it  may  even  endanger  sound  teeth.   Do  something  about  "pink  tooth  brush."    Today — get  a  tube  or  two  of  Ipana  Tooth  Paste.  (Ipana  is  first  of  all  a  splendid  mod-  ern tooth  paste  that  really  cleans  the  teeth,  yet  can't  possibly  harm  the  delicate  enamel.)   Now — each  time  you  clean  your  teeth —  rub  a  little  extra  Ipana  into  your  gums.   Ipana  contains  an  effective  toning  agent  known  as  ziratol.  This,  with  the  daily  massage,  will  bring  your  gums  back  to  a  healthy  condition.  Slack  circulation  is  speeded  up — the  gum  walls  recover  the  firmness  they  had  when  you  were  a  child —  and  you  forget  about  "pink  tooth  brush"!

Good  entertain-  ment.    (Feb.)   EVENINGS  FOR  SALE— Paramount.— Sparkle,  artistry  and  romance  stud  this  story  of  post-war  Viennese  society.  There  are  Mary  Boland,  the  senti-  mental American  millionairess,  Herbert  Marshall,  the  pauperized  nobleman,  charming  Sari  Maritza,  and  a  very  sober  Charlie  Ruggles.     (Jan.)    EXPOSED — Eagle  Prod. — The  honest  hero  turns  "stool"  to  trap  a  gang.  Follow  the  moss-grown  lovers'  misunderstandings.  Too  much  for  Barbara  Kent  and  William  Collier,  Jr.     (Dec.)   FACE  IN  THE  SKY,  THE— Fox.— A  good  cast  with  Spencer  Tracy  and  Marian  Nixon  can't  make  this  a  good  picture.      (March)   FAITHLESS— M-G-M— Tallulah  Bankhead rates  cheers  as  an  heiress  in  love  with  struggling  Robert  Montgomery.  Crash!  "Primroses"  for  Tallulah,  skids  for  Bob.

FALSE  FACES— World  Wide.— Startling,  with  a  brand-new  idea — an  expose  of  malpractice  in  "face  lifting."

(Dec.)   •  FAREWELL  TO  ARMS,  A— Paramount. —  Helen  Hayes,  Gary  Cooper  and  Director  Frank  Borzage  turn  the  Hemingway  novel  of  the  poignantly  beautiful  love  affair  between  the  lieutenant  and  the  nurse  into  a  triumph  of  screen  artistry.

FIGHTING  GENTLEMAN,  THE— Freuler  Film.  — Fast  moving  but  trite.  Good  prize  ring  scenes  with  ex-champ  Jim  Jeffries  as  referee.

(Feb.)   •  FLESH— M-G-M.— Wally  Beery  tries  wrest-  ling this  time  and  almost  achieves  another  "Champ."  Poor  dumb  Wally,  as  a  beer-garden  waiter-grappler,  is  crossed  by  his  wife  (Karen  Morley)  and  her  lover  (Ricardo  Cortez).  Splendidly  done.  (Feb.)   FORTY-NINERS,  THE— Freuler  Film.— Looks  like  reassembled  stock  film  shot  when  "The  Covered  Wagon"  was  screened.  Bustling,  but  not  thrilling.  (Feb.)   42ND  STREET — Warners. — Almost  an  out-and-  out  musical,  in  which  Ruby  Keeler  jumps  from  chorus  to  fame  in  a  big  way — in  the  story  and  as  an  actress.  (March)   FOURTH  HORSEMAN,  THE— Universal. —  Take  the  children  to  Tom  Mix's  best  in  an  age.  Little  dialogue  but  packed  with  thrilling  action.  (Dec.)

(March)   GUILTY  OR  NOT  GUILTY— Monogram.—  Melodrama  that  becomes  comedy  unintentionally.

It  does  seem  only  fair,  seeing  how  Nils  Asther  has  set  folks  raving  by  his  performance  in  "The  Bitter  Tea  of  General  Yen,"  that  we  remind  you  what  this  son  of  the  Vikings  looks  like  when  he  comes  out  of  disguise.  So  here  he  is,  as  he  is  when  enjoying  himself  in  true  Norseman  style    $25  LETTER   I  cannot  understand  the  aversion  displayed  by  so  many  stars  for  being  "typed."  Aren't  we  all — types?  Butcher,  baker,  banker,  broker;  milliner,  manicurist,  modiste,  mother — don't  we,  each  of  us,  play  the  same  old  role  over  and  over,  day  after  day?   We  don't  expect  our  banker  to  turn  suddenly  into  the  iceman  or  our  postman  into  the  min-  ister. Is  it  any  wonder  we  experience  a  feeling  of  disappointment,  amounting  almost  to  out-  rage, when,  after  looking  forward  for  days  to  the  appearance  of  a  favorite  in  a  new  picture,  we  arrive  at  the  theater  all  set  to  share  for  an  hour  or  two  the  joys  and  sorrows  of  a  "screen  pal,"  and  discover  that  the  object  of  our  de-  votion has  undergone  a  complete  change —  sometimes  even  to  an  acquired  accent?   Mabel  Argo,  New  Albany,  Ind.   $10  LETTER   Living  in  faraway  China,  the  only  glimpse  I  get  of  my  homeland  is  through  the  movies.  I  know  I  will  never  see  America  with  my  own  eyes  again.  I  have  an  invalid  husband  who  cannot  move  from  his  bed,  and  I  look  after  him  and  earn  money  to  send  my  little  girl  to  school.   8    THERE  can  be  no  question — Nils  Asther  did  himself  and  his  future  plenty  of  good  with  his  performance  in  "The  Bitter  Tea  of  General  Yen."  After  weighing  him  against  Gable,  Cooper,  Raft,  March  and  others,  many  a  reader  casts  his  (or  her)  vote  for  Nils.   Fredric  March  attracted  a  lot  of  attention  during  the  past  month,  while  Muni's  "Fugitive"  is  still  drawing  widespread  praise,  and  Lee  Tracy  is  coming  stronger  and  stronger.   Norma  Shearer  continues  to  re-  ceive compliments  for  her  work  in  "Strange  Interlude"  and  "Smilin'  Through" — but  Helen  Hayes  and  Gary  Cooper's  "A  Farewell  to  Arms"  have  now  pulled  neck  to  neck  for  first  honors.  Clara  Bow  and  Kath-  arine Hepburn  perhaps  come  next  in  volume  of  comment  while  Helen  Vinson's  "Lawyer  Man"  drew  in-  creasing notice.   Signs  point  likewise  to  paeans  of  praise  for  Clive  Brook  and  Diana  Wynyard  as  "Cavalcade"  gets  more  about  the  country,  and  the  Barry-  more  opus  about  Rasputin  is  seen.    People  up  here  argue  and  try  to  put  me  off  the  idea  of  sending  my  little  girl  to  America.  Depression,  they  say.  No  jobs,  no  food,  no  clothes,  no  money.    America  is  doomed.   But  I  know  America  will  win  through.  When-  ever I  go  to  the  movies,  I  marvel  at  the  courage  that  enables  the  American  people  to  go  on  fighting,  producing  good  entertainment,  chang-  ing tears  to  smiles.  Helping  people  like  myself  to  retain  hope  for  better  things.   That  is  why  I  am  going  to  send  my  daughter  to  America.  I  have  faith  in  America.  The  movies  have  helped  me  see  it!   Aline  S.  Allen,  Shanghai,  China   $5  LETTER   I  suppose  I  have  only  myself  to  blame  be-  cause my  eighteen  year  old  daughter  is  so  shy  and  ill  at  ease  in  the  presence  of  boys.  In  my  anxiety  to  prevent  her  from  becoming  too  bold,  I  took  the  utmost  caution  in  raising  her.  Among  other  things  I  saw  to  it  that  she  at-  tended the  movies  very  seldom  (supposing  that  they  might  have  a  bad  influence  on  her).   In  several  recent  pictures  I  had  occasion  to  admire  the  beautiful  naturalness  with  which  the  young  girls  talked  and  laughed  with  the  men  .  .  .  and  I  had  an  inspiration.  I  encour-  aged my  daughter  to  attend  the  movies  and  with  great  care  and  subtlety,  called  her  atten-  tion to  the  natural  actions  of  the  boys  and  girls  together.  I  am  delighted  these  days  when  I  hear  my  daughter  say  words  like  "  thank  you,  flatterer,"  instead  of  blushing  miserably.   Mrs.  E.  Miller,  St.  Louis,  Mo.   WELL!   NILS  SEEMS  HOT!   I  admire  the  smooth,  subtle  acting  of  Leslie  Howard,  the  animal  appeal  of  Clark  Gable  and  the  sophistication  of  Herbert  Marshall.  But  there  is  some  indefinable  quality  lacking  in  each  one  of  these  romantic  men.  I  had  de-  spaired of  ever  finding  my  perfect  specimen  of  screen  man-hood — until  I  saw  "The  Bitter  Tea  of  General  Yen"  and  Nils  Asther!   Lucille  S.  Adams,  Birmingham,  Ala.   How  can  women  rave  about  Clark  Gable  and  George  Raft  when  Nils  Asther  has  returned  to  the  screen?   Asther  was  superb  as  General  Yen,  dominat-  ing even  as  competent  an  actress  as  Barbara  Stanwyck.  He  is  easily,  in  my  opinion,  the  handsomest  man  who  has  ever  appeared  in  pictures.  His  physique  compares  favorably  even  with  Weissmuller's.  He  dwarfs  Raft  to  such  insignificance  that  I  shan't  stop  to  con-  trast them.   As  for  the  Gable  "menace" — Asther  has  it  in  a  more  subtle  way.  He  is  cruel  where  Gable  is  merely  brutal,  with  crude  masculine  virility.  Alice  Simpson,  Seattle,  Wash.   MARLENE!    WHAT  YOU  STARTED!   I  wish  to  laud  Marlene  Dietrich,  Katharine  Hepburn  and  Greta  Garbo  for  their  courage  in  not  carrying  their  screen  appearances  into  private  life.   The  trousers  worn  outside  of  work  by  Dietrich  and  Hepburn  are  as  comfortable,  not  to  say  as  charming  and  logical,  as  the  drapes  with  which  they  are  gowned  for  the  public  eye.  If  young  girls  and  women  who  fallow  the  styles  (figuratively,  but  sadly)  of  the  best  dressed  actresses,  will  observe  the  simple,  sensible  togs  these  three  personalities  wear,  they  will  be  saved  many  a  pang  of  hopeless  envy.

He  snarled  at  patriotism,  hated  his  officers  and  the  men  around  him.  He  despised  the  army  and  refused  to  bow  to  discipline.  He  was  cocky  and  quick-tempered.  He  wanted  to  fight  every-  body but  the  enemy.

From  all  signs,  Mae  West's  "She  Done  Him  Wrong"  is  going  to  launch  many  an  argument — virtue  vs.  fun — during  the  season.  For  example,  what's  your  idea  of  the  work  she's  putting  on  Cary  Grant?    It  seems  that  the  public  is  falling  for  this  Dietrich  male  attire  fad.  Most  of  the  smart  women's  shops  here  are  featuring  suits  with  trousers  as  well  as  skirts.  But  need  it  be  that  men's  garters  and  suspenders  sing  the  ac-  companiment?   It  must  be  remembered  that  Marlene  Dietrich  is  an  actress — always  dramatizing  herself,  striving  for  something  new  and  out-  standing. The  average  woman  has  no  excuse  for  this.   Jack  Henry,  Hollywood,  Calif.   Marlene  should  be  sued  for  disrupting  home  life,  parading  in  masculine  attire!  Will  Pop  foam  at  the  mouth  when  he  tries  to  get  into  a  strange  pair  of  pants  in  his  closet?   I  won't  be  able  to  tell  the  boy  friend  from  my  old  maid  aunt,  who  insists  upon  "Mar-  legging"  in  her  latest  "Dashabout,  Dandy,"  which  comes,  mind  you,  with  an  extra  pair  of  trousers!   Berxice  C.  Bowxe,  San  Francisco,  Calif.   You  may  think  I'm  mad — but  I'd  love  to  see  Marlene  Dietrich  with  Chevalier!  And  would  that  be  a  big  box-office  draw!

Will  you  please  page  the  High  Potentate  of  RKO-Radio  and  extend  to  him  my  vote  of  thanks  for  at  last  giving  one  of  the  screen's  most  talented  actresses,  a  long  deserved  break?   I  refer  to  Ann  Harding  and  her  superb  pcr-    No  wonder  our  readers  are  still  voicing  appreciation  of  Wallace  Beery's  work  in  "Flesh" — when  you  sense  the  gripping  spirit  of  the  piece,  as  shown  here.  Isn't  Wal-  lace just  the  trusting  palooka  Pcli-  kai  was — and  Karen  Morley  haunted,  exactly  as  she  should  be?    formancc    in    that    splendid    picture,    "The  Animal  Kingdom."   A  finer  team  of  artists  isn't  to  be  found  in  all  Hollywood  than  Ann  Harding  and  Leslie  Howard.  Artists  of  the  same  calibre,  their  combined  efforts  produce  pictures  that  will  long  be  remembered.   Hazel  D.  Behr,  Ft.  Wayne,  Ind.   Leslie  Howard  amazes  us  more  in  every  movie  he  is  in!  No  two  movies  could  be  more  unlike  than  "Smilin'  Through"  and  "The  Animal  Kingdom,"  yet  Mr.  Howard  turns  in  A-l  performances  in  both.  Who  says  he  isn't  the  most  versatile  on  the  screen?   Myrna  Loy  should  certainly  come  in  for  a  large  part  of  the  honors,  for  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  it  is  Leslie  Howard's  and  Ann  Hard-  ing's picture,  she  made  her  part  stand  out.  Boemoxt  Moss,  Newport,  R.  I.   I  have  just  seen  Ann  Harding  in  "The  Ani-  mal Kingdom"  and  feel  she  is  the  real  aristo-  crat of  stage  and  screen.   Dorothy  Alber,  Indianapolis,  Ind.   WHY,  GRANDPA!   Am  I  laughing  and  am  I  cheering!  I've  just  seen  Mae  West  in  "She  Done  Him  Wrong."  She's  something  rare,  so  heaven  preserve  her —  rarities  are  so  few  nowadays  in  the  movies.   While  I  was  gazing  upon  Mae's  buxom  curves,  some  woman  sitting  in  back  of  me  said  to  her  neighbor,  "Why  that's  positively  in-  decent!" I  turned  around  and  gave  her  the  meanest  look  I  could  muster.  My  granddaddy  said  that  scenes  like  those  in  Mae's  picture  were  absolutely  true  to  life,  and  I  guess  he  should  know.   After  watching  our  Garbo-Dietrich-Bank-  head  menaces  slither  through  this  and  that,  Mae  is  positively,  naughtily  refreshing.   Anita  Cahoon,  Huntington  Park,  Calif.   "FAREWELL  TO  ARMS"   When  T  went  to  see  Helen  Hayes  and  Gary  Cooper  in  "A  Farewell  to  Arms,"  I  was  pre-  pared to  behold  something  fine.   But  I  didn't  see  a  motion  picture,  for  I  really  met  two  people — a  young  army  officer  and  a  war  nurse,  who  loved  each  other  madly.   And  my  cheeks  were  wet  with  tears  when  I  beheld  the  soldier,  pitifully,  numbly,  in  his  tragic  sorrow,  hold  the  nurse  closely  in  his  arms,  while  she  slipped  away  to  "peace."   Yes,  I  must  have  really  met  these  people,  and  I  saw  the  woman  die,  after  I,  too,  had  learned  to  love  her.   Such  realism  is  art!  Can't  we  meet  more  real  people  in  the  movies?   Motes  Dille,  Kansas  City,  Mo.   I  would  like  to  tell  you  what  that  beautiful  picture,  "A  Farewell  to  Arms"  did  for  me.  My  husband  and  I  have  been  married  for  nearly  two  years,  but  lately  we  have  come  to  quarrel.  Finally  last  Sunday  we  went  to  see  "Farewell  to  Arms."   Before  the  picture  was  half  over  it  had  brought  back  to  me  the  vivid  memory  of  our  own  whirlwind  courtship  and  the  great  love  we  had  known.  Towards  the  end  of  the  picture,  when  my  undemonstrative  husband's  hand  crept  over  to  hold  mine,  I  knew  that  he  was  as  ashamed  as  I  of  what  we  had  been  doing  to  our  love.  That  heartrending  death  scene  made  us  both  realize  what  a  dreadful  thing  the  other's  death  would  be.   I  wish  I  could  personally  thank  all  those  who  made  "A  Farewell  to  Arms"  for  their  [  please  turn  to  page  12  ]    10    Photoplay  Magazine  for  April,  1933    II    RED. ROUGH  HANDS    move  mtoom,    IN    ONLY  3   DAYS!    I    Her  new  friends  were  wild  with  envy!  Her  gorgeous  frock  ...her  beautifully  coiffured  hair... she  outshone  them  all!   Then  they  saw  her  hands — coarse,  red,  rough  .  .  .  They  breathed  easily  again.  No  danger  of  anyone  falling  for  a  girl  with  those  hands!   Are  you  killing  the  charm  of  your  lovely  frocks,  the  allure  of  your  beauty,  with  rough,  red,  ugly  hands?   Would  you  continue  to,  if  you  knew  that  only  3  days  of  Hinds  care  would  make  your  hands  tenderly  soft,  white,  lovely?  The  kind  of  hands  men  adore  .  .  .    How  this  famous  cream  tvorks   Hot  water  .  .  .  harsh  cleansers  .  .  .  housework  ...  all  take  away  the  natural  oils  that  keep  hands  soft.  Hinds  Cream  puts  back  these  precious  oils.  And  thus  restores  youthful  softness  and  smoothness.   The  moment  you  rub  this  dainty,  gossamer- fine  cream  into  your  hands  you  feel  the  skin  become  soft  and  supple  again.   Unlike  ordinary  hand  lotions   Observe  how  different  Hinds  is  from  other  hand  lotions.  It  is  not  weak  and  thinned  out,  nor  is  it  one  of  these  thick,  gummy  jellies  that  just  stay  on  the  top  of  the  skin.  Hinds  is  so  chiffon-fine,  so  penetrating,  that  it  goes  deep  down  through  the  skin  layers  where  the  real  healing  work  must  be  done.   Use  Hinds  always  after  hands  have  been  in  water,  after  exposure,  and  before  going  to  bed  at  night.   This  famous  lotion  leaves  an  invisible  "second  skin",  too,  that  protects  hands  from  chapping  and  drying,  keeps  them  lovely  in  all  kinds  of  weather.  This  "second  skin"  is  a  fine  layer  of  Hinds  Cream  that  has  penetrated  deeply  through  the  rough  skin.  There  it  stays,  softening,  whitening,  protecting.

All  the  profits  of  the  Assistance  League  restaurant  are  donated  to  charity.   Above  we  see  Patsy  Ruth  Wilier  serving  Gwili  Andre,  Billie  Dove  and  her  sister-in-law  Mrs.  Charles  Bohny.    A  happy  luncheon  party,  indeed.     And  they  might  well  be  pleased,  for  the  salad  before  them  certainly  looks  inviting.     It  is  one  of  the  specialties  here.   Tomato  Aspic  with  Deviled  Eggs  and  Anchovy   Method:  Boil  together  one  can  of  tomato  juice,  two  stalks  of  celery,  one  small  onion  and  a  bay  leaf.  Strain,  and  add  one  package  of  lemon  Jello.  Fill  ring  molds  and  place  in  refrigerator  to  chill.  Hard  boil  six  eggs.  Remove  yolks  and  mash  with  silver  fork.  Season  with  chopped  ripe  olives,  pimentoes,  may-  onnaise, lemon  juice,  Worcestershire  sauce,  salt  and  pepper,  and  a  pinch  of  mustard.  Place  aspic  rings  on  lettuce  leaves.  Chop  egg  whites  and  add  to  the  yolks.  Fill  the  aspic  rings  with  the  mixture.  Garnish  with  anchovies.  This  is  a  delightful  addition  to  any  luncheon  menu — decorative  as  well  as  delicious.

Now  add  half  a  cup  of  hot  water  and  a  quarter  tea-  spoonful  of  beef  extract.     Stir  and  strain  into  chicken  mixture.     When  this  is  cool,  stir  in  the  cream  that  has  been  whipped  to  a  froth.    Put  this  in  a  large  border  mold  and  stand  in  refrigerator  for  about  two  hours.  When  ready  to  serve,  cover  a  flat  dish  with  crisp  lettuce  leaves.    Dip  mold  quickly  into  pan  of  hot  water;  loosen  salad  from  edge  and  turn  out  on  lettuce  leaves.    Have  the  celery  cut  and  fringed.    Mix  it  with  a  half  pint  of  mayonnaise  dressing  and  heap  in  center  of  the  mold.

It  isn't  fair,  because  men  are  really  the  worst  offenders.  Why  don't  you  quit  picking  on  the  women  and  write  a  few  ads  that  will  urge  men  to  be  more  fastidious  about  their  breath?"   When  these  requests,  coming  from  dancing  teachers,  cashiers,  club  wom-  en and  housewives,  began  to  get  over  the  thousand  mark,  we  thought  it  about  time  to  do  something  about  it.  Tliis  advertisement  is  the  result.   How's  your  breath  today?   Whether  it  is  because  men  are  too  busy  to  take  proper  care  of  their  mouth  and  teeth,  or  because  they  smoke  more  than  women,  or  eat  and    drink  unwisely,  the  fact  remains  that  men  are  the  worst  offenders  when  it  comes  to  halitosis  (unpleasant  breath).   Your  common  sense  tells  you  that  halitosis  is  the  unforgivable  fault  in  the  business  or  social  world.  It  is  un-  forgivable because  it  is  inexcusable.   The  one  way  to  make  sure  that  your  breath  is  beyond  reproach  is  to  gargle  with    Listerine    every    morning    and    night,  and  between  times  before  meet-  ing others.  Don't  waste  your  time  and  effort  on  questionable  mouth  washes  with  little  or  no  deodorant  effect.  Tests  show  that  Listerine  instantly  conquers  mouth  odors  that  ordinary  antiseptics  cannot  hide  in  12  hours.  It  attacks  the  source  of  odors  (fer-  mentation of  tiny  food  particles  in  the  mouth)  and  destroys  the  odors  them-  selves. Lambert  Pharmacol  Company.

The  former  describes  his  prize  winning  performance  in  "Dr.  Jekyll  and  Mr.  Hyde."  The  latter  sym-  bolizes  his  work,  his  character,  and  his  latest  scheduled  picture  with  Gary  Cooper,  "The  Eagle  and  the  Hawk,"  two  birds  that  flew  high    never  appeared  in  a  talking  picture,  but  that  he  once  was  a  talking  picture  himself.   "About  1907,"  Kruger  says,  "I  organized  nine  companies  of  actors.  We  used  to  stand  behind  the  screen  in  the  crude  motion  picture  theaters  of  those  days  and  speak  lines  while  the  film  was  being  shown.  It  was  a  sensation  for  a  short  time — the  first  talking  pictures  in  history."   IN  a  white  frame  house  in  Hollywood  the  Assistance  League  has  its  headquarters.  This  is  the  pet  charity  organization  of  the  town,  where  Los  Angeles  society  and  the  moving  picture  colony  work  together  for  the  assistance  of  women  who  have  to  support  themselves.   From  four  to  five  hundred  families  a  month  are  pro-  vided with  rent,  gas,  food,  and  medical  care  by  the  organization,  which  derives  its  income  from  various  activities.   There  is  a  tea  room  where  the  services  of  the  waitresses  are  donated.  There  you  may  be  handed  your  sandwich  and  soup  by  a  famous  picture  star  or  a  Los  Angeles  debutante.   NOTED  names  from  the  picture  colony  bring  crowds  to  the  tea  room  on  special  days.  To  date  Walt  Disney,  Ina  Claire,  Mary  Pickford  and  Norma  Shearer  have  drawn  the  biggest  houses.   Walt  Disney,  autographing  pictures  of  Mickey  Mouse,  brought  in  not  only  the  public  but  film  executives  themselves  who  wanted  these  souvenirs  of  Hollywood's  most  famous  picture  actor.  Ina  Claire  had  people  lined  up  on  the  sidewalk  for  places  in  the  tea  room  the  day  she  appeared.   THE  League's  home  is  situated  near  the  studio  of  one  of  the  picture  companies  and  it  is  no  uncom-  mon thing  to  see  actors  and  actresses  in  make-up  and  costume  in  the  shop  or  tea  room.   Ralph  Morgan  of  "Strange  Interlude"  fame  wrote  in  the  League's  guest  book  the  day  he  was  invited  to  lunch,  "This  is  the  greatest  honor  I  have  had  since  coming  to  Hollywood."   Lucile  Gleason,  the  pleasantly  plump  wife  of  Jimmy  and  mother  of  Russell,  testified  to  the  cook's  genius  when  she  wrote  in  the  same  book  on  a  like  occasion,  "To  H— with  the  diet."   A  YOUNG  man  stood  in  the  forecourt  of  Grau-  man's  Chinese  Theater,  during  the  intermission,  whom  even  Jack  Warner  would  have  sworn  was  his  own  reformed  bad  boy,  Jimmy  Cagney — in  the  flesh.   To  make  it  better,  Mrs.  Jimmy  Cagney  was  with  him.  He  stood  in  a  conspicuous  spot — which  was  unlike  Jimmy — wearing  an  impish  grin,  and  cheerfully  signing  all  the  autograph  books  presented.   Jimmy,  out  at  Warners,  was  asked  how  he  liked  the  picture.   "My  brother  saw  it  last  night — he  says  it's  swell.  I  was  home  tearing  off  yards  and  yards  of  first-class  shut-eye."   2A    It  certainly  is  a  good  trick,  if  you  can  do  it.  All  that's  necessary  is  a  brother  who  is  a  ringer  for  you.   THE  other  day,  a  cameraman  at  Universal  studios  stood  behind  Slim  Summerville  at  the  cashier's  desk  in  the  dining  room.   "Want  to  pay  my  bill,"  Slim  said.  "How  much  is  it?"   "One  hundred  dollars,  Mr.  Summerville,"  she  replied.   Slim  paid  without  a  word.   "Say,"  the  cameraman  said  in  surprise,  "How  long  do  you  let  your  bills  run?"   "Oh,  about  a  week,"  Slim  replied.   "And  you  eat  a  hundred  dollars  worth  of  lunches  in  a  week?"  the  astounded  cameraman  exclaimed.   "Well,  I'm  a  big  fellow,  you  know,"  Slim  grinned  and  went  out.    BUT  the  cameraman  wasn't  going  to  be  put  off  that  easily.  He  set  out  to  watch.  And  what  he  dis-  covered was  that  every  shabby  extra,  who  looked  as  though  he  were  half -starved,  was  met  with  a  "Hello,  buddy,  come  over  and  join  us.  I  need  company,"  from  Slim,  until  ten  or  fifteen  would  be  gathered  about  his  table.  And  made  to  feel  at  ease,  too,  as  though  they  were  doing  Slim  a  big  favor.   And  that  is  why  those  weekly  lunch  bills  of  Slim  Summerville's  run  up  to  one  hundred  dollars.   COMMENT  on  the  feminine  vogue  of  "masculine  attire"  is  stepping  off  on  the  wrong  foot,  it  seems  to  me.  Really,  pantaloons  and  tailored  coats  don't  necessarily  detract  from  femininity.  It's  the  way  they're  worn  that  matters.   The  Orient,  famous  through  the  ages  for  masculine  "superiority"  and  feminine  "inferiority,"  garbed  men  in  gowns  and  women  in  pajamas.  The  conventional  conception  of  an  Oriental  harem  is  an  assemblage  of  ladies  wearing  trousers;  with  blouse  and  pajamas  for  the  Chinese  beauties.   Yice  versa,  the  he-men  of  Scotland's  mountains  wore  kilts  (skirts),  and  some  still  do,  for  that  matter.   THE  girl  or  woman  with  a  discriminating  eye  to  her  own  figure  can  make  of  the  latest  mode  a  thing  to  increase  or  at  least  to  give  an  unexpected  piquancy  to  her  accustomed  charm.   But  masculine  attire,  -per  se,  is  not  intriguing  in  a  woman.  The  masculine  touch  should  enhance,  not  diminish,  the  feminine  line.   At  any  rate,  that  seems  to  be  the  consensus  of  opinion  of  male  experts  in  such  matters.   Dressing  is  really  a  fine  art  that  women  have  learned  to  perfect  over  many  centuries.  Nuances  in  taste  should  not  be  recklessly  abandoned  for  what  may  prove  to  be  only  a  passing  fad.  Adapt  what  is  best  of  the  new  mode  for  one's  best  appearance  is,  apparently,  the  safest  rule.  Kathryn  Dougherty.

"  What  is  it,"  they  ask  themselves,  "that  this  woman  has?"  The  Mona  Lisa  smiles  back,  pulling  them  toward  her  with  those  enigmatic  eyes,  exerting  that  compelling  fascination.  And  the  question  remains  unanswered.  A  mystery  woman,  enthralling  the  world  by  the  curious  bow  of  her  lips,  the  cryptic  knowledge  in  her  eyes!   There  have  always  been  mystery  women  in  the  world — from  the  Queen  of  Sheba  to  the  present  day.  Women  who  have  fascinated  by  some  elusive,  irresistible  charm.   Six  years  ago  Elinor  Glyn  started  IT,  and  passed  that  tag  on  to  Clara  Bow.  Clara  was  the  envy  of  every  girl  who  secretly  longed  for  that  same  magic  gift.  IT,  as  everyone  recalls,  was  feminine  allure  combined  with  radiating  energy — "pep."   You  couldn't  open  your  morning  newspaper  without  having  IT  pop  out  at  you  in  a  flurry  of  plump  limbs  and  disappearing  skirts;  crowns  of  frizzy  hair,  and  a  galaxy  of  baby  faces  and  "come-hither"  eyes.   Then  of  a  sudden,  people  began  saying  "scram"  to  pep-out-  of -season;  to  jazz  babies  and  boop-a-doop  girls.  IT  had  had  its  day.  Instinctively  the  world  sought  a  new  type  of  feminine  sorcery.  Something  less  primitive.  Something  less  obvious,  less  hilarious.  Something  to  steady  the  emotions,  not  to  jangle  them.    Yet,  withal,  something  to  fire  the  imagination.   LONG  before  the  petering  out  of  IT  girls,  and  all  they  stood  for,  Hollywood  producers  saw  the  handwriting  on  the  wall.  There  began  that  eternal  hunt  for  a  woman  who  would  be  "different"  from  all  other  women.   American  bathing  beauties  and  exotic  European  "finds"  filtered  into  Hollywood.  Bandwagons  gay  with  colors  and  high  with  extravagant  hopes  bearing  Cinderellas  who  were  soon  to  find  that  Hollywood  can  be  "The  City  of  Shattered  Dreams"  as  well  as  "The  Land  of  Heart's  Desire."   Then,  in  1926,  from  a  heap  of  trials  and  errors,  rose  Garbo   26    Women  of  the  ages — whose  charms  knew  neither  time  nor  race —  Cleopatra,  Lady  Hamilton,  Lillian  Russell,  Bernhardt,  Pavlowa    Thing  Called    By  Hilary  Lynn    Photomontage  by  Cushing-Klepser    Here  we  present  the  four  irresistible  women  of  today — Marlene  Dietrich,  Greta  Garbo,  Katharine  Hepburn  and  Joan  Crawford.  Each  has  that  elusive,  mysterious  power,  "X  "    27    These  have  charm  and  glamour,  but  not  "X"    Clara   Jean   Ann   Barbara   Mary   Helen   Bow   Harlow   Harding   Stanwyck   Pickford   Hayes   Diana  Wynyard    Norma  Shearer    Lupe  Velez    Constance  Bennett    Janet  Gaynor    Ruth  Chatterton    the  Magnificent.  In  a  rather  flamboyantly  unreal  picture,  "Flesh  and  the  Devil,"  she  gave  back  to  the  world  its  lost  dreams.  Poetry,  music,  chivalry  and  high-flung  romance,  were  all  called  to  life  by  her  astonishing  personality.   In  other  words — another  type  of  seductive  womanhood  was  granted  to  us  poor  humdrum  sinners.   Today,  the  world  asks  the  same  question  about  Greta  Garbo  that  it  does  about  the  Mona  Lisa.   "What  has  this  Garbo  got?"  inquires  a  breathless,  adoring  multitude.  But  Garbo  has  always  answered  them  merely  by  raising  her  hand  with  an  infinitely  slow  movement,  like  the  unfolding  of  a  flower.   An  unforgettable  gesture!   Garbo  was  never  seriously  mentioned  as  having  IT.  The  word  did  not  seem  to  become  the  mysterious  goddess.  Her  power  was  too  subtle,  too  elusive  to  connote  the  mere  obvious-  ness of  physical  charm.   No,  Garbo  was  something  different — as  different  from  other  women  as  da  Vinci's  painting  of  the  Mona  Lisa  is  different  from  other  portraits.   Today,  however,  we  may  give  the  inimitable  Swede  a  classi-  fication.   Let  us  say  that  she  represents  "X."   Garbo  is  the  living  symbol  of  the  X-woman.  What  every  other  woman  longs  to  be.  What  every  man  longs  to  possess.  The  X-woman  who  imprisons  a  man  by  the  movement  of  her  hands  instead  of  by  the  dimples  in  her  knees.   X — the  quality  which  illumines  a  woman  until  she  appears  to  both  sexes  a  goddess  to  be  worshipped.  Heart's  desire.  Woman  of  the  heights.   X — the  new  personality  factor.  The  fourth  dimension  of  feminine  allure.   X — the  stuff  of  which  dreams  and  dream-women  are  made.   X — which  men  through  the  ages  have  been  willing  to  die  for.   X — a  million  charm-and-glamour  miles  removed  from  IT.   THOSE  flip  little  "pep"  girls,  always  rarin'  to  go — that  jazzy,  shrieky,  let's-climb-a-flagpole-at-midnight  variety  of  femi-  nine attraction — is  as  passe  today  as  whoopee  for  breakfast  or  cold  potatoes  for  tea.   But  don't  for  a  moment  delude  yourself  into  believing  that  the  X-woman  is  a  new  discovery,  or  merely  the  invention  of  a  Photoplay  writer.  She's  as  old  as  Eve  who  had  her  X-way  with  poor,  defenseless  Adam  in  the  Garden  of  Eden.    And  she's   8R    been  glimpsed  at  every  turn  down  the  long  corridor  of  the  ages.  Inspiring  men  to  starry  deeds  of  glory  for  the  favor  of  her  potent  smile.   Cleopatra,  Madame  du  Barry,  Lady  Hamilton,  Sarah  Bernhardt,  Eleanora  Duse,  Isadora  Duncan,  Lillian  Russell —  these  women  all  bore  the  fourth  dimensional  mark  of  this  great  enchantment.   X  is  a  quality  that  irresistibly  draws  nearly  all  other  human  beings  towards  its  possessor.  In  essence  it  is  sex.  Yet  it  is  above  sex.  Or  perhaps  it  is  sex  sublimated.  Men  will  do  and  die  for  an  X-woman  without  expectation  or  hope  of  reward.  The  X-quality  stirs  uneasily,  yet  calms  and  soothes,  like  the  sea  in  the  moonlight,  or  mountains  in  the  twilight.  X  seems  to  be  the  indefinable  thing  we  seek  and  long  for  in  other  mortals.  It  is  the  unnamed  desire  of  the  human  soul.   FEW  film  stars  today  are  stamped  with  this  nearly  divine  quality.   If  we  were  choosing  current  film  stars  who,  in  our  opinion,  possess  X,  we  could  think  of  only  four.  In  varying  degrees,  it  is  true  but,  unmistakably,  all,  we  think,  possess  "X."   These  four  are  Greta  Garbo,  Marlene  Dietrich,  Katharine  Hepburn  and  Joan  Crawford.   Now  X,  strangely  enough,  is  not  necessarily  something  with  which  a  woman  must  be  born.  Possibly  it  is  only  a  matter  of  slow  growth.   Yet  it  seems  to  be  acquirable.   Take  X's  greatest  exponent — Garbo.   Certainly  no  young  actress  seemed  to  have  less  X  than  Greta  when  she  first  made  pictures  in  Sweden.  She  seemed  just  a  nice  wholesome,  buxom  country  lass.  Yes,  we  said  buxom.  Milk-  maid variety.    Charming,  but  without  that  potent  lure.   Joan  Crawford  a  few  years  ago,  before  she  tried  her  wings  with  dramatic  roles,  was  nothing  more  than  a  glorified  IT  girl,  who  took  prizes  at  dance  halls!  She  had  what  it  takes — and  how.  But  where  was  that  fatal  fascination  which  inflames  the  imagination  as  well  as  the  senses?   Some  say  Joan's  X-quality  is  synthetic.  Not  the  genuine  article.  But  we're  for  her  whole-heartedly.  For  X — though  a  rare  quality,  and  difficult  to  acquire,  as  are  all  rare  things — can,  nevertheless,  be  developed  by  women  of  understanding  who  have  the  natural  endowments  which  must  enter  the  blending.

An  artist  like  me,  Jimmy  Durante,  with  my  artistic  temperament  and  everyting,  have  I  suffered  the  futility  of  the  whole  thing?  Am  I  boined  or  am  I  steamin'?     Haaaaaaah.   Here  I  am,  all  ready  for  New  York.  After  nineteen  months  in  Hollywood,  I'm  going  back  to  New  York,  see,  for  ten  long  weeks  to  play  in  a  New  York  show,  and  who  knows  it?  Who  cares  if  I,  with  my  poison-  ality,  goes  or  stays.  It's  the  jealousy  of  the  thing,  that's  what.  Jealousy  of  a  man  with  my  ability  and  facial  atonements.  Haaah,  the  tought  of  it  is  gall  bladder  and  wormwood  to  my  soul.    That's  what  it  is.   You  see,  the  time  gets  nearer  and  closer  to  me  goin',  and  everybody  didn't  say  nothin'  and  I  hung  around  and  waited  and,  finally,  I  says  to  myself,  "Jimmy,  maybe  with  you  being  a  great  star  and  everyting,  they're  kinda  waitin'  for  you  to  take  the  initiation.  Maybe  they  feel  it's  up  to  you  to  kinda  say  somepin,  see."   So  I  meets  Gary  Cooper  on  the  lot  and  walkin'  up  to  him  kinda  ingraciously,  so  as  to  make  him  feel  the  magnitude  of  it,  I  says,  "Gary,  what  do  you  say  you  give  a  little  farewell  party  for  me,  seein'  I'm  off  to  New  York  soon?"  And  he  looks  positively  deaf  and  dumb  struck.  Overcome  by  the  mag-  nanimity, see.  He  starts  savin'  somepin'  about  bein'  busy  and  I  hush  him  right  up.    Won't  let  him  talk.   "Of  course  I'm  busy,"  I  tells  him,  "but  what  is  life  without  makin'  a  few  sacrifices  for  friends?  Don't  let  the  tought  of  me  stop  you.  I'll  leave  the  details  to  you,  Gary,  and  any  vintages  you  prefer."  Was  that  tellin'  him?  And,  "Oh  yes,  Gary,"  I  tells  him,  "it's  okay  to  have  a  couple  of  countesses  and  tings.  There's  noting  big  feelin'  about  me,  when  it  comes  to  my  choice  of  guests."   The  next  day  I  meets  Marie  Dressier  in  the  dinin'  room  and  I  suggests  justa  small  party  in  my  honor,  seein'  I'm  goin'  away  and  everting.  "Listen,  Jimmy,"  she  says,  "I  can't  give  you  a  party,  but,  if  you'll  promise  me  that  you'll  really  go,  and  go    "They  sent  a  great  basket  of  flowers  to  my  dressing-room —  I  nearly  shed  tears  when  I  saw  the  bill. — Yes,  it  said  C.  O.  D."    soon  and  quietly,  I'll  poisonally  give  you  a  large  check.  What  do  you  say?"   What  do  I  say?  Me,  Jimmy  Durante,  a  star  of  the  greatest  magnitude.  Oh,  the  bitter  irony  of  it.  The  mortifyin'  seclusion  of  the  whole  episode.  The  heart  rendin'  futility  of  it  all.  What  did  I  say?  What  did  I  say?  I  said  "Yes"  and  grabbed  the  check  before  she  could  change  her  mind.  After  all,  Marie's  a  good  frien'  and  I  ain't  out  to  hurt  anyone's  feelins.   "Lissen,"  I  said  to  Norma  Shearer,  "a  few  of  the  big  shots  around  here  is  plannin'  farewell  parties  for  me,  seein'  I'm  going  to  New  York  for  ten  weeks,  and  I  always  liked  you,  Miss  Shearer,  always  said  you  were  a  nice  girl.  And,  just  because  you  married  a  motion  picture  executive,  don't  tink  I  hold  it  against  you.  We  all  do  funny  tings  and  don't  tink  it  makes  any  difference  to  me."   "Well,  Jimmy,"  she  said,  "that's  nice  of  you  and  we  might  have  a  few  in  at  my  bungalow  one  day."   "Oh,"  I  argued,  "the  bungalow's  too  palateral.

You  don't  say — well!  It  seems  that  we've  heard  that  one  before.  We've  been  hearing  it,  in  fact,  ever  since  they  were  married — long  before  they  were  married,  even.  You  re-  member that  Hollywood  had  them  secretly  married  in  Mexico  months  before  they  actually  did  slip  away  and  get  spliced  in  New  York;  but  that  was  on  the  level  then,  too.   Hollywood  knew  it — and  shouted  it  abroad  in  whispers.  So  Hollywood  would  naturally  know  all  about  the  impending  divorce.  That  is,  it  is  impending  if  it  hasn't  happened  al-  ready.    Anyway,  the  whispers  are  unrestrained.   That  recurrent  divorce  rumor  about  Joan  and  young  Doug  crops  up  just  about  as  often  as  the  gas  bill.  It  gathers  mo-  mentum every  time  somebody's  washlady  meets  somebody  else's  parlormaid  over  the  back  fence.  Recently  it  got  so  authentic  that  a  famous  columnist  sprang  it-  over  the  air,  even  though  he  hadn't  been  listening  at  the  keyhole  with  his  own  ear.  It  was  a  world  "scoop"  and  he  not  only  modestly  admitted  it  but  bragged  about  it.  Seems  the  gateman  at  the  studio  had  it  from  the  newsboy  on  the  corner,  and  he  got  it  straight  from  the  lady  who  dresses  Mickey  Mouse's  hair.  Mickey  got  it  in  confidence  from  a  waitress  at  the  Pink  Elephant,  and  she  in  her  turn  got  it  direct  from  the    All  these  years  you've  been   disappointing  the    gossips.

But—   It  wasn't  long  before  the  aforesaid  again  appeared  on  the  air  and  this  time  it  was  handsprings  he  sprang,  not  Crawford-  Fairbanks  rumors.  He  swallowed  once,  gulped  twice,  and  finally  said  that  his  previous  announcement  wasn't  so.  Perhaps  Joan  and  Doug  had  decided  not  to  get  the  divorce  just  then  on  purpose  to  spite  him,  he  excused.  Anyway,  he  had  been  mis-  informed; the  milkman  had  left  cottage  cheese  instead  of  ground  glass  that  day,  and  that  was  where  the  mistake  had  come  in.   Somebody  had  crossed  up  the  signals,  it  seemed,  and  the  ball  carrier  scored  a  touchdown  over  his  own  goal.  Anyhow,  the  columnist  got  a  nice  wire  of  thanks  from  Doug  Jr.   However,  where  there's  so  much  smoke  there  must  be  fire.   That's  an  old  proverb,  in  case  you  don't  happen  to  know,  and   even  Joan  and  Doug  haven't  any  right  to  make  a  fool  out  of   a  proverb.    So  they  may  get  that  divorce  after  all,  even  though   at  present  the  fire  is  probably  all  in   the  prop  department.     But  it  is  a   fire,    just    the    same,    like    Russian   rubles    are    money.      No    question   about    it — this    time    it's    straight.   Infallible  Hollywood  says  so.

In  other  words,  came  the  English  to  Hollywood!    Doesn't  every-  body?    TT  all  began  with  business.    Sound  business.    There  was  a  day,  not  so  far  back,  that  American  motion  picture  producers  and  American  movie  house  audiences  were  well  enough  satisfied  with  a  luscious  face,  an  expressive  pair  of  legs  and,  oh  well  .  .  .  why  mention  that?  Progress  was  made,  of  course,  but  even  up  to  the  advent  of  the  talkies,  actions  spoke  louder  than  subtitles.  But  when,  for  the  first  time,  that  blessed  stillness  was  broken  by  the  human  voice — it  was  suddenly  realized  that  the  day  of  pantomime  was  over;  and  that  all  was  not  well  with  the  voices  or  the  pronunciation  of  some  of  the  stars.  "Oh,  woe,  woe,"  lamented    [  please  turn  to  page  101  ]    Janet  Chooses  Her  Man    When  La  Gaynor  first  saw  Henry  Garat  in  a  film  she  knew  what  she  wanted    Janet  Gaynor  is  a  star  that  Henry  Garat  in-  tensely admires,  though,  except  in  pictures,  he  had  never  seen  her.  Then  came  his  amaz-  ing summons  to  Hollywood.     What  a  break!    IT  will  be  interesting  to  see  what  happens  to  our  wistful  little  Janet  Gaynor  in  the  coming  year.  For  Janet  is  now  to  have  a  new  leading  man;  a  man  of  her  own  choosing,  a  man  so  different  from  Charlie  Farrell  and  so  directly  opposite  in  temperament  to  Janet's  husband,  Lydell  Peck,  from  whom  she  recently  separated,  that  one  can  scarcely  accept  the  credibility  of  the  new  Gaynor-Garat  romantic  screen  team.   The  strange  part  of  it  all  is  that  Janet  has  never  met  her  new  choice  of  screen  lover.  Nor  has  the  dapper  Frenchman,  Henry    Garat,    newly    imported    by   Fox,  ever  laid  eyes  on  Janet.     Yet         D         T ,- .  .   they  both  wanted  each  other  as  co-         DV      V I  V  £  I II  I    Janet  also  felt  Garat's  personality  radiate  from  the  screen.  She  believes  he  can  best  complement  her  new  film  roles    workers  after  each  had  seen  the  other's  photograph.       He  is  scheduled  to  play  opposite  Janet  in  "Adorable."   It  was  really  almost  a  mail-order  "romance"  from  the  start.  Janet  looked — and  looked  again  at  Garat's  stills  when  he  played  in  an  English  film.  And  then  one  day  she  walked  into  the  front  office  of  the  Fox  Studio  and  told  them  that  was  the  man  she  wanted  for  "Adorable."   In  the  meantime,  Henry  Garat,  suave,  handsome  and  the  tenderest  type  of  lover,  saw  only  one  picture  of  Janet.  He,  too,  was  entranced  by  her  wistfulness.  It  was  the  only  film  Garat  had  ever  seen  in  which  Janet  Gaynor  played,  and  it  was,  '  according  to  critics,  not  one  of  her  best.  The  picture  was  "Tess  of  the  Storm  Country."  He  saw  it  in  Paris — an  Ameri-  can talkie  with  French  titles — and  succumbed  to  the  charm  of  her  voice.   So  Garat  was  amazed  and  not  a  little  thrilled  when  Fox  contacted  him  to  offer  him  a  role  opposite  little  Gaynor.  He  accepted  immediately  and  set  sail  for  these  shores  without  delay.   When  Henry  Garat  arrived  in  New  York  on  the  first  lap  of  his  journey  to  Hollywood,  someone  began  warning  Madame  Garat  of  the  dangers  of  Hollywood.   Madame  Garat,  a  cultured  English  woman  and  really  quite  as  pretty  as  many 'a  movie  star,  smiled  indulgently  and  said:   "I'm  not  afraid  of  losing  Henry  in  Hollywood.  You  see,  I've  been  trained  to  be  a  star's  wife  in  Paris.  There,  the  girls  simply  ignore  the  wife  and  follow  the  husband  from  the  theater  to  the  home.  They  camp  on  his  doorstep.  Once,  I  remember,  I  couldn't  get  one  of  them  to  move  from  the  stairs  so  I  could  go  up  to  my  own  apartment.  No,  they  were  waiting  for  Henry  and  they  were  not  at  all  embarrassed  by  my  presence.  I  didn't  matter  at  all.     I  was  only  his  wife."

The  name  of  that  picture  is  "As  You  Desire  Me."  And  one  answer  to  the  "Garbo  myth,"  and  one  reason  for  that  weird  and  powerful  hold  on  the  public  imagination  which  Garbo  has  maintained  for  these  many  years,  is  also  to  be  found  in  that  title.   For  the  great  Garbo  has  been,  and,  we  believe,  always  will  be  as  you  desire  her!  Therein  lies  her  greatness  and  her  power.  Therein  lies  a  definite  intimation  of  her  immortality  as  a  screen  personality.   In  a  curious  and  inexplicable  way,  Greta  Garbo  has  given  her  audiences  what  they  demanded.  Whatever  she  acts  in  a  picture  she  becomes,  so  to  speak,  "all  things  to  all  men" — and  to  all  women  also.   She  transports  them  to  heights  of  imaginative  thinking  in  a  way  that  no  other  screen  actress  has  ever  been  able  to  approxi-  mate— no,  not  even  Dietrich.   If  Garbo  had  substantiated  the  rumors  that  spread  through  the  country  at  the  time  of  her  departure  for  Sweden — if  Garbo  had  retired  from  the  screen  then — Garbo  would  easily  have  become  one  of  the  immortals.  Her  name  would  have  been  mentioned  in  the  same  breath  as  that  of  Bernhardt  and  Duse.  And  the  Garbo  myth  would  have  been  perpetuated  forever  and  aye.   For  that  incomparable  shadow  woman  of  the  shadow  stage  is  far  more  a  real  personality  to  her  adoring  public  than  the  strangely  silent  "woman  whom  nobody  knows."  It  is  that  phantom  Garbo  of  a  million  and  one  moods  who  has  held  a  vast  multitude  in  the  palm  of  her  hand.  It  is  the  memory  of  that  shadow  which  will  survive.   But  Garbo  has  signed  a  new  contract.  There  are  rumors  that  the  United  States  is  putting  difficulties  in  the  way  of  her  return   36    Can  the  popu-  larity that  the  world  is  eager-  ly curious  about  he  on  the  wane?

Apparently,  there's  no  doubt  in  the  mind  of  Metro  executives  that  the  "one  and  only  Garbo"  can  still  eclipse  all  rivals.   Of  late,  though,  annoying  little  rumors  have  reached  our  ears  as  to  Garbo's  ability  to  maintain  her  supremacy.  Say  some  doubters,  "Is  the  Garbo  rage  on  the  wane?"  "Can  either  Metro  or  Garbo  herself  hold  a  public  which  is  slipping  away  from  her?"  Others  look,  solemn  and  mumble  something  about  the  fickle-  ness of  the  public  and  "out  of  sight,  out  of  mind."   At  this  writing,  it's  true  that  Garbo  has  been  away  from  this  country  for  eight    But  note  how  she  here  returns  to  much  of  the  sweet  wistfulness  shown  in  her  earlier  roles,  in  such  scenes  as  this  with  Melvyn  Douglas  in  "As  You  Desire  Me"    The  slightly  weary,  completely  superior  Garbo,  who  understands  the  worship  that  men  give  her,  as  in  this  scene  with  Von  Stroheim  in  "As  You  Desire  Me"    months.  It  is  also  true  that  among  the  high  school  and  fresh-  men college  sets,  Garbo  is  perhaps  not  as  great  a  favorite  today  as,  say,  Joan  Crawford,  Jean  Harlow,  Clark  Gable,  Fredric  March.  That  in  the  rural  districts,  they  would  rather  see  a  picture  any  day  which  featured  Hoot  Gibson,  Bob  Steele  or  Rin-Tin-Tin,  Jr.   Of  course  they  would!    But  what  of  it?   Are  the  preferences  of  certain  small  isolated  groups — groups  which  have  been  so  conditioned  because  of  their  age  or  environ-  ment— are  these  to  be  regarded  as  indicative  of  the  end  of  Garbo's  reign?   It  would  be  as  illogical  to  say  that  Hoover  lost  in  the  last  presidential  campaign  because  three  college  faculties  and  four  farming  districts  solidly  voted  against  him.  But  we  know  that  these  minor  returns  had  no  effect  in  swinging  the  vote.  America  is  a  vast  country.  And  don't  forget,  the  rest  of  the  world  is  vaster  still.   Doesn't  it  seem  reasonable  to  believe,  then,  that  the  Garbo  rage,  although  at  the  moment  slumbering,  because  of  the  absence  of  the  one  human  being  who  can  fan  it  into  flame  again  — will  be  rekindled  when,  as,  and  if  Garbo  so  desires?   We  might  even  be  tempted  to  assail  those  critics  who  use  as  their  main  defense  that  old  saying  "Out  of  sight,  out  of  mind,"  with  a  completely  contradictory  but  just  as  logical  proverb,  "Absence  makes  the  heart  grow  fonder."   Just  to  prove  that  Garbo  is  still  as  you  desire  her,  let  us  glance  back  at  some  of  her  earlier  pictures.   In  her  first  really  important  film,  "Flesh  and  the  Devil,"  in  which  she  conquered  the  heart  of     [  please  turn  to  page  98  ]   37    IF  youve  wondered  about   DIANA-    She's  twenty-six,  not  married,  and  is  as  intriguing  off  the   screen  as   on    By  Doris  Craig    moment  that,  in  all  our  lives,  I'm  sure,  none  of  us  shall  ever  forget.  She  was  speaking.  Quietly  at  first,  but  every  word  coming  straight  from  the  anguished  heart  of  a  mother.  Pleading  against  the  war  that  again  seemed  inevitable.   "You  tear  our  sons  from  our  arms,"  she  said,  "and  when  they  are  gone,  you  pin  a  medal  on  our  breasts.  To  take  the  place  of  the  boy  we  have  lost.  Gold  star  mothers.  After  the  last  war  that  was  to  end  all  wars,  you  herded  them  all  together,  these  gold  star  mothers,  on  a  ship.  You  dumped  them  down  on  a  cold,  barren  field  of  France,  covered  with  crosses,  and  said,  'Woman,  behold  thy  son.'  "    I    The  first  thing  most  people  wonder  on  meeting  Diana  Wynyard  is,  how  old  is  she?  Vividly  attractive,  she  has  both  youth  and  maturity  with  a  warmth  of  manner  utterly  unimpaired  by  British  reserve    YES,  merely  by  pushing  open  the  rough,  heavy  door  of  a  huge  sound  stage  on  the  M-G-M  lot,  I  found  her.  She  was  the  only  player  present.  The  others,  it  seemed,  had  finished  with  the  picture,  "Men  Must  Fight,"  and  only  her  scenes  remained.  I  remembered  that  the  picture  was  laid  in  the  year  1940.   She  stood  alone,  a  tall,  slender  young  woman  in  a  gray  wig  and  strange  dress,  in  the  center  of  the  stage  with  the  bright  Klieg  lights  blazing  down  upon  her.  Awaiting  the  signal  from  the  director.  Behind  the  cameras  were  the  shadowy  figures  of  a  dozen  or  so  workmen.  She  was  the  only  woman  on  the  set,  except  Daisy,  her  maid.  Quietly  I  crept  off  to  the  side,  and  waited.    Then  came  a  faint  whirr  from  the  sound  box.   "They're  turning  over,"  a  voice  called  from  somewhere.  We  all  waited  in  utter  silence.  She,  standing  there,  calm  and  serene,  under  the  lights.    Now,  the  signal!    And  then  began  a   38    WAS  vaguely  conscious  as  she  spoke,  that  the  workmen  near  me,  had  crept  out  from  behind  their  lights.  That  they,  as  I,  were  no  longer  on  a  sound  stage  on  a  motion  picture  lot  in  Hollywood.  We  were  standing  on  a  barren  field  in  Flanders,  strewn  with  tiny  white  crosses.   In  our  hearts  tore  the  pain  of  those  an-  guished mothers.  In  our  breasts  beat  their  aching  hearts.  She  went  on  to  the  end.  And  finished  in  silence.  It  seemed  that  we  could  never  speak  again.  Or  find  anything  to  say.  She  seemed  to  sense  it  as  she  stood  there  in  the  silence  and  smiled  brightly  at  us.  Uttering  some  bit  of  nonsense  that  brought  us  all  back  again  to  Hollywood  and  the  making  of  movies.  "  How  do  you  fancy  the  styles  of  1940?  "  she  asked,  after  we  shook  hands  in  greeting.   "I  can't  bear  them,"  I  said,  "don't  tell  me  split  skirts  and  those  awful  hats  are  ahead  of  us."   "Adrian,  our  designer,  seems  to  think  so,"  turning  about  for  us  to  examine  the  atrocious  looking  outfit.  "He  figures  that  this  will  be  the  only  style  which  hasn't  come  in  for  a  revival  by  that  time,  so  we'll  just  naturally  be  in  for  it."   All  the  time  she  was  speaking,  the  question,  "How  old  is  this  woman?  "  kept  turning  about  in  my  mind.  Knowing  her  to  be  a  young  woman,  in  her  twenties,  still  we  ask  it.   Daisy,  the  maid,  was  flying  about,  fussing  with  this  and  that.  "Daisy  is  so  happy  I'm  having  a  bit  of  attention  from  the  press,"  she  twinkled.  "Naturally,  not  being  very  well  known  yet,  I  haven't  had  many  interviews  and  very  little  publicity  from  the  studio,  and  it  makes  Daisy  furious.

Franchot  was  elected  to  be  Joan  Crawford's  brother  in  her  latest  starring  vehicle,  "Today  We  Live."  Are  we  wrong  in  predicting  that  this  impish  smile  gives  promise  of  working  untold  havoc  and  rousing  storms  in  the  hearts  of  the  ladies    Filming  Helen  Hayes'  most  solemn  scene    HERE  we  glimpse  some  of  the  tender  care  and  unflagging  attention  to  detail  which  went  into  portraying  Helen  Hayes  ready  to  take  her  vow  as  a  nun,  for  the  talking  picture  version  of  the  well-known  novel,  "The  White  Sister."  written  by  F.  Marion  Crawford.  It  was  the  silent  version  with  Lillian  Gish,  you    may  remember,  that  many  think  really  made  Ronald  Colman  on  the  screen,  away  back  in  1923,  and  also  wrote  a  chapter  in  the  history  of  outstanding  screen  successes  by  playing  to  crowds  when  reshown  several  years  after  its  premiere.  Judging  from  this  picture,  we  may  expect  an    equally  notable  rendition  in  this  version,  now  being  done  by  M-G-M.  Note  that  instead  of  merely  filling  the  area  visible  to  the  camera,  the  producers  have  provided  a  full  company,  with  complete  detail  and  action  to  the  most  remote  corner  on  either  side  of  the  camera.  Note  too  the  perfection  of  feeling  shown  by  May  Robson    Photo  by  Stagg    in  a  new  version  of  "The  White  Sister"    and  Sarah  Padden,  playing  the  two  nuns  ac-  companying Helen.  And  while  Director  Victor  Fleming — visible  just  over  the  watching  officer's  head — scans  each  principal,  his  as-  sistant, Cullen  "Hezzy"  Tate,  is  keeping  a  vigilant  eye  upon  every  member  of  the  support-  ing company,  from  a  post  just  beneath  the    camera,  while  the  producing  staff  is  grouped  about,  alert  to  catch  every  command  and  the  full  values  of  the  portrayal.   Now  just  a  word  about  that  officer,  visible  in  the  foreground.  He  is  watching  from  off  set,  and  is  not  playing  in  this  scene.  He  is  Giovanni,  Helen's  youthful  sweetheart.     But    beneath  that  make-up  you  may  or  may  not  recognize  him  as — Clark  Gable.   Throughout  this  and  other  scenes  embodying  church  ritual  and  ceremony,  everything  was  done  under  the  guidance  of  two  priests,  who  traveled  extensively  in  Italy  before  undertak-  ing the  task.

Anyhow,  Lilian  makes  this  the  last  word  in  lounging  pajamas,  as  you'll  admit    200  lbs.  of   Irishman    Andy  Devine  plays  everything  from  serio-comic  lover  to  football  hero  roles   By   Ruth    Rankin    HE'S  two  hundred  pounds  of  Irishman,  bulging  with  sentiment — but  if  you  call  Andy  Devine  "senti-  mental" to  his  face,  you'd  better  smile  when  you  say  it.   Andy  was  just  a  big  kid  around  town  for  six  years  before  he  got  his  break.  He  started  doing  extra  work  in  the  "Col-  legian" series,  and  pretty  soon  everybody  knew  Andy.  Every-  body, that  is,  except  the  people  who  hand  out  the  jobs.   In  those  days  he  had  time  to  be  palsy-walsy  with  all  the  boys — in  fact,  there  were  intervals  when  all  Andy  had  was  time.   Then  came  "The  Spirit  of  Notre  Dame" — and  they've  kept  him  busy  ever  since.   He  gets  terribly  blue  now  because  lots  of  the  old  pals  don't  understand.     They  resent  it.     But —   "When  I'm  busy  on  a  picture,  I  have  to  concentrate,"  says  Andy.  "When  I  see  some  of  the  old  guard  now,  I  can't  stop  and  kid  around  for  an  hour  or  two,  like  we  used  to.   "I  hope  they  don't  think  old  Andy's  gone  high-hat  on  'em —  but  I  hear  things.    Gosh,  if  I'm  high-hat,  so's  a  cow!"   Andy  looked  wistful,  and  when  he  looks  that  way,  try  and  keep  your  heart  from  aching  for  him.  It  was  a  genuine  prob-  lem, and  Andy  was  genuinely  troubled.   He  tried  out  a  lot  of  things  in  his  extreme  youth,  just  like  any  other  lad  endeavoring  to  find  himself.  At  fifteen  and  sixteen  he  was  in  a  monastery,  wondering  whether  he  would  be  a  priest.  Then  he  floundered  through  attacks  of  being  a  life-  guard, a  surveyor's  assistant,  a  professional  football  player,  an  electrical  signal  operator  for  the  Santa  Fe — and  once  he  was  in  the  U.  S.  Lighthouse  Service,  on  a  boat  that  carried  supplies  to  remote  lighthouses  up  in  Bering  Sea.   When  he  came  back  to  the  States,  he  played  professional  football  for  a  time — he  had  been  one  of  the  best  all-around  athletes  at  the  University  of  Santa  Clara.   ABOUT  that  time,  Andy's  dad  took  him  off  in  a  corner  and  gave  him  some  advice.  "I  don't  care  what  you  do,  when  you  finally  light — but  whatever  it  is,  be  good  at  it.  If  you're  going  to  be  a  burglar,  be  the  best  burglar  in  town.  But  make  up  your  mind,  son,  and  stick  to  it."   So  Andy  came  to  Hollywood  and  made  up  his  mind  to  be  a  movie  actor.   "I  was  nuts  about  pictures  from  the  first  day's  work,"  he  says,  his  nice  honest  eyes  full  of  enthusiasm,  and  that  per-  petual lock  of  curly  hair  in  his  right  eye.  "It's  good  I  was.  You'd  have  to  be  nuts  to  stick  around  six  years  with  no  more  encouragement  than  I  got.  I  did  extra  work  so  long,  I  had  my  own  personal  tights  and  spear!   "But  the  industry  struggled  along  without  me,  except  as  a  chunk  of  background — until  'The  Spirit  of  Notre  Dame.'"    Yes,  sir,  it's  easy  to  believe  that  this  happy-go-lucky  Andy  Devine  is  going  to  go  places  and  do  things,  now  that  he's  struck  his  stride.  Remember  this  heart-  touching  scene  with  dainty  June  Clyde  in  "Radio  Patrol"?    When  Andy  heard  they  were  preparing  that  picture,  he  didn't  wait  around  for  fate  or  chance  any  longer.  He  shook  the  hair  out  of  his  eyes,  delivered  his  big  loose-jointed  hulk  into  Carl  Laemmle  Jr.'s  office,  and  reminded  Mr.  Laemmle  that  football  was  one  of  Devine's  major  talents.   "It  was  something  I  really  knew  a  lot  about,  so  that  gave  me  confidence.  But  gosh,  was  I  scared  when  I  actually  real-  ized I  had  been  in  to  see  the  boss!  Too  scared  to  put  on  an  act."   Apparently  though,  the  boss,  too,  realized  things.  Andy  is  a  "natural"  and  it  got  across.  He  was  given  a  real  part.  Before  the  picture  was  half  finished,  he  had  distinguished  himself  to  the  point  of  being  presented  with  a  dotted  line  to  sign  on.  And  it's  happened  since,  as  regularly  as  "new  Greta  Garbos"  are  announced.   ANDY  has  two  nephews  and  four  nieces,  several  of  them  children  of  a  sister  who  died.  He  is  putting  one  niece  through  college  and  getting  a  tremendous  kick  out  of  it.   "I  was  the  blunderbuss  of  the  family  for  so  many  years —  always  getting  my  arms  and  legs  busted  and  having  to  be  bailed  out  of  hospitals.  So  it  gives  me  a  big  thrill  to  be  able  to  do  anything  at  all  for  the  family,  now  I'm  grown  up."   Another  glimpse  of  Andy's  two-hundred-pound  ways:  When  he  has  a  load  on  his  chest  and  needs  a  friendly  ear,  he  and  Truck  get  in  the  car  and  drive  down  along  the  ocean  front.  Truck  is  Andy's  dog,  named  for  Truck  McCall,  the  character  Andy  played  in  "The  Spirit  of  Notre  Dame"  .  .  .  and  Truck  is  the  rest  of  Andy's  family.

It  seems,  every  time  Gary  Cooper,  Joan's  six  foot  leading  man,  entered  a  scene,  he  bumped  into  the  microphone,  nearly  splitting  his  head  and  sending  strange  and  peculiar  sounds  through  the  instrument.  If  they  raised  the  mike,  it  was  too  far  away  to  catch  the  voices  of  other  actors.     But  at  last,  the  bright  young  camera-    "Oowhatlip, Monsieur!"

He  discovered  she  was  Margaret  McConnell    U    The  Monthly  Broadcast   of   Hollywood  Goings-On/    Berlin  received  Clara  Bow  warmly.

During  the  first  show,  it  seems,  Roxy  climbed  to  the  topmost  seat  in  the  balcony  and  looked  down  over  the  vast  audi-  torium. Just  then,  several  elephants  paraded  across  the  stage.   Roxy  looked  and  stared.  "What?"  he  shrieked.  "Mice  in  my  theater  already?"

LIVER  MOROSCO  had  him  under  con-  tract.    Selwyn  wanted  to  buy  him.   "What  do  you  want  to  use  him  for?"  Morosco  asked.  "I   want  him  for  a  comedy  part,"  Selwyn  an-  swered.   "Why,   he's  a  bum   comedian,"   Morosco   said,  "but  he's  a  swell  dramatic  actor. "   "Well,  I  think  he's  a  bum  dramatic  actor  but  a  swell  comedian. "    Selwyn  replied,  and  got  him.  They  were  talking  about  Charlie  Ruggles.  "I  thought  the  same  as  Selwyn,"  Charlie  said.  "If  this  guy's  willing  to  risk  money  on  my  being  a  comedian,  why  he  must  know  what  he's  talking  about,  so  I'll  be  funny."    And  that's  how  matter  of  fact  Charlie's  career  has  been  from  the  be-  ginning.   But  that  doesn't  account  for  the  intense  interest  he  takes  in  it,  does  it?    Or,  maybe  it  does  at  that.   In  twelve  months  he's  made  fourteen  movies.  And  has  one  great  problem.  Keeping  in  the  picture.  It's  a  battle  he  fights  every  time  he  makes  a  picture.  You  see,  it's  easier  to  cut  a  bit  of  Charlie  out  of  the  story  than  it  is  the  hero.  Or  heroine.  "They  have  an  idea,"  Charlie  explains,  "that  unless  the  villain  or  hero  is  in  the  scene,  the  picture  lags.  So,  snip  with  the  scissors,  and  out  comes  me. "   SO  what  does  Charlie  do?  Let  them  snip  and  get  away  with  it?  No,  listen.  He  is  given,  by  Charlie's  request,  every  script  of  his  picture  to  read.  Okay.  Then  he's  allowed,  also  by  his  own  request,  to  monkey  around  a  bit  with  his  scenes.  Okay  some  more.     Then,  what  does  he  do?   Well,  he  fixes  those  scenes  of  his  so  that  if  they  cut  out  Charlie,  it  leaves  the  hero  hanging  from  an  upstairs  window  with  scarcely  anybody  around  to  catch  him.  In  other  words,  Charlie,  the  rascal,  fixes  it  so  that  if  they  decide  that  here  goes  good  old  Charlie  out — why  the  hero  or  heroine  will  have  to  go  too,  or  it  makes  no  sense.   Oh,  you'd  like  Charlie  Ruggles.  He's  a  smart  little  whipper-  snapper  all  right,  all  right.   If  he  isn't  playing  a  straight  comedy  part  on  the  screen,  why  then,  Charlie  is  stewed  (on  the  screen,  of  course)  to  the  ears.  And  what  a  stew  Charlie  can  be!  You  remember  him,  of  course,  as  the  constantly  inebriated  reporter  of  "70,000  Witnesses."  But  the  funny  thing  is,  in  every  day  life  Charlie  is  never  stewed,  and  can  have  more  fun  with  one  glass  of  beer  (near  or  real)  and  a  silly  pretzel,  than  any  ten  guys  can  have  with  six  quarts  of  what-have-you,  apiece.   Over  the  New  Year  at  Caliente,  here  was  so-and-so  com-  pletely pie-eyed,  and  here  was  Charlie,  having   a  far  better   time  on  one  stein  of  beer  and    Charlie — so  non-  chalant, you  know.  But  what  a  neat  one  he  put  over,  to  make  sure  his  pictures  treat  him  right !    a  table  for  two.   Over  at  the  Caliente  race  track,  a  fellow  popped  over  to  Charlie  and  said,  "Say,  Rug-  gles, how  does  that  horse  look   [ PLEASE    TURN    TO    PAGE    99  ]    A8    The  G    amest    Lrirl    In  Hollywood    Yes,  Mae  Clarke  earns  the  title  by  her  great  comeback  after  taking  a  stag-  gering   knockout    Mae  looks  the  grand  trouper  she  is.      Do  you  see  what  sorrow  has  done  to  the  Mae  of  "Waterloo  Bridge"?    SHE  had  won — or  rather  thought  she  had — everything  in  life  that  an  ambitious  girl  could  desire.  A  prominent  position  in  the  films,  the  love  of  a  man  high  up  in  studio  circles.  And  she  was  young.  Life  spread  not  merely  pleasantly,  but  thoroughly  exciting  before  her.   Thus  did  fortune  smile  upon  Mae  Clarke.  Then  suddenly  she  lost  everything — her  picture  contract,  her  means  of  livelihood,  her  health — and  love.   But  defeated?    No,  never!   After  months  in  a  hospital  with  a  nervous  breakdown,  Mae  went  right  at  it  again.   "During  those  months  I  made  myself  over,"  she  said,  "men-  tally and  spiritually.  I  lay  there  and  thought,  and  the  thoughts  gave  me  the  strength  to  come  back  and  to  start  all  over  again."   Now  it  looks  as  though  Mae  has  won  for  the  second  time.  Things  again  are  breaking  her  way.  She  isn't  the  same  girl  she  used  to  be,  of  course;  no  longer  the  same  Mae  who  wrapped  her-  self around  your  heart  in  "Waterloo  Bridge."   But  the  very  scars  which  she  got  in  the  battle  have  made  her  more  beautiful,  her  hurts  have  made  her  soul  that  much  bigger.  She  can  feel,  now,  as  she  never  felt  before.  It  takes  suffering  to  do  that,  and  Mae  has  suffered.  Also,  she  has  a  new  courage,  and  it's  that  new  courage,  the  courage  born  of  her  very  heart-  aches, which  makes  Mae  Clarke  the  gamest  girl  in  Hollywood.  I?        J?  *   Mae's    early    training    particularly  -OJV   JxOglTia    fitted  her  for  the  bruising  Fate  had  in  store.  The  Clarkes  were  not  rich  folks.  The  father  was  a  violinist  in  a  movie  theater,  and  besides  Mae,  there  were  her  brother  and  sister  to  clothe  and  feed.   Mae  learned  very  early  to  fight  her  battles  for  herself.  Among  other  things,  as  a  kid  of  fifteen,  she  sold  hot  dogs  and  salt  water  taffy  on  the  Boardwalk  at  Atlantic  City.  Doing  that,  a  girl  learns  how  to  fight  her  battles  for  herself.   BETWEEN  times  she  went  to  dancing  school,  and  this  led  to  a  chorus  Job  in  a  musical  show.  Then  she  went  to  New  York,  where  she  became  a  nightclub  dancer.  That's  another  grand  way  to  learn  to  fight  your  own  battles,  being  a  nightclub  dancer.  While  in  the  Everglades  Club  in  New  York,  Mae  met  Bar-  bara Stanwyck,  who  also  was  a  chorine  there.  The  two  girls  became  inseparable,  and  that  friendship  still  endures.  Barbara  got  a  break  in  a  play  called  "The  Noose,"  and  then  came  "  Burlesque,"  which  led  directly  to  her  present  Hollywood  fame.  Mae  had  a  small  part  in  "The  Noose."   "It  was  years  later  when   I    hit   Hollywood,"  Mae   remi-  nisced, "after  I  had  trouped  for  two  seasons  in  vaudeville.  But  while  we  were  in  New  York,  Barbara  and  I  would  sit  at  the  breakfast  table  and,  even  then,  we  both  dreamed  of  Holly-  wood."

No  wonder  Carole  grinned  and  bore  it,  regardless  of  how  much  Sylvia  might  whack,  twist  and  knead  her    THE  first  time  I  saw  her,  I  was  stand-  ing behind  her  and  she  was  walking  across  the  studio  lot.  She  was  a  big,  husky  girl  in  a  short  white  silk  sports  dress,  flat  white  tennis  shoes,  rolled  down  socks  and  a  beret  in  her  hand.  And  she  was  calling  to  the  boys  she  knew  as  they  passed.  "Hello,  Bob!  Hello,  Bill!"  Hearty  and  hale  like,  just  as  her  figure  looked.  The  studio  executive  who  was  show-  ing me  around — it  was  my  first  day  at  that  studio — looked  at  the  girl,  then  turned  to  me.  "There,"  he  said,  "that  girl  is  under  contract.  We're  supposed  to  give  her  parts.  But  look  at  that  figure!  Think  you  can  do  anything?  "   "She'll  be  my  first  patient,"  I  said.  I  set  up  shop  in  Gloria  Swanson's  old  dressing-room  bungalow  and  about  five  minutes  later  in  came  the  exec  with  the  same  buxom  girl  I  had  seen  from  the  rear.  I'll  admit  I  was  startled.  Honestly,  she  had  one  of  the  most  attractive  and  beauti-  ful faces  I've  ever  seen.  And  a  nice  expres-  sion, too.   50    Meet  "Carol  of  the  Curves,"  as  they  called  her  before  Sylvia  stepped  in!

See  page  80  for  Sylvia's  answers  to  your  beauty  questions!    "Think  you  can  do  anything  with  this  one?"  the  boss  asked.   "You  bet  I  can,"  I  said.  "Give  me  four  weeks  with  her — ■  and  you'll  be  amazed,"   "I'll  bet  I  will,"  said  the  boss  and  left  Carole  Lombard  with  her  fate — and  me!  (I  know  there  was  a  time  they  called  her  "Carol,"  "Carol  of  the  Curves,"  in  fact,  which  was  the  reason  I  was  starting  in  on  her;  but  I'll  stick  to  Carole.)   I  liked  Carole  right  away.  You  couldn't  be  around  her  and  not  like  her.  She  was  breezy  and  clever  and  so  regular  and  oh,  how  badly  she  wanted  to  get  thin!    She  knew  how  fat  she  was.   I'd  told  the  exec  I'd  have  her  in  shape — and  with  a  shape —  in  four  weeks.    It  took  me  just  three  weeks  to  make  her  so  that  she  could  take  a  size  twelve  dress.    And  that  first  little  white  silk  number  I'd  seen  her  in,  which  fit  her  plenty  snug,  was  a  sixteen!    Cross  my  heart  and  hope  to  die!   Now  that  I'm  no  longer  at  the  studio  I  can  confess  that  I  cheated  a  little  bit.  You  see  the  studio  was  paying  me  a  salary  then,  and  a  big  one.  The  stars  were  paying  the  studio  for  my  treatments;  the  money  was  taken  out  of  their  salaries  each  week.  Carole  was  paying  for  a  treatment  a  day — ■  but  I  put  one  over  on  the  studio  and  gave  her  an  extra  treat-  ment every  day  on  studio  time.   A  GREAT  deal  of  my  success  in  Hollywood  lay  in  mak-  ing the  stars  obey  me.  And  they  obeyed  me  because  they  knew  they  had  to.  Unless  their  figures  were  nice  their  con-  tracts weren't  renewed.  Carole  was  perfect  about  it.  She  did  everything  I  said.  We  used  to  have  luncheon  together  almost  every  day  in  the  little  restau-  rant across  from  the  studio.  She  used  to  watch  great  big  juicy  steaks  and  mashed  potatoes  and  creamed  peas  going  by  to  other  tables  and  then  she'd  say  to  the  waiter,  "And  as  for  me —  a  green  salad  with  French  dressing — mostly  lemon  juice  —and  gelatin  for  dessert."   Because  she  was  such  a  good  sport  and  never  whined  I  used  to  let  her  have  a  little  piece  of   [  PLEASE  TURN  TO  PAGE  80  ]    A  month  of  pummeling,  twisting,  dieting,  and  then  be-  hold what  emerged — the  exquisite  Carole  Lombard  of  today !

John  and  his  lovely  bride,  Virginia  Bruce,  are  about  to  sit  down  to  dinner  in  their  spacious  dining-room.     In  fact,  Perkins,  the  butler,  has  just  placed  his  left  thumb  in  the  clear  soup,  when  the  door  bell  rings.     He  hurriedly  places  the  soup  and  answers  the  door.   "  Good  evening,  Perkins,"  a  sweet,  low  voice  reaches  the  Gilbert  dining-room,  "John,  dear,  at  home?"   "  Er — why — Miss— I — "   " It's  all  right,  Perkins.  You  remember  me,  don't  you?  I'm  just  a  member  of  the  Gilbert  sorority.  I  mean  I'm  an  ex-Mrs.  Gilbert,  Perkins.     Second,  I  believe.     Where's  everybody?"   "In  the  dining-room,  Miss,  but  I  think  you'd  better — "   Into  the  dining-room,  to  the  utter  amazement  of  John  and  Virginia,  bursts  the  lovely  and  beautiful  ex-Mrs.  Gilbert,  Leatrice  Joy,  calmly  removing  her  gloves  and  silver  foxes.   "Why,  hello  John,  dear.  Hello  Virginia,  sweet.  You  look  adorable  in  that  blue  frock.  What  lovely  soup.  Mind  if  I  sip  at  yours,  Jack  dear?  Mmmmmm — Virginia,  it's  too  peppery.  Pepper,  I  always  found,  made  John  sneeze  for  hours.  Days  even."   She  went  on  with  the  soup,  sitting  on  the  arm  of  Virginia's  chair,  while  John  and  Virginia  sat  wide-eyed  and  open-  mouthed.  John  unable  to  rise.  Par-  alyzed from  the  Adam's  apple  down,  in  fact.   "Look  here,  Leatrice,"  John  manages  to  say  thickly,  when  the  door  bell  rings.   "  Well,  if  it  isn't  Perkins,  as  I  have  my  gorgeous  being,"  a  charming,  husky  toned  voice  reached  the  strange  trio  in  the  dining-room.  "Where's  everybody?"   52    "You  see,  Virginia,  dear,"  said  Ina,  "about  letting  John  walk  through  his  cactus  gar-  den in  his  bare  feet.

We'll  play  later.  You  can  be  Rosco  and  I'll  be  Ben  Turpin.

"Soup,  as  I  live,"  she  gurgles  and  promptly  sitting  on  the  arm  of  Jack's  chair,  finishes  his  soup,  while  Jack  reaches  over  with  a  numb  and  trembling  hand  and  calmly  pours  the  remainder  of  Virginia's  now  cold  broth  over  his  dark  and  throbbing  head.    Ina  continues  sipping  appraisingly.   "Lovely.    But  too  salty,  Virginia,"  she  says.    "I  found  too  much  salt  was  bad  for  Jack.     Made  him  hiccough."    "TT  w;   -1-him    Tch,  tch,  tch!

"Salt,"  Ina  firmly  contends,  glaring  at  Leatrice  over  Jack's  and  Virginia's  heads.     "And  it  made  him — What  was  it  salt  always  made  you  do,  dear?"  she  asked  Jack  sweetly.     "One  forgets  minor  noises  so  easily,  these  fast  moving  days."  "My  Gawd,"  John  breathes  feverishly.  "Bring  on  the  next  course,  Perkins,"  Ina  called  gaily.   "Ooooo-eeee."

"  We  used  to  have  our  salad  before  the  entree,  Perkins,"  says  Leatrice.   "I  know,  Miss,"  Perkins  says,  bursting  into  tears  and  laying  his  head  on  her  shoulder.

Not  because  she  is  retir-  ing or  just  too  exclusive  for  words,  my  deah.  Heavens  no.  She's  just  not  interested.  But — and  is  she  smart? — movie  devotees  see  her.  By  scores  of  thousands.  And  that's  why,  after  seven  years  of  movie  making,  she's  still  going  strong.    Stronger  than  that,  in  fact.   Some  twenty  years  ago  little  Myrna  Williams  — the  Loy  is  merely  a  movie  name — lived  on  Fifth  Avenue  in  Helena,  Mon-  tana, and  right  on  the  next  street  lived  a  tall,  sober-faced  little  boy  whose  name  was  Cooper.  Frank,  his  folks  called  him.  And  Mrs.  Williams  used  to  call  on  Mrs.  Cooper  and  dis-  cuss the  weather,  the  Ladies'  Aid  meeting,  Frank's  tonsils  and  Myrna's  dancing  lessons.  Little  dreaming  that  one  day  Frank  would  be  the  heart-  breaker  of  Hollywood,  and  Myrna  the  best  Chinese  menace  that  ever  came  out  of  Montana.  When  Myrna  was  seven  her  father  died  and  the  family  moved  to  Santa  Monica,  Cali-  fornia. And  was  she  a  comical-  looking  kid  those  days,  with  her  bright  carrot  hair  and  masses  and  masses  of  freckles?  Big?  And  gawky?  Well,  the  kids  in  the  neighborhood  nearly  passed  out  when  Myrna  in-  sisted she'd  be  a  movie  actress.  But  mother  had  looked  be-  neath the  freckles  and  gawki-  ness  and  wasn't  so  sure.  Not  so  sure  that  perhaps  that  little  oval  face,  those  full-lidded  green  eyes,  that  gaily  tilted  nose    Yes,  when  we  see  you  a  I'Americaine,  Myrna,  we  see  a  great  future.  Still,  we  see  too  why  they  kept  you  "East  of  Suez"  so  long.  Just  a  touch  on  those  eyes,  and  oh!  what  a  daughter  to  Fu  Manchu  you  made !  Who  can  do  that  now,  we  ask  you?    might  not  mean  a  thing  or  two  some  day.   And  mother  was  right.   Myrna  went  in  for  dancing  and  finally,  in  her  'teens,  landed  in  a  Sid  Grauman  prologue  at  the  Egyptian  Theater.  Her  photograph,  with  a  dozen  others,  stood  in  the  lobby.  One  day  a  dark-eyed,  dark-haired  young  man  glimpsed  that  face.  And  stopped.  Valentino,  if  you  please,  was  interested.   HE  looked  her  up  and  had  her  tested  for  a  part  in  one  of  his  pictures.  Too  young.  But  Mrs.  Valentino  (Natacha  Rara-  bova)  was  so  enchanted  she  offered  a  small  part  in  her  own  picture,  "What  Price  Beauty?"   The  picture  was  a  classic  flop.  But  it  started  Myrna  Loy  in  the  movies,  and  she's  been  going  right  along  since  then — nursing  a  growing  pas-  sionate purpose.   This  one  great,  flaming  de-  sire is  to  get  away  from  Oriental  roles.  For  years  she  fought  against  it,  and  it  did  no  good.   Perhaps  it's  because  she  achieves  that  Oriental  look  so  readily  that  they  constantly  kept  thrusting  her  into  those  parts.    Her  eyes,  remember,  do   [  PLEASE  TURN  TO  PAGE  93  ]   53    Select  Your    Pictures    and    You    Won't    *    MEN  MUST  FIGHT— M-G-M    AMONG  those  things  Hollywood  usually  fights  shy  of  are  so-called  "problem  plays" — ones  where  the  play  asks  a  question  and  you  give  the  answer.  As  a  rule,  they're  too  slippery  to  handle,  both  as  to  production  and  as  to  public  reaction.   But  if  anything  can  turn  the  trick,  it  should  be  the  cast  of  this  one,  headed  by  Diana  Wynyard.  The  problem  lies  between  her,  made  a  pacifist  of  the  most  intense  stripe  by  bitter  experience,  her  husband  (Lewis  Stone),  whose  love  for  her  cannot  over-ride  his  patriotism,  and  the  son  (Phillips  Holmes)  is  tossed  between  the  two  views  when  war  suddenly  breaks  out.   You  may  find  irritations,  but  you'll  see  some  excellent  acting,  especially  by  Diana  and  Lewis  Stone.    *    THE  GREAT  JASPER— RKO-Radio    CHIEFLY  noteworthy  for  a  grand  performance  by  Rich-  ard Dix,  as  the  convivial  Irishman  of  the  good  old  days  who  graduates  from  a  horsecar  "motorman"  to  a  fortune-  teller, and  the  presence  of  the  new  importation,  Wera  Engels,  who  is  due  to  click.  The  motorman,  who  takes  his  women  and  his  whisky  where  he  finds  'em,  has  two  sons,  one  by  his  wife  and  one  by  the  wife  of  his  boss;  the  two  boys  are  as  far  apart  as  his  wife — an  unsympathetic  part  beautifully  done  by  Florence  Eldridge — and  himself.  It's  the  story  of  two  families,  thus  closely  entwined,  down  through  the  years;  Betty  Furness  is  charming,  and  there's  far  too  little  of  Edna  May  Oliver.   Inevitably  reminiscent  of  "Cimarron" — but   it   isn't   a  "Cimarron,"  though.   5+    The    Shadow    A  Review  of  the  New  Pictures    *    TOPAZE— RKO-Radio    WITHOUT  the  slightest  facetious  intent,  we  may  char-  acterize this  gem  of  a  picture  by  saying  it  answers  that  years-old  query:  What  would  happen  to  John  Barry-  more  without  aid  from  his  classic  profile?  For  trivial  as  that  sounds,  the  profile's  gradual  emergence  is  so  superbly  in  keeping  with  the  story,  that  many  will  vote  this  John's  greatest  to  date.   It  happens,  you  see,  that  John  starts  as  M.  Topaze,  a  drab  French  schoolmaster,  so  na'i've  he  believes  people  ac-  tually obey  the  moral  maxims  he  teaches.  That  is  where,  hidden  behind  pedagogic  whiskers,  you'll  never  know  John.  But  thanks  to  his  refusing  distinction  to  the  son  (Jackie  Searl)  of  a  rich  man,  M.  Topaze  moves  on  to  the  world  as  it  is — and  begins  to  learn.  One  lesson:  While  his  job  as  chemist  for  a  highly  respectable  racket  does  not  ask  pur-  suit of  scientific  truth,  his  boss  (Reginald  Mason)  can  get  him  the  coveted  Academy  decoration.  Lesson  two:  His  boss's  mistress  (Myrna  Loy)  is  quite  willing  to  be  amused.   So  our  lowly  grub  begins  to  change  (and  the  profile  to  emerge),  and  the  two  changes  match  so  perfectly  you  never  even  think  what  superb  "theater"  it  is.  Meanwhile,  the  supporting  cast  is  not  only  maintaining,  but  enhancing  the  illusion,  even  though  Myrna 's  role  is  not  as  rich  as  it  might  be.     You  can't  afford  to  miss  this  one.

But  when  you  add  to  this  fine  cast  a  whimsical  tale  that  fairly  breathes  the  charm  side  of  life  on  the  farm;  intro-  duces chuckles  and  laughs,  especially  when  that  city  fellow,  Lew  Ayres,  intrigues  Janet  and  Norman  tumbles  for  the  trapeze  artiste,  Sally  Eilers;  and  steps  right  along  from  start  to  finish;  you'll  know  why  we  say  this  scores  a  bull's-eye.   Will  Rogers,  of  course,  is  himself — interested  this  time  in  showing  his  pet  hog,  "Blue  Boy,"  at  the  fair,  while  Ma  brings  her  pickles  and  mince  meat.  Perhaps  this  time  there  are  not  so  many  droll  whimsies — but  you'll  feel  his  power  to  tug  at  the  heart  when  "Blue  Boy"  takes  sick  just  before  prize  time.  Janet,  too,  has  just  the  sort  of  role  needed  to  bring  out  what  people  seem  most  to  love — espe-  cially when  she  and  brother  fall  into  their  complications  among  the  visitors  to  the  fair.   Then  when  Ma,  in  her  prize  quest,  gives  her  mince  meat  the  aid  of  high-voltage  brandy  and  the  committee  of  ex-  perts falls  to  appraising  its  merits,  you'll  probably  feel  that  there's  no  fun  to  improve  upon  that  at  state  fairs.  All  in  all,  beyond  question  here's  superb  entertainment  for  the  whole  family.    &    CLEAR  ALL  WIRES— M-G-M    LEE  TRACY  steps  forth  as  Buckley  Joyce  Thomas,  a  high-powered  newspaper  correspondent — the  kind  who  in  the  absence  of  news  makes  it  out  of  whole  cloth  or  even  from  his  own  broken  arm.  And  as  he  bamboozles  his  em-  ployer and  public,  you'll  agree  that  also  he  achieves  some-  thing rare  in  screen  fun.   Even  before  Lee  starts  for  Russia  on  his  news-making  quest,  he  makes  news  of  a  sort  by  taking  the  boss's  girl  (Una  Merkel)  along  just  for  company  .  .  .  minus  the  boss's  knowledge  or  consent.  With  him  also  goes  his  faithful  Lefty  (Jimmy  Gleason) — a  lad  who,  like  Lee,  doesn't  mind  starting  revolutions  or  taking  pot-shots  at  a  price  for  a  head-  line. You  can  imagine  what  happens  when  this  crew,  plus  Benita  Hume,  strikes  Russia  and  starts  stirring  things  up.    tV    SECRETS— United  Artists    NOW,  after  a  weary,  long  wait  on  our  part,  a  new,  beau-  tiful and  stirring  Mary  Pickford  comes  back  in  a  pic-  ture that  just  misses  by  inches  being  a  classic — perhaps  because  somehow  we  can't  feel  that  Leslie  Howard  is  quite  in  his  metier  as  a  sturdy  Western  rancher.   Mary,  though,  is  believable  at  all  times — and  that  is  the  main  thing  in  a  tale  concerned  with  a  luxury-reared  Yankee  girl  who  seeks  the  frontier  with  her  sweetheart,  as  the  alter-  native to  marrying  a  title.  C.  Aubrey  Smith  and  Blanche  Fridenci  as  Mary's  purse-proud,  socially  ambitious  parents,  and  Ned  Sparks  as  Leslie's  staunch  helper  in  his  battles  with  nature  and  cattle  thieves,  likewise  are  splendid.   You  can  be  sure  you  won't  make  any  mistake  by  taking  the  family  to  see  it.   55    The   National   Guide   to   Motion    Pictures    (REG.  U.  S.  PAT.  OFF.)    £    PRIVATE   JONES—   Universal    Tl    a  B    *    FROM  HELL  TO  HEAVEN  — Paramount    YOU'LL  sense  a  fine  double-barreled  kick  in  this  Lee  Tracy  portrayal  of  a  cocky  and  belligerent  buck  private,  who  is  on  the  horns  of  a  dilemma  throughout.  On  the  one  hand  is  his  mother's  training  against  war,  and  his  own  lack  of  enmity  to  Germans.  On  the  other,  he  falls  for  a  sweet  little  Y.  M.  C.  A.  worker  (Gloria  Stuart),  married  to  a  lieutenant  he  hates.  The  result  is  red-blooded  entertainment,  with  food  for  thought.    A  DIFFERENT  sort  of  story  with  spice,  comedy,  tragedy,  and  Jack  Oakie  thrown  in  to  provide  ample  good  measure.  One  by  one,  the  characters  filter  in  to  take  rooms  at  a  hotel  near  a  race  track.  From  there  on  the  story  steps  out,  with  many  a  thrill  and  chuckle,  until  death,  comedy,  happiness  bring  it  to  the  fadeout.  There's  good  entertainment  here  for  nearly  everybody.    &    THE  KING'S  VACATION—  Warners    BLONDIE  JOHNSON-  First  National    AGAIN  George  Arliss  takes  a  somewhat  light  story  and,  with  Arlissean  suavity,  turns  it  into  delightful  entertain-  ment. This  time  he's  a  King,  happily  freed  by  a  revolution  from  his  oppressive  job.  He  is  freed  also  by  the  Queen  (Mrs.  Arliss)  to  seek  the  love  he  renounced  (Marjorie  Gateson)  when  he  married.  But  freedom's  rosy  promises  turn  out  to  have  thorns — from  which  Mr.  Arliss  draws  a  filmful  of  fun.    PLENTY  of  action,  some  good  laughs  and  fine  acting  turn  a  none-too-thrilling  plot  into  quite  good  entertainment.  Joan  Blondell,  as  Blond  ie,  and  Chester  Morris  build  up  a  considerable  business  as  private  racketeers.  Then  Chester  gets  ritzy  as  the  well  dressed  business  "front"  of  the  gang,  and  the  resulting  complications  lead  to  capture  of  the  gang  and  what  else  there  is  of  the  story.    THE  CRIME  OF  THE  CENTURY—  Paramount    EX-LADY—  Warners    WELL,  not  quite  the  crime  of  the  century,  but  a  reasonably  acceptable  mystery  picture.  Jean  Hersholt  is  grand  as  Dr.  Emil  Brandt,  who  plans  a  "perfect  murder,"  then  appeals  to  the  law  to  prevent  him  from  committing  it.  This  gives  someone  else  the  idea — guess  who.  We'll  never  tell.  Wynne  Gibson  does  another  swell  naughty  lady.  Cast  good;  but  it's  too  bad  they  didn't  talk  less  and  do  more.   56    THIS  picture  makes  you  wonder  if  maybe  moving  picture  kissing  isn't  rather  a  tough  way  to  earn  a  living  after  all.  Bette  Davis  is  very  pretty  as  the  young  artist  who  doesn't  want  to  marry  her  boy  friend  (Gene  Raymond),  because  she  believes  that  marriage  spoils  love.  She  changes  her  mind,  though,  when  siren  Kay  Strozzi  and  villain  Monroe  Owsley  start  things.     Much  giddy  modern  scenery  and  pretty  clothes.

Junior  Durkin  is  "practically  a  failure  at  seventeen,"  due  to  detecting  instead  of  tending  to  his  job.  He  accidentally  stumbles  on  a  real  plot,  and  solves  the  mystery.  Mrs.  Wallace  Reid  (formerly  known  as  Dorothy  Davenport)  makes  a  pleasing  talking  picture  debut  as  Junior's  mother.    Hope  we'll  see  more  of  her.    PRETTY  fair  when  it  gets  going,  with  a  somewhat  involved  plot  offering  a  distinctly  new  twist  on  the  "mercy  murder"  theme.  The  family  lawyer,  suavely  done  by  Alan  Dinehart,  kills  an  incurable  invalid,  then  fastens  it  on  the  young  family  doctor  (Neil  Hamilton),  because  of  greed  and  his  desire  for  the  doctor's  fiancee  (Mae  Clarke).  As  acting  honors  go,  John  Sheehan,  who  does  the  tramp  Santa  Claus,  lifts  the  show.    THE   SECRETS  OF  WU  SIN—  Invincible    ROME  EXPRESS-  Gaumont  British-  Universal    REAL  Orientals  playing  their  roles  with  feeling  and  talent  give  a  new  and  interesting  angle  to  this  story.  Lois  Wilson,  saved  from  death  by  a  young  newspaper  editor,  Grant  Withers,  becomes  a  reporter,  unearths  a  plot  for  smuggling  Chinamen  into  the  country,  falls  in  love  with  her  editor,  exposes  his  father-  in-law-to-be  as  a  villain  and  gets  her  man.  Toshia  Mori  and  Eddie  Boland  both  splendid.    IF  you  want  the  experience  of  riding  a  de  luxe  train  from  Paris  to  Rome,  this  gives  it  superbly,  with  a  leisurely  melodrama  thrown  in.  Everyone  involved  in  a  murder  mystery  over  a  stolen  painting  restolen  on  the  train;  Conrad  Veidt  as  heavy  villain,  with  Donald  Calthrop  as  victim.  Esther  Ralston  and  Hugh  Williams  offer  mild  love  interest;  comic  relief  by  Gordon  Harker,  Finlay  Currie  and  Muriel  Aked.

William  Janney,  Wallace  Mac-  Donald  and  Dorothy  Appleby  are  simply  overshadowed  by  the  dynamic  Rex.    Exciting  both  for  youngsters  and  adults.    A  CROOK  tale  that,  curiously,  draws  its  chief  merit  from  a  comedy  bit  about  an  anchor,  applied  to  a  fair  captive  as  a  slave  bracelet.

I  was  at  the  New  York  end  and  Ramon  Novarro  held  the  Yuma  receiver.  Ramon's  birthday;  his  thirty-fourth,  I  believe.    The  date  was  February  6th.   "Hello,  Ramon.

"Do  you  really  want  to  know  or  is  this  a  social  call?"   "I  couldn't  afford  to  be  social  at  two  dollars  a  minute,  Ramon.  This  is  business.  I'll  take  it  off  my  income  tax."   "The  answer  is  yes  and  no.  My  contract  calls  for  acting,  directing  or  both.  As  the  years  go  on,  I  am  hoping  to  direct  more  and  act  less  often.  But  if  a  great  part  came  along  that  was  suitable  for  me,  I'd  probably  want  to  play  it.

Orry-Kellyhasput  hisinimitabletouchto  the  design  byusing  a  small  Peter  Pan  collar  with  bow  to  top  the  gown — it  is  one  of  those  gay  details  that  make  a  gown  different.  Pale  green  mousseline  de  soie  is  the  fabric  and  the  foundation  is  taffeta.  Note  the  tucked  detail  in  the  skirt  and  the  upper  part  of  the  bodice.  Although  Bette  is  not  wearing  it  in  this  picture,  there  is  a  tiny  sleeveless  jacket  with  a  three-tiered  cape  collar  to  go  with  this —  and  it  has  been  made  up  for  you  who  will  want  to  have  a  complete  evening  ensemble  for  early  summer  evenings.  Bette  wears  matching  satin  slippers  with  this  andsheerhose  with  a  coppery  cast.    Stripes  Are  New  In  Many  Guises    BLUE  and  white  striped  felt  fashions  a  say  quartette  of  new  accessories.  A  hat  in  the  smart  pillbox  shape,  a  belt  with  metal  buckle,  a  commodious  bag  with  leather  and  metal  trim  and  a    cigarette    case.      Stunning     for    either    spring    frock    or    suit.    COTTON  tweed  is  one  of  the  smartest  fabrics  for  sports-  wear or  daytime  this  season.  Bette  Davis  wears  the  one  above  in  "Ex-Lady."  Designed  by  Orry-Kelly,  it  has  a  detachable  cape,  buttoning  on  the  shoulder.  A  frayed  edge  of  the  fabric  is  used  for  trimming  on  cuffs  and  collar.    THE  redingote  type  of  costume  is  always  smart  for  spring  and  summer.  Bette  Davis  wears  this  one  on  her  Havana  trip  in  Ex-Lady."  Orry-Kelly  has  used  a  brown,  orange,  tan,  beige,  yellow  and  henna  stripe  on  white  for  the  silk  dress  and  for  the  cuffs  on  her  coat.  The  coat  is  yellow  wool  crepe  with  an  amusing  double  cape  and  unusual  collar  detail.  Note  the  stripe  again  repeated  on  the  buttons,  belt  buckle  and  hat  band.     Just  what  you  have  been  wanting,  isn't  it?    *~^&>Cf>?7ls01XSl*    i  jZLA    WHEN  Kay  Francis  appears  in  a  new  picture,  every  femi-  nine heart  has  an  excited  flutter  because  it  means  a  glittering  pa-  rade of  stunning  clothes.  Her  new  picture  "The  Keyhole"  will  prove  no  exception  for  Orry-  Kelly  has  done  a  knockout  job  of  designing  a  whole  wardrobe  of  grand  costumes.  One  is  this  evening  gown,  below.  Kay  wears  it  dining  and  dancing  in  the  south.  White  crepe  is  made  on  slim  lines  with  ruffles  used  for  a  deep  flounce  and  a  crisp  edging  for  the  neckline  in  front  and  back.  Note  how  the  pleated  ruffles  are  run  up  the  skirt  to  a  point.  Brass  rings  decorate  the  neckline  in  front  and  form  shoulder  straps  with  the  fabric  laced  through.  Kay  wears   two   brass  bracelets.    I/ATHARINE  HEPBURN  may  wear  patched  INtrousers  on  the  lot  but  she  wears  glamorous  clothes  for  her  screen  roles.  This  new  star  of  such  unique  personality,  wears  her  clothes  with  striking  effect.  In  "Christopher  Strong,"  she  wears  this  gown  designed  by  Howard  Greer.  Isn't  it  one  of  the  loveliest  you've  seen  with  fabric  daisies  forming  a  cape  and  flounce  on  white  mousseline  de  soie?  Each  daisy  has  a  rhinestone  center.'  The  cape  may  be  removed  when  and  if  you  wish.  Katharine  wears  this  in  a  highly  romantic  scene  in  the  picture,  at  a  party  on  the  Riviera.  There  is  one  scene  where  she  dances  with  the  hem  of  her  frock  held  up  in  one  hand — and  the  daisies  seem  to  fall  from  her  arms  down  to  the  hem  —  it  is   a    graceful   gown.    ~4    A  Nautical  Air    vening    HERE  are  two  views  of  a  different  gown!  It  has  a  sea-  faring air  with  its  sailor  collar  edged  with  braid  and  dotted  with  stars.  The  skirt,  too,  is  cleverly  suggestive  of  saiior  trousers  with  crystal  buttons  in  front  and  laced  detail  in  back.  Miriam  Jordan  wears  it  in  "Dangerously  Yours."  It  was  designed  by  Lambert  under  the  direction  of  Rita  Kaufman.  Heavy  white  crepe  is  the  fabric  with  stars  in  blue  and  braid   in  silver  and  white.     A  tab  in  front  has    lam  s    name    unique    THE  Keyhole"  brings  you  another  wearable  and  smart  costume.  It  is  a  coat,  part  of  an  ensemble  which  Orry-Kelly  has  designed  for  Kay  Francis.  Since  Kay  wears  it  on  a  boat  bound  for  Cuba,  her  model  is  white  flanne  but  it  has  been  made  up  in  a  new  woolen  for  your  spring  wardrobe.  The  coat  is  slightly  fitted,  fastening  with  one  large  button  at  the  front.  The  double  collar  so  unusual  in  design,  is  an  outstanding  detail.  Wide  flaring  cuffs  fasten  with  a  single  button.  Kay  wears  a  white  flannel  skirt  with  this  and  a  blue  and  white  striped  vest  of  mannish  type — the  striped  fabric  also  lines  her  coat.  All  white  accessories.    PLAIDS  are  very  much  in  the  spotlight  both  in  woolens  and  silks.  Mae  Clarke  wears  an  attractive  plaid  dress  in  "Parole  Girl."  A  large  bow  of  lacquered  silk  snaps  across  the  neckline  in  front.  Her  brown  leather  belt  is  trimmed  with  brass  knobs.  Don't  overlook  Mae's  trim  brown  straw  sailor  with  band  of  the  same  ribbon  that  forms  the  bow  on  her  dress — these  shallow  sailors  are  popular.    A  NUMBER  of  interesting  accessories  have  been  sketched  on  this  page.  Reading  from  top  to  bottom,  you  will  see  one  of  the  new  open  sandals  with  a  wide  T"  strap — perforated  trim  is  used  to  smart  advantage.  A  plaid  umbrella  offers  a  service  for  rainy  days — its  leather  handle  opens  up  to  reveal  a  pair  of  rubber  sandals  tucked  away  neatly  within!  A  black  leather  belt  affects  a  feminine  air  in  a  metal  bow.  And  the  newest  cigarette  holder  is  a  collapsible  affair  that  fits  into  a  small  case.  The  end    is   specially  constructed  to   eject  the  cigarette   stub.    ^eAprnsOT*-/L'    SLASHING  at  the  top  of  the  skirt  and  large  white  buttons  give  a  slightly  mannish  look  to  the  dress  above  which  Miriam  Jordan  wears  in  "Dangerously  Yours.''  This  costume  is  really  a  compromise  between  the  masculine  and  too  feminine — the  blouse  being  fashioned  of  a  red,  white  and  blue  star  print  with  soft  detailing  at  the  neckline.   A  CHECKED  cotton  shirt  like  a  man's  and  a  pique  vest  are   the   newest  accessory  contributions  to  the    man-tailored    vogue.     Note    the    fabric   shirt   tie.    FOR  country  or  city  wear,  corduroy  is  still  a  very  smart  choice.  In  "From  Hell  to  Heaven"  Adrienne  Ames  wears  the  attractive  ensemble  you  see  below.  She  wears  it  as  spectator  at  the  races — a  good  tip  for  you  who  will  be  going  to  such  events  this  spring.  Her  ensemble  is  gray  corduroy  for  the  skirt  and  swagger  coat,  plaid  flannel  in  yellow  and  black  for  the  tricky  little  blouse.  Large  nickel  buttons  and  a  nickel  buckle  on  the  suede  belt  dre  excel-  ent  touches  for  this  type  of  costume.  This  is  a  Travis  Banton  design.  Note  that  Adrienne  wears  a  beret  to  match  and  that  her  shoes  again  stress  the  perforated  detail  that  is  so  new.    Bert  Longworth    SHADES  of  Chandu!  But  no — this  concentrating  gentleman  from  the  much  misused  Far  East — he  who  wears  the  monstrous  turban  and  gases  so  fixedly  into  the  crystal  globe — is  no  other  than  Warren  William.  His  rapt  companion,  who  co'Stars  in  "The  Mind  Reader,"  is  Constance  Cummings.     Is  the  future  black,  gray  or  rosy,  Constance?    Let's  Give   T)olphe   A  Hand    I  SUPPOSE  if  you  asked  every  last  ham  in  Hollywood  who  the  most  unappreci-  ated actor  in  pictures  was,  he  would  point  to  his  fifth  weskit  button  and  roar,  ungrammatically  but  loudly,  "ME!"   Actors,  to  hear  them  tell  it,  are  never  properly  appreciated  at  their  full  value,  but  that  is  because  it  is  the  nature  of  the  histrionic  beast  (no  offense,  pals!)  never  to  be  satisfied  with  anything  but  the  best  end  seat  on  the  bus.   But  the  simple,  unadorned  truth  is  that  the  least  hymned  and   hallooed-for   trouper   in   all   Filmania   is   a   slender,  middle-aged  gent  who  goes  quietly  about  Hollywood  tending  strictly  to  his  tatting  and  who  answers  promptly  to  the  name  of  Adolphe  Menjou.   Dapper  'Dolphe  is  one  of  the  most  astonishing  phenomena  on  the  Once-Golden  Coast.  Deprived  of  his  tail-coated  stardom  at  Paramount  when  the  talkies  came  howling  in,  he  took  a  year's  exile  in  England  in  his  stride,  and  came  back  to  modest  feature  billing — and  one  grand  acting  job  after  another.  "  The  Front  Page,"  for  example.  And  take  the  case  of  "A  Farewell  to  Arms,"  with  Helen  Hayes  superb  as  the  war-battered  nurse,  and  Gary  Cooper  struggling  along  as  best  he  could  in  the  wake  of  that  appalling  little  genius.   But  when  the  polls  had  closed,  when  the  ballots  were  counted  — when  that  magnificent  picture  was  soberly  studied  and  its  performances  appraised — it  was  found  that  the  most  human,  the  most  sparkling  and  the  most  heart-warming  show  of  all  was  the  Rinaldi  of  Mr.  Adolphe  Menjou,  ex-tailors'  dummy  and  now  fine  actor-in-ordinary  to  the  magnates  of  Celluloidia.   In  short,  Mr.  Menjou  dangerously  approaches  greatness  as  an  actor.  Beneath  that  usually  debonair  exterior  beats  an  actor's  heart — glows  an  actor's  spirit.  He  can,  and  cheerfully  will,  give  half  a  dozen  such  spanking  performances  a  year.  Yet  when  the  statuettes  are  passed  around  by  the  Academy  of  Motion  Picture  Arts  and  Sciences,  nobody  ever  hands  old  Adolphe  one.  All  he  does,  you  see,  is  to  steal — and  save — the  other  folks'  talkies.   MONSIEUR  MENJOU'S  emergence  as  an  actor  of  truly  astounding  candle-power  is  one  of  those  Hollywood  hap-  penings that  keep  our  interest  in  pictures  at  white  heat —  sometimes  as  we  are  sinking  for  the  third  time  in  a  sea  of  ex-  quisite boredom.   For  years  nobody  ever  suspected  him  of  being  anything  much  but  a  very  handsome  Jigger  in  tails  and  topper.  Three  inches  added  to  his  waistline,  at  that  time,  would  have  knocked  his  picture  career  clear  to  Catalina  Island.   Chaplin  gave  him  his  first  big  shot  as  the  blase  man-about-town  in  "A  Woman  of  Paris,"  and  for  five  years  Monsieur  ambled  through  countless  Bored  Beauty  roles  without  his  mustache  once  becom-  ing unwaxed.  His  movie  life  was  one  long  drawl.   Perfect  in  its  way — yes,  but  Lord!  Certainly  there  was  something  more  to  life  than  a  melodious  lifting  of  the  left  eyebrow,  even  in  the  movies.  But  the  movies    still    only    moved,    and    when    Ever  since  Adolphe  Menjou  left  evening  clothes  for  real  acting  others  get  the  medals   By   Leonard   Hall    It's  just  as  we  always  suspected.  Beneath  that  silk  hat  there  was  hidden  a  great  actor.  Now  his  Doctor  Rinaldi  in  "A  Farewell  to  Arms"  proves  it — and  we're  for  seeing  a  lot  more  of  what  'Dolphe  can  do,  now  that  he's  in  the  open,  sans  cane,  spats  and  tailcoat    'Dolphe  was  in  'em,  hardly  that.  It  remained  for  the  scientists  with  their  talkie  gadgets  to  reveal  The  Duke  of  Hollywood  Boulevard  to  a  gasping  world  as  something  besides  The  Tailors'  Joy.   FINALLY  Adolphe  and  his  magnificent  haberdashery  got  to  be  a  sort  of  wistful  national  joke.  Columnists  hinted  that  he  was  sewed  into  his  tail-coat  in  1923  and  had  never  emerged  since —  that  he  slept  in  his  top  hat  and  wore  his  patent-leather  pumps  to  breakfast.  And  all  the  time,  under  that  spotless  iron  shirt,  beat  the  heart  of  a  first-rate  trouper!  How  little  we  know  of  what  really  goes  on  beneath  the  dinner-jackets  of  the  world!   For  M.  Menjou,  having  lived  down  his  iron-chest  era,  when  he  subdued  whole  battalions  of  crooning  women  by  a  flirt  of  the  snowy  'kerchief,  has  become  one  of  Hollywood's  chiefest  orna-  ments and  soundest  citizens.   True,  he  bellowed  a  bit  when  the  talkies  smote  him  from  stardom,  but  that  was  natural  enough — quite  "the  human  thin,^  to  do,"  as  the  old  catch  hath  it.  Once  back  in  harness,  however,  he  set  out  to  prove  to  the  bosses  and  the  pie-eyed  world  at  large  that  he  was  not  only  the  best  dress-tie  knotter  on  earth,  but  an  excellent  actor  as  well.   He  took  the  better  parts  that  were  tossed  his  way,  and  made  every  last  one  of  them  stand  out  and  shine.   His  career  has  reached  its  highest  point  today  with  his  glorious  Rinaldi  in  "A  Farewell  to  Arms,"  and  'Dolphe,  over  the  Greet  Divide  of  forty,  is  now  one  of  the  ac-  knowledged aces  of  motion  pictures.   Barring  an  occasional  mild  disagree-  ment with  his  beauteous  wife,  Kathryn  Carver,  which  unhappily  finds  its  way  into  the  daily  press,  Monsieur  Menjou's  Hollywood  existence  is  untroubled,  dignified  and  serene.  He  goes  on  from  triumph  to  triumph  in  his  gentlemanly  and  well-dressed  way,  and  he  will  have   [  PLEASE  TURN  TO  PAGE  93  ]    67    What  was  the    BEST  PICTURE  OF  1932?    Your  Votes  Decide   Which  One  Shall  Be  Added  To  This  Famous  Photoplay  Honor  Roll!    ONCE    more    voting    time    has  come — the  time  to  select  what-  ever picture  of  the  1932  list  de-  serves the  highest  honor  accorded  in  photoplay  land.   Other  fields  have  their  Nobel  prizes,  their  Pulitzer  awards.  Mo-  tion pictures  too  have  honors,  awarded  by  critics,  artists  and  pro-  fessionals. But  the  supreme  honor,  the  final  verdict,  is  the  one  that  you,  the  millions  of  the  picture  audience,  award.  Each  year  you  decide  by  your  votes,  which  picture  is  to  be  declared  the  best  of  the  year  just  passed,  and  given  the  Gold  Medal  donated  by  Photoplay.  This  medal  is  made  of  solid  gold,  weighing  1233^2  pennyweights.  It  is  two  and  one-  half  inches  in  diameter,  designed  by  Tiffany  and  Company,  New  York.   At  the  right  are  the  choices  so  made  in  previous  years.  Now  it  is  time  to  add  1932's  contribution  to  this  honor  roll;  and  time  for  you  to  prepare  for  doing  your  part  in  this  great  annual  election.   No  rules,  no  limitations,  restrict  you.  All  we  ask  is  that  you  think  carefully,  consider  well,  then  send  us  your  decision.  And  the  picture  receiving  the  greatest  number  of  votes  between  now  and  when  the  poll  closes,  will  be  adjudged  best  and  awarded  the  Medal.   In  making  your  choice,  outstand-  ing work  by  one  or  more  stars,  of    course  will  count,  and  count  heavily.  But  you  will  remember  the  support-  ing players — did  they  fit  in  natur-  ally, effectively?  The  direction — did  it  get  the  most  possible  from  players  and  plot?  Settings  and  stagings,  photography — and  of  course  the  story  itself.  And  the  best  test — the  one  on  which  we  feel  sure  you'll  rely  in  the  end — is  the  test  of  how  well  the  picture  wears  with  you,  as  you  think  back  to  it,  and  compare  it  with  others  you  see.   To  aid  you  in  recollecting  which  were  the  pictures  of  1932,  we  print  a  list  below;  but  your  choice  is  not  limited  to  those  in  this  list.  If  you  consider  some  other  picture  superior,  and  it  was  released  in  1932,  you  are  perfectly  free  to  vote  for  it.   One  other  point:  While  the  picture  must  be  one  released  in  1932,  you  need  not  have  seen  it  in  that  year.  If  you  saw  it  this  year,  that  is  quite  all  right.  The  Brief  Reviews  com-  mencing on  page  6  of  this  issue,  will  help  for  the  last  few  months  of  the  year.   If  the  picture  was  reviewed  in  Jan-  uary, 1933,  or  earlier,  it  was  certainly  a  1932  release.   For  your  convenience,  a  voting  coupon  is  printed  in  the  lower  right-  hand  corner  of  this  page,  but  a  letter  or  post  card  will  do  as  well.  Your  vote  is  what  counts,  however  you  send  it.

If  this  sudden  vogue  for  mannishness  takes,  it  is  hoped  that  girls  will  first  consider  their  type  seriously.     For  it  can  be  either  very  chic  or  ridiculous.

Those  longitudinal  curls  give  much  latitude  for  their  arrangement  if  you  can  possibly  produce  enough  hair  to  create  them.     Coronet  effect  is  becoming  to  a  full  face.    Nice  dimples!    THELMA  can  well  I  afford  to  turn  her  back  on  us  with  a  ravishing  coiffure  like  this.  From  a  low  right  part  the  slightly  waved  hair  is  swept  to  the  left,  where  it  is  massed  in  full  curls  of  geometric  design.   70    Casin  Roll   Coiffure   Created  For   ThelmaTodd    THE  left  side  has  full  benefit  of  I  curl.

Beauti-  ^>uul,  glamorous,  disillusioned,  they  set  new  precedents  in  beauty.  Notice  how  clever  make-  up accentuates  the  outer  lashes,  leaving  the  inner  lashes  almost  untouched.   This  adds  subtle  charms.    MAE  CLARKE,  whose  eyes  are  dark,  oval  and  of  normal  size,  finds  that  an  even  fringe  of  dark  lashes  above  and  below  is  becom-  ing to  her  type.  Wet  your  brush,  brush  on  the  darkener,  separating  the  lashes  with  the  brush,  to  make  a   natural- looking   frame  for  eyes.    I/ATHLEEN  BURKE  has   •^decidedly  almond  shaped  eyes.  This  type  should  brush  on  darkener  ightly,  accenting  the  out-  er lashes  heavily  to  em-  phasize the  slant  and  ex-  otic effect.  Forheavy lash-  es, brush  on  a  second  coat  after  the  first  has  dried.    WITH  auburn  hair  and  hazel  eyes,  Lilian  Bond  finds  a  heavy  fringe  on  the  upper  lid,  a  slight  accent  to  the  lower,  a  proper  finishing  touch  to  her  eyes.  This  procedure  applies  to  most  light  eyes.  Always  shadow  lower  lashes     very     discreetly.   71    Photoplay  Magazine  for  April    ••1Ylf  #»m  a  man  begins  to  take  you  for  granted,  took  out!

Everyone  wants  to  know  if  she  is  really  as  feroci-  ous as  her  name  implies.  Let  me  tell  you  about  her.   Her  real  name  is  Kathleen  Burke  and  she  is  nineteen  years  old.  Was  born  in  Hammond,  Indiana,  although  Chicago  has  been  getting  the  credit  for  her  discovery.  She  is  5  feet,  6  inches  tall;  weighs  118  pounds  and  has  brown  hair  and  brown  eyes.   Before  she  won  the  title  of  "Panther  Woman"  in  a  nation-wide  contest  in  which  60,000  other  ambitious  aspirants  took  part,  she  was  an  advertising  copy-writer  and  photog-  rapher's model.  She  never  had  any  stage  or  screen  experience.  She  claims  it  was  her  "Irish  Luck"  that  helped  her  win,  but  it  was  really  her  eyes— long,  narrow,  blazing  eyes  that  slant  strangely  at  the  corners.   When  Kathleen  went  to  Hollywood,  her  fiance,  Glen  R.  Rardin,  a  Chicago  photog-  rapher, closed  up  his  shop  and  followed  her.  The  studio  objected  to  Glen  playing  body-  guard and  hanging  around  while  Kathleen  emoted,  but  a  little  of  the  "Panther"  spirit  flared  up  and  Glen  was  allowed  to  remain.   In  her  latest  picture  "Murders  in  the  Zoo"  Kathleen  plays  an  entirely  different  role  from  Lola  in  "The  Isle  of  Lost  Souls."   Shirley  Cramer,  Hixsdale,  III. — Tell  me  more  about  that  club  of  yours,  Shirley.  And  so  that  all  will  be  peaceful  at  your  next  meeting,  here's  the  information.  Bette  Davis'  first  name  is  pronounced  as  though  it  were  spelled  "  Betty."  The  story  goes,  that  when  she  was  a  little  tyke  just  starting  at  school,  teacher  asked  her  to  write  her  name.  She  obliged  with  "  Bette,"  and  her  folks  thought  it  so  cute  they  left  it  that  way.    P.  D.  Q.,  Eureka,  Calif. — Don't  be  timid  about  asking  questions.  I'm  always  glad  to  be  of  assistance  to  my  friends.  Joel  McCrea  is  6  feet,  2  inches  tall  and  has  been  in  this  merry  old  world  for  27  years.  You  will  see  him  next  opposite  Ann  Harding  in  "Declasse."  You  didn't  tell  me  your  height  so  how  can  I  tell  you  just  what  actress  reaches  the  same  altitude?  Aline  MacMahon  is  5  feet,  8  inches  tall.  Does  that  beat  your  record?   C.  Champe  Taliaferro,  Wilmington,  Del. — Have  you  a  bet  on  the  picture  you  described  to  me?  The  name  of  it  was  "Lovers  Courageous,"  Madge  Evans  and  Robert  Mont-  gomery playing  the  leading  roles.   Birdie,  Detroit,  Mich. — You're  right,  Birdie,  that  was  a  very  lovely  melody  played  by  Katharine  Hepburn  and  John  Barrymore  in  "A  Bill  of  Divorcement."  It  was  an  original  composition  by  Max  Steiner  and  is  published  by  Sam  Fox,  158  West  46th  Street,  New  York  City.    The  name  is  "An  Unfinished  Sonata."   Carroll  Fox,  Baltimore,  Md. — Carroll,  you  win  the  bet.  Maurice  Chevalier  is  a  native^  son  of  France.  Imagine  your  friend  thinking  he  was  a  Brooklynite!  Maurice  came  to  America  in  1928.  His  latest  picture  is  "A  Bed-  time Story."  Helen  Twelvetrees  and  Leah  Ray  appear  with  him.   Scottyfoot,  Dayton,  Ohio. — Joan  Craw-  ford will  celebrate  her  twenty-fifth  birthday  on  March  23rd.  Dorothy  Jordan  uses  her  own  name  in  pictures.  Sorry  I  cannot  give  you  her  home  address.   Mrs.  Dewttt,  Sacramento,  Calif. — John  Halliday  entered  pictures  early  in  1930  after    a  very  successful  stage  career.  He  appeared  on  the  stage  in  "Dracula,"  "The  Spider,"  and  "Jealousy."  Among  the  numerous  pictures  he  has  appeared  in  are  "Captain  Applejack,"  "Father's  Son,"  "Impatient  Maiden,"  "Bird  of  Paradise,"  and  "The  Age  of  Consent."  He  also  went  to  Europe  in  1932  and  appeared  in  Gloria  Swanson's  British-made  picture  "Per-  fect Understanding."  John's  latest  is  "The  Woman  Accused."  He  is  a  Brooklynite,  born  on  September  14,  1886.  In  March,  1929,  he  and  Eleanor  Griffith  were  married.   Margaret  Browning,  Alhahbra,  Callf. —  How  did  you  ever  get  your  choice  sifted  down  to  one  when  there  are  so  many  handsome  leading  men?  Robert  Young  was  born  in  Chicago  on  Washington's  birthday,  1907.  He  is  6  feet,  1  inch  tall;  weighs  170  and  has  brown  hair  and  brown  eyes.  Received  his  grammar  school  education  in  Seattle  and  went  to  high  school  in  Los  Angeles.  Entered  pictures  in  March,  1931.  His  favorite  sport  is  golf  and  his  latest  picture  is  "Today  We  Live."   Mrs.  Jack  Thiebanth,  Stratford,  Coxx.  — Sure,  you  have  seen  Gertrude  Messinger  before.  Remember  her  in  the  "boy  friend"  series  made  by  Hal  Roach?  Gertie  was  born  in  Spokane,  Wash.,  on  April  28,  1911.  She  is  5  feet  tall  and  weighs  100  pounds.  Has  blonde  hair  and  blue  eyes.  At  the  age  of  4  years  she  appeared  in  Fox  kiddie  pictures.  On  April  20,  1932,  she  eloped  with  David  Sharpe,  who  appeared  with  her  in  the  "boy  friend"  series.  Buddy  Messinger  is  her  brother.   J.  M.  P.,  Upper  Moxtclatr,  N.  J. — None  other  than  Gary  Cooper  played  opposite  Colleen  Moore  in  "Lilac  Time."    Photoplay  Magazine  for  April,  1933    Th    ose    Marked    what  will   they   tell  you?    IS      THE      FEAR      OF      THEM      SHATTERING      YOUR      HEALTH?    Many  eminent  physicians  have  declared  that  fear  often  acts  on  the  system  like  a  poison,  creating  a  toxic  condition  that  is  particularly  disturbing  to  the  delicate  feminine  organism.   When  women  watch  the  calendar,  month  after  month,  with  anxiety  and  apprehen-  sion, this  very  worry,  in  itself,  often  causes  feminine  irregularities  and  ill-  health.   Why  not  banish  "calendar  fear"?  Why  not  follow  the  lead  of  millions  of  women  who  are  safeguarding  health,  youth  and  feminine-daintiness  by  prac-  ticing correct  and  sensible  hygiene?   They  use  the  "Lysol"  method  of  femi-    nine antisepsis  that  has  been  approved  by  leading  doctors  throughout  the  world,  for  more  than  forty  years.   "Lysol"  is  mild  and  healing.  It  contains  no  free  caustic  alkali,  commonly  found  in  chlorine-type  antiseptics,  which  dead-  ens sensitive  tissues  and  inflames  tender  membranes.   "Lysol"  is  dependable  and  effective.  It  destroys  germ-life  in  the  actual  presence  of  organic  matter  .  .  .  Under  similar  con-  ditions, certain  chlorine  compounds  lose  95%  of  their  laboratory  efficiency.   Don't  let  "calendar  fear"  run  away  with  your  good  looks  . . .  and  your  good  health.  Practice  intimate  feminine    cleanliness.  Lse  "Lysol"  according  to  directions.

She  takes  hers  from  a  spray.  Try  an  ordinary  atomizer.  Also  a  delightfully  refreshing  and  stimulating  way  to  use  lotions.    LILIAN  HARVEY,  whom  many  of  you  saw  in  "Congress  Dances"  and  who  will  soon  be  on  the  screen  in  American-  made  pictures,  is  a  very  petite  and  prettyperson.  In  conversation  one  day  this  actress  said  to  me,  "In  two  years  I  have  been  seven  days  without  professional  make-up  on  my  face."   Coming  from  a  player  whose  appearance  is  of  paramount  importance,  whose  skin  is  deli-  cate and  fine  and  flawless,  this  statement  should  ease  the  minds  of  many  girls  who  write  to  this  department  questioning  the  use  of  make-up.  Does  it  harm,  can  it  harm,  could  it  be  responsible  for  this  or  that  little  skin  ail-  ment from  which  the  writer  suffers?   When  Lilian  referred  to  make-up,  she  meant  that  heavy,  masque-like  make-up  that  all  screen  players  use  so  that  the  camera  can  bring  out  the  right  skin,  hair  and  feature  con-  trasts and  tones.  She  did  not  refer  to  the  delicate,  protective  powders,  the  finely  com-  pounded rouges  and  flattering  and  soothing  lipsticks  that  most  of  us  use.   From  long  and  keen  observation  I  should  say  that  the  girl  who  uses  make-up  invariably  hasafar better  skin  than  the  girl  who  does  not.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this.  Only  the  girl  interested  in  her  appearance  uses  make-up.  In  many  cases,  she  is  just  as  interested  in  her  own  skin  health.  Naturally,  this  means  that  she  cleanses  thoroughly  and  uses  sane  judg-  ment in  the  selection  of  her  preparations.   Secondly,  any  girl  with  two  bright  eyes  knows  that  make-up  to  be  artful  and  attractive  must  be  fresh — and  we  cannot  pile  new  make-  up over  old  without  looking  dull  and  sodden.  Lipstick,  no  matter  how  fresh  and  vivid  in   78    WITH  April  comes  the  de-  sire for  new  and  lovely  perfumes,  and  so  I  have  pre-  pared a  folder,  "New  Per-  fumes and  How  to  Use  Them."  It's  yours  on  request,  as  well  as  our  folder  on  "Hair  That  Mis-  behaves," our  list  of  beauty  preparations  for  every  skin  and  a  leaflet  devoted  to  acne  and  blackhead  conditions.

TWO    noteworthy    details  of  Carole  Lombard's  face  that    beauty-mark   and  broader  eyebrows.     There  is  a  distinct  Hollywood  trend  toward    broader    eyebrows.    tone,  will  look  harsh  and  dead  if  layer  is  placarded  over  layer.  And  so  we  make-up  users  invariably  cleanse  our  faces  oftener  than  the  girl  who  goes  without.   Fully  half  of  our  skin  health  and  beauty  is  dependent  upon  these  frequent  cleansings.  We  need  not,  of  course,  go  through  the  thorough  routine  of  a  soap-and-water  bath  or  cream-  and-lotion  cleansing  every  time  we  need  fresh  make-up.  They  are  our  morning  and  evening  skin  salvation.  For  quick  and  perfect  removal  of  make-up  during  the  day,  use  one  of  the  modern  liquid  cleansers  which  also  serves  as  a  good  powder  base.  Renew  your  make-up  at  least  once  a  day,  preferably  at  noon.  This  attention  will  do  wonders  for  your  skin  and  give  you  the  fullest  charm  and  benefit  from   your  make-up.   *  *       *   Lillian  Rosine,  make-up  expert,  recently  talked  at  a  bankers'  convention  and  extended  to  the  audience  the  privilege  of  asking  ques-  tions. Garbo's  lashes  and  Harlow's  hair  came  in  for  much  questioning,  showing  how  these  players'  charms  affect  the  male  movie-  goers.   *  *       *   Una  Merkel,  a  little  bird  tells  us,  grew  very  weary  of  her  long  tresses  and  had  her  golden  blonde,  curly  hair  cut  quite  short.  The  last  time  I  saw  Una  she  was  in  the  long-haired  class  and  some  of  you  may  remember  that  we  showed  her  in  this  department  brushing  for  hair  beauty.  This  masculine  vogue  may  send  some  of  you  to  the  barber,  but  do  retain  a  few  curls  or  a  bang  even  if  you  go  very  short.

And  that  reminds  me,  when  you  girls  drink  tea — either  hot  or  cold — be  sure  to  squeeze  eight  or  ten  drops  of  lemon  juice  into  it  because  that  neutralizes  the  tannic  acid.  Tannic  acid  is  bad  for  the  liver.   How  did  I  reduce  Carole  Lombard  from  a  sixteen  to  a  twelve?  I'll  tell  you.  For  two  hours  every  day  I  pounded  and  squeezed  and  slapped  that  flesh  away.  You  can  do  the  same  for  yourself  if  you  will.  You  see,  the  ordinary  massage  is  only  good  for  putting  flesh  on.  By  my  method  the  flesh  is  squeezed  off  with  the  fingers  and  slapped  off  with  the  hands.   And  here's  something  else  I  did  to  take  off  flesh  from  just  below  the  busts  to  the  knee.  I  stretched  her.  Yes,  that's  just  what  I  mean.  And  here's  how  you  can  do  that.  Lie  on  a  bed  and  with  the  right  hand  hold  on  tight  to  the  bed-post.  Then  get  a  friend  or  your  husband  or  your  mother  or  someone  to  pull  the  right  leg  (holding  the  leg  at  the  knee)  as  hard  as  he  or  she  can.  Make  the  person  helping  you  pull  hard  and  you  hang  on  to  the  bed-post  hard,  too,  stretching  as  much  as  you  can  the  entire  time.   This  stretching  will  actually  pull  fat  away.  It  goes  deeper  into  the  fat  cells  than  the  hand  can  reach.  It's  marvelous,  but  you've  got  to  be  able  to  take  it.  You've  got  to  pull  upwards  while  the  person  helping  you  pulls  down.  Then  do  the  same  thing  with  the  left  side,  holding  with  the  left  hand  and  having  the  left  leg  pulled.  You  won't  mind  that  kind  of  leg  pull-  ing, for  you'll  know  it's  taking  off  those  pounds.    As  soon  as  Carole  had  her  treatment  she  was  as  lively  as  a  baby.  She  was  just  nothing  but  a  big  kid  then!  For  besides  the  pounding,  squeezing,  pulling  and  pinching,  I  always  worked  on  her  back  and  the  back  of  her  shoulders.  You  can  do  that,  too.  With  your  two  hands  dig  under  the  muscles  at  the  back  of  your  neck,  across,  reaching  over  the  back  of  your  shoulders  and  as  far  down  around  the  spine  as  you  can.  And  will  that  give  you  pep!  Carole  used  to  jump  up  from  my  treating  table  and  dance  around  like  a  kid— just  because  she  felt  so  good!  You'll  feel  lively,  too,  when  you've  worked  on  your  back  that  way — and  the  more  weight  you  lose,  the  livelier  you'll  feel.  Here  is  a  sample  day's  menu  in  Carole  Lombard's  diet:   Breakfast   Small  glass  orange  juice  Small  glass  of  water   One  slice  whole  wheat  toast  with  a  tiny  bit  of  butter  Coddled  egg  Coffee — black   I  let  her  have  the  coddled  egg  if  she  had  a  hard  day's  work  ahead.  You  probably  know  how  to  prepare  a  coddled  egg,  but  in  case  you  don't:  Bring  some  water  to  a  boil.  Turn  off  the  gas.  Put  the  egg  in  the  water  without  breaking  it  and  let  it  stand  for  eight  or  ten  minutes.     That's  the  best  way  to  cook  eggs.    Luncheon   Glass  tomato  juice  Y<i  head  of  lettuce  Whole  sliced  tomato  French  dressing — mostly  lemon  juice  Dish  of  gelatin — with  a  spoonful  of   thin  coffee  cream  Iced  tea   You  see,  I  gave  her  plenty  of  food  that  would  produce  red  blood.  For  I  know  what  the  lack  of  red  blood  will  do — cause  anemia.   Mid-Afternoon   Tomato  or  orange  juice   Dinner   Small  bunch  of  celery   Two  lamb  chops   Skin  of  a  baked  potato   Two  tablespoons  small  green  lima  beans   Four  tablespoons  steamed  carrots  (wonderful  for  the  complexion)   A  very,  very  little  prune  whip  (Carole  loved  that)   Demi-tasse   I  give  plenty  of  food  on  my  diets,  as  you  can   see.     But  what  I  tried  to  teach  Carole  and   what  I  want  to  teach  you  girls,  too,  is  that  you   must  karn  to  choose  food  that  is  non-fattening.   [  please  turn  to  page  107  ]    Answers  by  Sylvia    REDUCING  Dear  Sylvia:   I  have  a  large  stomach.  I  wish  you  would  tell  me  how  to  reduce  it.  I  have  been  wearing  a  girdle  for  the  past  two  years.   B.  G.  M.,  Clifton,  N.  J.   Lie  on  the  floor,  face  down  with  your  arms  above  your  head  and  your  feet  straight,  resting  your  body  on  your  stomach.  Now  roll  from  side  to  side  and  also  progress  along  the  floor,  hitching  yourself  along  as  you  go.  Go  back  and  forth  across  the  floor  like  this  five  times  a  day.  Be  sure  that  your  weight  is  all  on  your  stomach.  Why,  you  can  just  feel  the  fat  cells  being  smashed  off.  It's  hard — but  it  will  do  the  trick.  Don't  eat  bulky  food.  Don't  drink  much  water.  Don't  drink  sweet  milk.  Butter-  milk is  fine  for  you.  Drink  plenty  of  tomato  juice  and  orange  and  grapefruit  juice.   Dear  Sylvia:   My  trouble  is  with  a  lump  on  my  hip  bone.  It  is  not  just  fat,  but  muscle  as  well.  I  am  fol-  lowing your  diet  but  I  get  very  hungry  about  four  o'clock.  Is  it  all  right  to  take  a  tomato  juice  cocktail  or  glass  of  orange  juice  then?  P.  L.  S.,  Dearborn,  Mich.   That  lump  can  be  squeezed  off  with  the  hands.  Take  the  lump  of  flesh  in  your  hands  and  squeeze — hard ! — then  let  the  flesh  sort  of  ooze  through  the  fingers  like  mashed  potatoes.  Then  cover  the  flesh  with  a  Turkish  towel  and  pound,  with  the  palm  of  your  hand,  as  if  you  were  pounding  somebody  you  hated.  Hit —  and  hit  good  and  hard.  Declare  war  on  that  lump  of  fat.  Do  this  a  half  hour  a  day.  Muscle  is  very  stubborn  but  it  positively  will  come  off  if  you  squeeze  and  pound  hard  enough.  By  all  means,  take  the  tomato  juice  or  orange  juice  at  four.    It's  good  for  you.   80    AND  the  letters  still  pour  in!  Poor  Aunt  SYLVIA  is  about  snowed  under.  But  I  told  you  I  would  answer  all  your  personal  problems  and  I'm  going  to  do  just  that.  You've  got  to  have  a  little  patience,  however — and  remember  this:  Letters  that  have  a  stamped,  self  addressed  envelope  at-  tached will  get  a  personal  reply.  Others  will  be  answered  on  these  pages — and  you'll  have  to  wait  your  turn.  Okay,  girls,  here  goes!   Sylvia    Dear  Madame  Sylvia:   I'll  bet  that  my  case  is  a  lot  different  from  most  of  the  ones  you've  had.  Did  you  ever  hear  of  a  girl  being  too  muscular?  I'd  like  to  come  into  your  fold,  but  what  can  I  do  about  it?   D.  D.,  Oak  Park,  111.   Listen,  baby,  I've  heard  of  and  have  treated  every  sort  of  woman.  Of  course,  I've  heard  of  muscular  girls — and  have  taken  down  those  muscles.  Constance  Cummings  was  that  type.  And  in  the  March  issue  of  Photoplay  I  told  just  exactly  the  routine  to  follow.  It  helped  Connie  and  it  will  help  you.  If  you  haven't  already  seen  it,  you  can  get  a  copy  by  writing  to  the  Photoplay  offices  in  Chicago — 919  North  Michigan  Avenue.  Back  copies  are  twenty-five  cents.   Dear  Miss  Sylvia:   I  have  been  in  bed  nearly  three  years  curing  tuberculosis  and  am  now  nearly  well  and  plan-  ning to  leave  the  sanitarium.  Have  gained  nearly  twenty-five  pounds  and,  naturally,  having  acquired  this  while  lying  in  bed,  I  have  become  quite   flabby.     My  bust   is  overde-    veloped and  flabby.    Could  you  tell  me  how  to  correct  this.   B.  L.,  Cresson,  Penna.   I'm  glad  you  wrote  that  letter.  The  answer  goes  for  you  as  well  as  all  other  tubercular  patients — and  lots  of  them  write  to  me.  You  tubercular  people  should  be  grateful  for  the  extra  weight.  Didn't  you  fight  hard  enough  in  the  Sanitarium  to  gain  it?  And  remember  this  — as  soon  as  you  are  up  and  walking  around  it  is  natural  for  the  flesh  to  tighten  up.  For  heaven's  sake,  don't  do  anything  except  just  what  your  doctor  tells  you!  Wait  six  months  to  get  your  sea  legs — and  then  write  me  your  troubles.  Right  now  you  should  just  be  grate-  ful that  you're  cured!   Dear  Madame  Sylvia:   I  wish  you  would  give  me  information  on  re-  ducing the  bust.  I  am  on  a  very  strict  diet  at  the  present  time.   K.  G.,  Lewisburg,  Penna.   If  the  diet  you're  on  is  for  some  physical  ail-  ment I'm  afraid  I  can't  help  you.  My  butter-  milk diet — which  I  have  given  several  times —  reduces  the  bust.  Here's  the  buttermilk  diet.  For  three  days  drink  a  glass  of  buttermilk  every  two  hours — and  nothing  else.  Then  for  three  days  eat  normally,  but  not  too  much.  Repeat  until  the  bust  is  the  size  you  want.  But  remember — don't  think  of  trying  any  experi-  ments if  your  diet  is  being  prescribed  for  any  ailment.  Stay  with  what  you're  doing  until  the  job's  done.

A  T  last — the  big  girls  are  getting  a  break  *     in  Hollywood.   Over  on  "The  Warrior's  Husband"  set  is  mobilized  every  tall  and  buxom  dame  in  Hollywood  for  the  Amazon  army,  commanded  by  Marjorie  Rambeau.  The  army  is  dressed  in  short  tunics  of  metal  cloth,  with  yards  and  yards  of  bare  leg  below.  Hardly  a  girl  on  the  set  is  under  six  feet  tall.   82    Walter  Lang,  the  director,  was  having  trouble  keeping  the  names  of  some  hundred  Amazon  ladies  straight.   He  wanted  to  speak  to  one,  and  baffled  momentarily,  called  out,  "Miss  .  .  .  ah  .  .  .  I  mean  the  girl  with  the  blushing  legs  over  there.  .  .  ."   T_TELEN  HAYES  has  a  pretty  good  idea  what  casting  directors  think  of  her.  And  how  much  chance  she'd  have  getting  into  the  movies,  if  they  did  the  choosing.  When  Helen  first  arrived  in  Hollywood  from  New  York,  with  a  contract  in  her  pocket,  she  determined  to  see  just  how  she  rated  as  a  movie  actress.  She  went  to  each  and  every  casting  office  in  town,  told  who  she  was  and  asked  fora  job.  Every  last  one  of  them  turned  her  down.  And  was  Helen  thankful  for  the  contract  in  her  pocket.   A/T ARLENE  DIETRICH  was  chatting  with  Cora  Sue  Collins  at  lunch-time.

"I'll  bet  a  big  girl  like  you  knows  how  to  make  toast,"  suggested  Marlene,  who  loves  to  hear  Cora  Sue  talk.   "Yeth  Ma'am,  I  do,"  informed  Cora  Sue.

TT'S  a  good  thing  Frank  Morgan  isn't  super-  stitious.   He  has  had  to  break  innumerable  mirrors  for  "The  Kiss  Before  the  Mirror"  (no,  silly,  not  by  looking  in  them!)   He  broke  one  of  his  own  personal  mirrors  in  a  make-up  box  the  day  he  arrived  in  Holly-  wood, and  it  must  have  been  a  good  break.  Frank  has  been  going  strong  ever  since.   In  other  words,  Mr.  Morgan  does  it  with  mirrors.   QALAMITY  NOTE  ...  Joe  E.

Yon,  who  was  then  Joe  Stern,  a  film  cutter,  told  the  actor  that  he  had  great  expectations  for  himself.  He  had  a  formula  all  worked  out,  by  which  he  intended  to  achieve  fame  and  fortune.   "I  am  going  to  make  people  hate  me,"  said  Von.  "When  they  hate  you,  they  re-  member and  respect  you."   An  ignoble  ambition — notably  successful.

For  Buster  plays  a  sort  of  Tarzan,  and  in  the  picture  his  "booful  tummy"  is  just  as  important  as  the  rest  of  him.  Who-  ever heard  of  a  wild  jungle  guy  with  an  appendicitis  scar  showing  on  his  stomach?   So  Buster  just  had  to  hold  his  tummy  until  the  picture  was  finished.  Which  ought  to  teach  him  to  wear  some  clothes  next  time.   T^ATE  SMITH  is  still  trying  to  figure  this  one  out.   When  her  train,  en  route  east,  reached  Kansas  City,  a  member  of  the  crew  said:   "Well,  we  finally  got  over  the  mountain — but  it  took  two  engines."

For  that  reason  the  name  of  her  four-year-  old  daughter  has  been  changed  from  Adrienne  to  Diana.   Originally  named  for  Joan's  mother,  the  child  manifested  a  dislike  for  Adrienne  as  she  grew  older.   She  preferred  Diana.  Why?  The  reason  is  not  quite  clear.  In  any  event,  from  now  on,  says  Joan,  it  will  be  Diana.   TT  looks  like  a  double  romance  and  a  double  wedding  for  Hollywood  soon.

[  PLEASE  TURN  TO  PAGE  1 14  ]    Photoplay  Magazine  for  April,  1933    Fulfillment  of  a  Wink    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  58  ]   is  not  at  the  present  time  working  on  his  screen  swan  song-   This  ought  to  bring  instant  relief  to  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Novarro  fans.   I  am  one  of  them.  I  have  known  Ramon  for  twelve  years.   His  advent  on  the  old  Metro  lot  along  about  1921  caused  a  swishing  of  skirts  and  fluttering  of  eyelids  that  not  even  Valentino  could  stir  up.   Imagine,  we  had  them  both  under  the  same  roof  then.   Ramon  was  wearing  his  Rupert  of  Hcnlzau  uniform.   A  dashing,  devil-may-care  fellow.  Poetry  in  every  move  of  his  body.   But  there  was  more  than  poetry  in  his  eye.   IT'S  that  look  in  young  Xovarro's  eye  that  I've  been  thinking  about.  It  suggested  an  immense  enthusiasm  for  living.  It  combined  suspense  with  what  we  later  came  to  know  as  "It."   One  day  I  saw  him  play  a  scene  as  Rupert  in  "The  Prisoner  of  Zenda. "  During  the  making  of  it,  he  flashed  the  naughtiest  wink  in  all  Christendom.   But  somewhere  along  the  line  something  happened  to  that  tantalizing  look  in  twenty-  two-year-old  Ramon's  eye.  Something  grad-  ually obscured  it.   He  continued  to  be  poetic,  romantic  and  spiritual  in  turn.  But  that  humorous  dignity  which  he  could  give  to  a  naughty  role,  that  jocular  semi-ruffian  quality,  got  lost  in  the  shuffle.   Shortly  before  Rex  Ingram  engaged  Ramon  for  "The  Prisoner  of  Zenda,"  I  had  seen  him  in  a  stage  production  of  a  pantomimic  tiling  at  a  tiny  theater  in  Holly-wood.  It  was  called  "A  Spanish  Fandango.''   I  recall  nothing  of  it  now  but  the  extra-  ordinarily beautiful  performance  of  Ramon.  I  am  again  reminded  of  what  Rex  Ingram  said  of  him.   "He  has  the  physique  of  Michelangelo's  David  and  the  face  of  an  El  Greco  Don. "   What  he  failed  to  add  was  the  most  delight-  ful ingredient  in  a  devastating  combination.  Ramon  has  a  superb  sense  of  humor,  and  an  equally  lusty  delight  in  practical  jokes.   Only  once,  a  few  years  after  Ramon  had  achieved  success,  did  that  earlier  fire  re-kindle  itself.   It  was  during  a  social  evening.   Ramon  and  I  attended  the  same  dinner  party  given  by  a  mutual  friend.  As  the  evening  drew  to  a  close,  someone  asked  him  to  sing  for  us.   There  began  a  most  thrilling  time  for  every-  one present.  Ramon  sang.  Mexican  songs.  Spanish  songs,  English  songs!  His  English  was  more  imperfect  then  than  now  but  not  less  intriguing  to  the  ear.  He  played  the  piano.  He  played  the  guitar.   Then,  in  order  to  illustrate  the  meaning  of  one  of  the  slightly  risque  songs,  he  took  off  his  shoes  and  danced  it  for  us.   AXD  how  he  danced!  All  the  fire  and  quest  of  life  was  there.   It  was  poetry,  but  it  was  imagination  and  passion,  too.   The  quality  I  had  been  missing  from  his  screen  work  was  apparently  not  missed  by  anyone  else,  however.   Ramon  has  done  what  everyone  will  tell  you  cannot  be  done.   He  has  held  his  first-won  popularity  with  the  public  on  an  even  keel  for  over  ten  years.   His  pictures  during  that  time,  except  for  a  few  specials,  have  not  been  good  enough  to  serenade  nor  bad  enough  to  castigate.   His  publicity  has  been  meager  or  repetitious.

The  only  time  he  drew  a  front  page  headline  he  scarcely  deserved  it.  Through  indulging  in  a  playful  wrestling  bout  with  Elsie  Janis  at  Grace  Tibbett's  home,  he  became  good  copy  for  days.   You  see,  Elsie's  arm  was  slightly  put  out  of  joint  in  the  scuffle.   His  popularity  in  Europe  is  hardly  less  than  Garbo's.     His  fan  mail  is  prodigious.   ft's  a  remarkable  record.  But  then.  Ramon  is  in  many  ways  a  remarkable  fellow.   Then  suddenly,  a  couple  of  years  ago.  the  magazines  were  flooded  with  stories  of  the  "changed"  Xovarro.   That  was  a  lot  of  the  well-known  apple  sauce.   "D  AMOX  had  not  changed.  He  is  Mexican.  -'-vHe  inherits  the  playfulness  of  his  people.  He  is  whimsical.  He  is  even  raucous  at  times.   When  they"  accused  him  of  changing,  he  was  merely  fulfilling — a  little  late  perhaps —  the  earlier  promise.   That  wink  had  come  to  life  after  pulling  a  Rip  Van  Winkle.   Ramon's  natural,  youthful  zest  for  living  had  expended  itself  in  the  warm  somnolence  of  a  home  filled  with  a  large,  adoring  family;  had  spent  itself  in  religious  activities.   Instead  of  meeting  life,  diving  headlong  into  the  thrilling  mysteries  of  it  as  most  young  fellows  do,  taking  the  bad  with  the  good,  Ramon  sought  refuge  in  the  Church.   Religion  became  a  fulcrum  upon  which  he  leaned.   No  one  who  ever  had  the  privilege  of  seeing  Ramon  in  his  home  at  that  time  could  en-  tirely forget  the   impression  it  left.   Set  far  away  from  the  residences  of  other  film  notables,  it  expressed  the  varied  per-  sonalities of  Ramon's  interesting  family.   Among  the  many  unusual  things,  there  was  a  yard  surrounded  by  a  high  wall.  Throughout  the  yard  were  scattered  numerous  odd  and  assorted  gnome-like  statues.  They  were  more  Viennese  in  character  than  anything  else.  If  you  commented  on  them,  spoke  of  the  strangeness  of  finding  those  things  in  a  Los  Angeles  home,  Ramon  would  say,  "They  like  them."   To  reach  Ramon's  quarters,  one  had  to  traverse  the  sleeping  apartments  of  the  entire  family.  You  passed  along  a  corridor  of  about  six  bedchambers  before  arriving  at  his  wing  of  the  house.   Xo  tip- toeing  home  here  after  a  large  eve-  ning. The  whole  family  knew  when  Ramon  retired.   When  one  stepped  into  Ramon's  room,  one  breathed  an  air  of  pure  ecciesiasticism.  Gothic,  austere,  rich  and  quiet.  Time  for  meditation  here.   TF  you  were  lucky  enough  to  have  him  sing  -'-and  play  for  you  at  the  lovely  piano  resting  in  an  alcove,  you  felt  that  the  cup  of  tea  which  you  drank  afterwards  was  nectar  undiluted.   But  eventually  these  things  were  not  enough  for  Ramon.  What  satisfied  at  twenty  or  so  loses  its  relish  at  thirty.  He  was  aware  of  a  feeling  of  incompleteness.  His  naturally  robust  curiosity  began  to  need  other  contacts.  With  added  years,  came  a  longing,  a  desire,  for  broader  experiences.   It  was  a  chaotic  time  for  him.   All  moral  confusion  results  from  the  fact  that  few  people  know  their  own  nature,  and  then  only  a  small  majority  of  these  have  the  courage  to  act  in  accordance  with  it.   Ramon  had  that  courage  when  he  finally  found  himself.   He  proved  it  by  doing  two  courageous  things.   Ever  since  he  was  a  sapling  of  a  boy  he  had  thoughts  of  giving  his  life  to  the  Church.  He  reversed  that  decision  now,  without  in  any  sense  lessening  his  religious  principles,  and  he  moved  into  a  house  of  his  own.    His  mother,  sisters  and  brothers  were  first  amply  provided  for.  There  will  be  years  of  plentitude  ahead  for  them.   Ramon  is  developing — groping  maybe —  but  developing.   His  new  house  is  strictly  modernistic.  It  contains  the  last  mechanical  word  in  lighting  arrangement;  the  last  mechanical  adjustment  of  glass  roofs  and  things  for  getting  all  the  sunshine  that  California  has  to  offer.   Two  loyal  servants  look  after  his  well-being.  A  cousin  acts  as  chauffeur.   And  in  this  setting,  one  naturally  thinks  of  a  wife,  perhaps.   Since  he  referred  to  it  on  the  'telephone  I'll  tell  you  about  that  former  conversation  which  we  had  about  marriage.   It  was  a  three-way  affair.  Doris  Kenyon  Sills,  Ramon  and  myself  sat  talking  one  afternoon  at  Doris  and  Milton's  lovely  Brentwood  Heights  home.   All  happily  married  women  become  match-  makers.    Doris  and  I  fell  into  that  category.   TS  was  a  tough  spot  for  a  bachelor.  Ramon  -'-put  up  a  game  fight.  In  retrospect,  I  have  a  distinct  feeling  that  he  licked  the  two  of  us  in  fair  verbal  combat.   "Stop  it,  you  two,"  he  protested.  "You  think  that  what's  good  for  one  is  good  for  all.  That  sounds  like  the  battle  cry  of  The  Three  Musketeers."   "Xo,"  I  answered,  "we  just  feel  that  some  girl  is  missing  a  marvelous  bet  in  you  as  a  husband,  and  they're  terribly  scarce  out  here."   "But  I'm  not  against  marriage.  I  want  to  get  married  sometime.  I  just  haven't  met  a  girl  in  Hollywood  that  has  the  same  senti-  ments about  it  that  I  have,"  he  replied.   "Xow  Ramon,  don't  tell  me  that  all  our  girls  out  here  are  hey-nonny-nonnies,"  laughed  Doris.  "Are  you  casting  reflections  on  our  younger  set?"   "The  reflection  is  on  me,  I  guess,  Doris."  he  replied.  "I'm  old-fashioned  in  an  age  of  jazz,  gin  and  jitters.  I'm  old-fashioned  enough  to  want  loyalty,  fidelity  and  a  marriage  that  will  last.  You  know  with  me  it  cannot  break  on  the  rocks.    It  must  be  for  all  time."   Xow  when  Ramon  talks  like  that,  in  that  fascinating  voice  with  the  rolled  r's,  you  just  can't  wisecrack.  Whatever  he  believes  in  he  believes  in  with  his  whole  soul.  That's  why  his  capacity  for  friendship  is  greater  than  almost  anyone  I  know.   Once  you  have  Ramon's  friendship,  you  can  count  it  one  of  your  blessings  all  through  life.   Suddenly  I  asked  him,  "Are  you  afraid  of  marriage,  Ramon?"   He  hesitated  for  a  moment.   "Xo,"  he  answered  slowly.  "It  is  my  greatest  illusion.  I  find  I  live  by  my  imagina-  tion, my  admirations  and  my  sentiments.  I  do  not  like  to  have  my  illusions  disturbed.  That  is  another  reason  why  I  have  hesitated  about  marriage.  I  would  wish  it  to  result  in  the  highest  development,  mental  and  spiritual,  but  both  parties  must  desire  it  and  cooperate."   Doris  threw  up  her  hands.   "Vou  are  making  chaos  out  of  my  entire  philosophy,  knocking  down  my  beliefs  like  a  row  of  ten  pins,"  she  exclaimed.  "I  have  al-  ways thought  that  only  a  woman  reached  her  highest  spiritual  development  through  love.  That  a  man  ofttimes  arrived  at  the  same  place  through  his  creative  thought — his  work.''   "The  weather's  too  hot  for  such  heavy  think-  ing," I  said.  "Let's  got  a  cool  drink,  Doris,  before  Ramon  walks  out  on  us."   That  happened  a  couple  of  years  ago.   I  HAVE  a  feeling  that  when  Ramon  does  marry  it  will  be  an  older  woman.  He  has  sentiment  and  romance  that  the  average  flapper  never  heard  of.  She  wouldn't  know  what  in  thunder  to  do  with  him.   Personally,  I  believe  Ramon  has  unexplored  depths,  possibilities  yet  untouched.  He  no  longer  stands  at  the  cross-roads.  He  has  taken  the  turn  to  the  right.  Whether  that  road  leads  to  directing,  acting,  or  what,  it  does  not  matter.    There  is  genius  in  Ramon.  I  say  this  be-  cause there  is  a  certain  humility  about  every-  thing he  does  which  reminds  me  of  something  Emerson  wrote.   "If  we  weave  a  yard  of  tape  in  all  humility  and  as  well  as  we  can,  long  after  we  shall  see  it  was  no  cotton  tape  at  all,  but  some  galaxy  which  we  braided,  and  that  the  threads  were  time  and  nature."   Time  and  nature  have  brought  to  maturity  in  Ramon  what  was  once  a  tantalizing  wink  in  the  eye  of  a  youth.  It  might  easily  have  been  only  the  bud  of  a  wild  oat.  Happily  it  turned  out  to  serve  as  a  piece  of  stout  string  upon  which  he  will,  with  his  innumerable  beads  of  life,  some  day  make  a  necklace  of  rare  and  lasting  beauty.    What  Is  This  Thing  Called  "X"?    [COXTIXUED  FROM  PAGE  28  ]   thinking,  Kay  Francis,  Claudette  Colbert,  Sylvia  Sidney  and  Miriam  Hopkins  are  on  the  shadowy  borderlines  of  X-ness.  Each  has  a  compelling  magnetic  quality.  And  yet  each  exhibits  a  totally  different  charm.   Also,  we  think  that  Clara  Bow — the  IT  girl  personified — has  more  than  a  gambler's  chance  of  becoming  a  glorious  X-woman.   Vet  X  is  in  no  way  connected  with  the  suc-  cess or  popularity  of  a  star  or  personality.   Helen  Hayes,  one  of  the  greatest  actresses  on  the  screen  today — according  to  some,  the  greatest- — is  devoid  of  X.  And  so  is  Ann  Harding.   DIANA  WYNYARD,  another  great  actress  (did  you  see  her  performance  in  "Caval-  cade"?), has  great  charm,  beauty,  talent.  But  as  yet  she  has  not  approximated  X.  And  this  provocative  allure  is  also  missing  from  Elissa  Landi  and  from  the  latest  English  importa-  tion, Lilian  Harvey.   Janet  Gaynor  has  about  as  much  X  as  a  new-  born babe.  And  yet  think  of  the  enormous  appeal  she  has.   Ditto  Marian  Nixon.   Lupe  Velez  has  IT  galore — and  pepper  and  ginger  and  tabasco  and  paprika — but  no  X.   Jean  Harlow  and  Mae  West  have  oodles  of  IT — so  much,  it  almost  smothers  one — but  X  is  an  unknown  quantity  in  their  make-up.   Barbara  Stanwyck  has  IT  and  a  vitality  that's  positively  staggering — but  no  X.   Ruth  Chatterton  has  a  more  sophisticated  and  civilized  brand  of  IT,  which  may  some  day  develop  into  X.   Mary  Pickford  stands  alone — but  without  X.   Norma  Shearer,  mistress  of  the  many  moods  — from  tender  lyric  to  profoundly  dramatic —  still  lacks  X.   And  in  this  everything-it-takes-but-X  cate-  gory belong  Irene  Dunne,  Constance  and  Joan  Bennett.    Charm  plus — but  no  X.   Which  goes  without  saying  for  Marion  Davies,  Carole  Lombard,  Constance  Cum-  mings,  Nancy  Carroll  and  Bette  Davis.   As  far  as  we  can  tell,  the  X  quality,  like  "the  face  that  launched  a  thousand  ships,"  has  little  connection  with  the  once-accepted,  conven-  tional attributes  of  beauty.  The  X-women,  in  physical  type,  at  least  today,  have  nothing  of  the  luscious,  ripe  quality  of  the  IT  girls.  They  have  created  an  entirely  new  set  of  beauty  standards.  Instead  of  Mae  West's  ample  curves  ("she's  something  like  a  painting  by  Rubens)  or  Clara  Bow's  former  rounded  soft-  ness— the  X-women  of  the  American  movies  are  usually  angular.   Theirs  is  a  beauty  which  is  more  akin  to  the  old  Egyptian  art.   Broad  shoulders,  slender  torso,  long  limbs  almost  like  a  boy's.   Then  take  Garbo  again,  for  example.    She  is    Photoplay  Magazine  for  April,  1933  89   THE  MAGIC  OF  SPRING  is    in   this  new  make-up   Here  come  the  enchanting  new  shades  in  make-up  to  light  you  to  youth  and  springtime  beautv!

Her  hands  and  feet  are  large.  Her  face  has  a  bony  contour —  almost  gaunt  at  times.  High  cheek  bones;  large,  expressive  mouth;  long,  slender  neck  like  a  stalk  to  hold  the  exotic  flower-head.   Yet,  Garbo  has  only  to  make  one  slow  move-  ment, has  merely  to  look  out  of  the  screen  with  her  sad,  lustrous  eyes — and  her  audiences  bow  down  and  worship  what  seems  to  them  the  most  beautiful  creature  the  world  has  yet  known.   A/fARLENE  DIETRICH  and  Katharine  ■'•''■'•Hepburn  have  the  same  out-of-the-ordin-  ary  glory  about  them.  And  when  you  see  them  again — watch  their  movements.  Something  like  a  slow  motion  camera,  isn't  it?   You'll  notice  that  it  takes  them  twice  as  long  to  make  a  movement  as  it  does  the  or-  dinary actress.   There  is  about  them  something  of  that  strange  fascination  for  women  as  for  men.  Of  the  four,  however,  Garbo,  Crawford,  Hepburn,  Dietrich,  the  last  has  something  of  that  volup-  tuous flash  that  pulls  at  the  emotions  of  men.   And  X  doesn't  depend  on  youth.  The  stars  we  have  chosen  as  best  typifying  the  X-woman  are  mature.   In  manner  and  expression,  at  least,  if  not  in  years.   No  sweet  young  thing  of  sixteen  has  ever  had  X,  to  our  knowledge.  Bernhardt  had  X  up  to  her  death — an  old  woman  over  eighty.  The  middle-aged  Pavlowa,  the  dancer,  possessed  this  attribute.  The  potentialities  may  be  there — but  the  actual  expression  is  a  thing  of  slow  growth,  depending  on  understanding  and    Gentle  Lux  will  keep  your  hands  soft  and  young.  Gives  you  beauty  care  right  in  the  dishpan!   LUX  for  dishes   lovely  hands  for  If  a  day    experience  (of  the  imagination  at  any  rate)  rather  than  on  the  reckless  impetuosity  of  youth.   For  about  the  X-woman,  there  is  always  the  exciting  possibility  of  richer  discoveries.  She  never  reveals  everything.  Like  the  sphinx,  she  has  an  air  of  unfathomable  mystery — which  inevitably  arouses  the  desire  to  know  more  about  her.   She  holds  within  her  rich  reserves  of  joy,  of  suffering,  of  passion — which  seem  always  capable  of  renewal.  And  it  is  this  quality  which  attracts  to  her  the  great  and  magnificent  experiences  of  life,  as  surely  as  a  magnet  at-  tracts iron.   Some  skeptics  might  hold  that  an  X-woman  would  be  a  dismal  failure  as  a  wife.  Very  un-  comfortable to  have  mooning  around  the  house.   Because  ecstasy  and  stew  for  dinner  don't  seem  to  have  much  in  common.   And  being  of  "the  stuff  that  dreams  are  made,"  it  might  be  quite  a  strain  for  hubby  to  live  up  to  her  and  the  romantic  ideals  she  rep-  resents.   "  A  FELLA'S  got  to  relax  and  put  on  the  old  •**•  carpet  slippers  once  in  a  while,"  they'd  say.  "You  can't  always  be  striking  attitudes  on  the  heights.  Can  you  imagine  an  everyday  chap  idolizing  his  wife  the  way  Ramon  Novarro  idolized  Garbo  in  'Mata  Hari'?  Now,  I  ask  you?"   Well,  that's  a  point  for  discussion.  Maybe  the  X-less  woman  does  make  a  more  comfort-  ble  mate.   What  do  you  think?    The  Shadow  Stage    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  31    BE  MINE  TONIGHT—  Gaumont  British — Universal   "COR  pure  lyrical  beauty,  and  a  feast  for  the  *-  eyes,  this  beautiful  musical  production  has  no  superior,  while  Jan  Kiepura,  Polish  opera  star,  has  the  best  voice  heard  on  the  screen  since  Tibbett.  The  story,  based  on  the  mis-  taken identity  motif,  enjoys  the  lovely  back-  grounds of  the  Italian-Swiss  border.  If  you  are  one  who  has  yearned  for  some  really  good  music  with  your  picture,  don't  miss  this  one.   THE  WOMAN  ACCUSED— Paramount   '"PEN  great  authors  wrote  the  story — and  put  •*■  in  everything  but  a  plot.  Nancy  Carroll  kills  a  former  suitor,  and  Cary  Grant,  an  astute  young  lawyer  in  love  with  her,  figures  out  why  she  shouldn't  be  tried  for  it.  An  opulent  pro-  duction, John  Halliday  and  Jack  LaRue  help  make  the  picture  interesting  if  not  extraordi-  nary.   WHAT!    NOBEERf—M-G-M   PLENTY  of  foam  but  little  sparkle  to  this  -*-  one.  Jimmy  Durante  and  Buster  Keaton,  thinking  beer  is  now  legal,  buy  a  brewery  and  go  to  work,  only  to  have  gangsters  crash  in.  Phyllis  Barry  grand  as  the  gold-digger;  Rosco  Ates,  Henry  Armetta  and  John  Miljan  add  good  bits.   THE  BIG  DRIVE— First  Division   1  I  'HOSE  who  can  stand  seeing  men  slain  with  ■*-  bayonets,  heaps  of  dead  being  buried  and  the  like,  will  find  this  assemblage  of  official  films  the  most  revealing  glimpse  of  the  World  War  yet  offered.  Absolutely  trench-made —  even  the  poor  photography  proves  that.  Since  the  accompanying  talk  bristles  with  errors  of  fact,  let  the  pictures  tell  their  own  story.  Em-  phatically not  for  children.    AIR  HOSTESS— Columbia   A  LL  about  love,  a  misunderstood  wife  and  -**-an  erring  husband,  with  the  problems  worked  out  high  above  mother  earth,  where  Evalyn  Knapp,  the  troubled  wife,  carries  on  with  her  duty  of  making  timid  airplane  pas-  sengers comfortable.  Has  James  Murray,  Ar-  thur Pierson,  Thelma  Todd,  and  some  enter-  tainment value.   SOUS  LA  LUNE  DU  MAROC  (MOON   OVER  MOROCCO)— Vandal-Delac   Prod.   T_TOW  three  gay  young  European  blades  see  ■^  -'-Morocco  and  die,  and  two  others  live  on.  All  because  of  a  weird  curse  pronounced  by  a  vengeful  Algerian  beggar.  The  main  mystery  plot,  feebly-directed  love  interest,  and  lagging  tempo,  fall  far  short  of  American  standards;  but  authentic  pictures  of  strange  Eastern  cere-  monials and  exciting  photography  cast  the  proper  Oriental  atmospheric  spell.  Would  make  an  excellent  travelogue.   DER  HAUPTMANN  VON  KOEPENICK   {THE  CAPTAIN  OF  KOEPENICK)—   Carl  Zuckmayer  Prod.   ■"THIS  German  film  can  neither  be  classified  -^  as  comedy  nor  drama,  but  rather  as  an  effective  blending  of  the  two.  A  humble  old  cobbler,  thrice  imprisoned  for  petty  transgres-  sions, decides  clothes  make  the  man,  dons  a  captain's  uniform  and  proceeds  to  rule  the  town  for  but  a  brief  moment.

SISTER  TO  JUDAS— Mayfair  Pictures   CLAIRE  WINDSOR,  as  an  orchid  in  a  bed  of  cabbage,  tries  nobly  to  rise  above  her  environment  by  becoming  a  publishing  house  reader  and  saying  "lit'ry.

BEHIND  JURY  DOORS  Mayfair  Pictures   AGAIN  a  wise-cracking  newspaper  reporter  falls  in  love  with  the  murderer's  daughter  and  clears  her  father.  This  time  it's  fairly  en-  tertaining, thanks  to  Buster  Collier,  Franklin  Parker  and  others.   IHRE  MAJESTAET  DIE  HEBE   (HER   MAJESTY,  LOVE)—   Warners-First  National   FRANCIS  LEDERER,  star  of  the  stage  play  "Autumn  Crocus,"  does  a  very  nice  job  of  winning  Kaethe  von  Nagy  (a  nightclub  hos-  tess) after  much  ado  within  his  very  proper  family  circle.  The  music  is  just  fair;  direction  and  photography  not  particularly  good.  But  brush  up  your  German  if  you  want  to  enjoy  the  humor.    No  English  subtitles.   DARING  DAUGHTERS— Tower  Prod.   WELL,  well !  We  haven't  seen  this  mummy  for  years!  Remember — older  sister  (Mar-  ian Marsh)  saving  the  younger  (Joan  Marsh)  from  the  big  bad  mans  by  showing  her  what  heels  they  are?  Also  a  fabricated  sick  grand-  mother, gold-digging  for  a  worthy  cause,  etc.,  etc.     Bert  Roach  is  funny,  though.   SOMEWHERE  IN  SONORA— Warners   TT'S  hard  to  find  features  in  this  Western.  -'■John  Wayne  faces  death  to  save  a  friend;  Henry  Walthall  is  good  in  a  bit;  Duke,  the  horse,  draws  applause;  but  what  you'll  like  best  is  some  really  lovely  scenery.   WEST  OF  SINGAPORE— Monogram   AN  incredibly  dull  story  of  the  oil  business  that  misses  on  every  count.  Weldon  Hey-  burn,  a  big  oil  man  of  Singapore  with  a  past  (Betty  Compson')  in  all  sorts  of  troubles  when  he  tries  to  increase  oil  production;  the  only  moment  of  suspense  is  when  the  boilers  threaten  to  explode.  Margaret  Lindsay's  performance  offers  some  relief.   JUNGLE  BRIDE— Monogram   fHARLES  STARRETT,  Anita  Page  and  ^-'others  shipwrecked  on  a  jungle  isle.  A  fight  with  a  genuine  antique  lion  comes  with  the  phony  jungle  for  good  measure;  after  the  recent  good  animal  stuff,  this  is  hard  to  take.

Photoplay  Magazine  for  April,  1933    93    Let's  Give  'Dolphe  a  Hand   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  67  ]    contributed  many  a  grand  and  glowing  por-  trait to  the  world's  gallery  of  interesting  film  before  he  lays  away  his  tail-coats  for  the  dress-  ing gown  and  slippers  of  senility.   For  all  that,  there  is  always  a  note  of  pathos  in  the  splendid  labors  of  M.  Menjou  for  the  current  screen.  There  is  always  a  faint  aura  of  neglect  that  lingers  'round  his  stunning  por-  traits, with  the  cheers  and  fireworks  going  up  for  the  stars  with  their  names  in  bigger  letters  and  brighter  lights.   Being  a  forward-looking  and  constructive  fellow,  I  have  a  suggestion  to  make.  Let  the  gentlemen  of  the  Academy  of  Motion  Picture  Arts  and  Sciences,  when  next  they  make  their  awards  for  brilliant  acting  performances,  forget  for  a  moment  the  labors  of  the  big-named  stars  and  consider  briefly  those  performances,  commonly  called  "secondary,"  which  can  and  do  make  some  pictures  glow  and  sparkle  and  sizzle  with  pulsing,  rich  humanity.   TN  such  a  consideration,  the  name  and  labors  -*-of  Monsieur  Adolphe  Menjou  would  appear,  bright  and  shining.   Notably  his  Riiuildi,  a  thing  of  true  charm  and  beauty.   And  others  he  will  accomplish  in  days  to  come,  if  the  big  bosses  give  him  the  break  he  deserves.   I  want  'Dolphe,  the  boy  who  broke  the  bonds  of  the  iron  shirt  and  grew  great,  to  be  counted  when  the  little  pewter  statuettes  of  the  nude  gentleman  are  issued  by  the  quartermaster.  I  don't  want  that  Menjou  fellow  to  be  the  most  unappreciated  actor  in  Hollywood.    No  More  Chinese,  Myrna?   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  53  1    not  slant  and  are  no  narrower  than  Swanson's.  But,  and  here's  the  secret,  the  lids  are  full.  The  eye  does  not  seem  to  rest  back  into  the  socket  as  other  people's  do.  So,  with  a  mere  dash  of  a  pencil  near  the  corners  and  a  wig,  she  looks  more  like  Sin  Toy  than  Sin  Toy  herself.   BUT  here's  the  strange  and  weird  part  of  it.  The  thing  has  retarded  her  career.  Exactly  as  though  some  strange,  mystic  force  were  hold-  ing her  back.   It  has  even  thrust  itself  into  her  personal  life.  At  a  theater,  the  other  evening,  Myrna  and  a  friend  were  suddenly  conscious  of  an  earnest  conversation  behind  them.  Imagine  her  surprise  when  a  voice  piped  in,  "Yes,  Myrna  Loy  is  Chinese.  You  see,  our  Chinese  laundry  man  lives  next  to  her  people" —   Shock  No.  2 — A  member  of  the  RKO-Radio  publicity  staff  came  dashing  inlo  her  dressing-  room  the  other  day.  "Look,"  he  said,  "I  just  won  ten  bucks.  At  noon  today  a  fellow  bet  me  ten  dollars  that  it  wasn't  you  in  the  commis-  sary. Swore  you  were  a  half-caste  Chinese  woman.  When  I  proved  it  was  you,  he  nearly  passed  out  with  surprise.    But  he  paid  up."   So  you  see!   Yet  Myrna  Loy  is  about  as  alluringly  exotic  off  the  screen  as  Aunt  Het  with  the  lumbago.  You'd  expect  her  perfumes  to  be  heavy  and  passionately  Siamish.  Actually  she  wears  a  light,  woodsy  scent  for  daytime  and  a  nice,  spicy  one  for  evening.   She  lives  with  her  mother,  her  aunt  and  her  brother,  in  a  nice  but  unpretentious  home  in    THERE'S    NO    EXCUSE    With  Pompeian  face  powder  you  can  be  sure  oj  your  loveliness  jor  hours.    How  ugly  even  the  prettiest  nose  may   look  half  an    hour  after   it  has  been   powdered  with  ordinary  powder/    "^im  nme!    It's  happened  to  all  of  us!  ...  A  furtive  glance  in  a  mirror  and  the  horrible  discovery  that  a  shiny-  nose  has  ruined  the  assurance  of  a  perfect  make-up.   But  from  this  day  forth,  you  have  no  excuse  if  you're  caught  at  anything  but  your  best.  For  Pompeian  has  perfected  a  soft  fine  powder  that  will  cling,  not  for  minutes,  but  for  hours!  In  ad-  dition to  this,  the  new  Pompeian  has  all  the  beauty-giving  proper-  ties of  the  finest  present-day  face    powders.  It  will  not  "coat"  the  skin.  Rather  it  gives  the  face  an  even,  delicate  perfection.  A  per-  fection you  can  be  confident  of  retaining  for  hours  after  you've  left  the  dressing-table!   It  comes  in  a  variety  of  flatter-  ing skin  tones,  expressly  created  to  complement  and  enhance  every  complexion  type.   It  has  an  unobtrusive  and  pleasantly  feminine  perfume.  The  clever  box  is  neat  ...  as  well  as  terribly  smart.   YOU'LL       LIKE      THE       PRICE!   All  that  our  long  experience  has  taught  us  to  save  in  manufacturing  costs  and  present  econ-  omies, we  pass  on  to  you.

And  works  harder  and  plays  less  than  any  ten  working  girls  put  together.   Publicity  departments  wash  their  hands  of  Myrna  completely.  What  can  you  say  of  a  girl  who  lives  normally  and  doesn't  think  being  a  movie  actress  calls  for  hoc-cha-cha  and  a  bun  on  at  the  Mayfair?  Myrna  is  bad  copy,  knows  it,  and  doesn't  know  what  to  do  about  it.   CHE  has  never  been  to  New  York.  San  ^ Francisco  is  the  farthest  she's  traveled  from  Hollywood  since  leaving  Montana.  She  is  con-  stantly surrounded  by  travel  catalogues  and  steamship  literature.  But  every  time  she  plans  to  go  somewhere,  Hollywood  needs  her.  In  fact,  she  had  her  trunks  packed  for  Hawaii  when  they  called  her  back  for  retakes  on  "Emma."    So  she  sent  her  kid  brother.   And  it  was  that  small  role  of  a  normal  but  unsympathetic  American  girl  in  "  Emma,"  which  first  gave  her  hope.  Then  along  came  "Thirteen  Women"  with  Myrna  as  nasty  a  Javanese  female  as  ever  lived.  She  played  it  beautifully.  But  it  put  her  right  back  where  she  started  from.   Then,  three  cheers  for  our  side,  she  got  that  grand  little  bit  in  Chevalier's  "Love  Me  To-  night." A  humorous  little  tidbit,  and  Myrna  made  it  sit  up  on  its  hind  feet  and  bark.  Letters  from  movie-goers  poured  in.  Now,  she  thought,  they  know  I'm  an  actress  and  not  a  frozen-faced  Oriental  slinking  around  doing  dirt.   But  you  know  what  happened.  "The  Mask  of  Fu  Manchu."   Still,  if  Hollywood  can  smack  you  down  harder  than  you've  ever  been  smacked  before,  it  can  also  suddenly  lift  you  to  heights  never  dreamed  of.     See  what  it  did  to  Myrna.     It    THE  ORIGINAL  TOMATO  JUICE  C  O  C  KTA  I  L   College   Inn  Food   Products  Co.   Hotel  Sherman,   Chicago     .    415  Greenwich  St.,  New  York    took  her  right  out  of  the  depths  of  the  "Fu  Manchu"  business  and  waltzed  her  into  the  refined  and  cultured  midst  of  Leslie  Howard,  Ann  Harding  and  "The  Animal  Kingdom."  Presto,  chango,  just  like  that.   If  you  saw  "The  Animal  Kingdom,"  you  know  what  Myrna  did  with  that  role  of  Cecilia,  the  "society"  wife  with  a  heart  like  a  block  of  ice  and  a  figure  like  Patou's  bewitchingest  model.   With  all  due  apologies  to  Ann  Harding  fol-  lowers, Myrna  marched  that  lovely,  scheming  hypocrite  straight  up  to  first  place  for  female  honors.   Oh,  she  was  a  siren  all  right,  all  right.  But  this  time  a  siren  whom,  alas,  one  meets  in  every  third  "social  register"  home.  The  respectable  wife  who  uses  her  sorcery  as  coldly  as  any  money-mad  mistress.   In  brief,  Myrna  played  that  nasty,  unsym-  pathetic part — and  practically  stole  the  show!   She  kept  her  fingers  crossed  and  held  her  breath  when  the  picture  was  over.   Another  Chinaman  next,  as  sure  as  you  live,  she  thought.   "DUT  no.  Instead,  they  handed  her  a  smock.  -'-'And  not  only  a  smock,  but  John  Barrymore  as  well.  So  Myrna  and  John  Barrymore  are  cavorting  about  in  "Topaze,"  the  realest,  grandest  part  she's  had  yet.  Not  an  exotic,  heartless  Siamese  something  or  other;  not  even  a  cruel,  modern,  unsympathetic  woman,  but  a  part  that  is  exactly  like  Myrna  herself.  Enjoy-  ing life,  knowing  it's  not  all  the  berries,  but  making  the  best  of  it.  Such  is  Myrna  in  "Topaze."   Now  we'll  see  what  happens.  We'll  all  just  sit  back  and  see.

[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  31  ]   their  lives,  Doug  and  Joan  undoubtedly  will  get  a  divorce — that  is,  unless  one  of  'em  dies  before  the  other.   They  wouldn't  need  it  then  and  that  would  be  a  shame,  because  the  rumor-mongers  would  have  to  find  something  else  to  wrap  their  tongues  around.   Not  that  they  miss  anything  now,  of  course.   But  Doug  and  Joan  really  should  go  to  court  about  something,  anyway.  They  shouldn't  disgrace  Hollywood  by  staying  married  like  that.  Such  a  pretty  romance  shouldn't  go  flourishing  on  and  on — and  it  won't,  if  Hollywood  can  help  it.   Hollywood  does  so  want  to  say:  "I  told  you  so!"   It  has  wanted  to  say  that  ever  since  Joan,  seeing  Doug  for  the  first  time  when  he  was  playing  in  "Young  Wooclley"  at  the  Belasco  Theater,  back  in  November  1927,  sent  him  a  congratulatory  wire  on  his  performance.  Doug  invited  her  out  to  dinner,  and  the  ro-  mance grew.   Hollywood  said  then  that  it  was  puppy  love — that  it  couldn't  last.   AFTER  Hollywood  had  married  them  in  Mexico,  and  they  actually  were  married  in  St.  Malachy's  Church  in  New  York,  Holly-  wood said  that  the  marriage  couldn't  possibly  last  six  months.   After  the  six  months  had  elapsed,  Hollywood  said  it  certainly  couldn't  last  a  year.  And  after  the  year,  assuredly  not  another  year — or  another,  and  another.   From  1929  to  1933  is  four  years — but  it's  all  off  now.     Hollywood  says  so.   Maybe  it  is  all  off.  Maybe  Joan  and  Doug  have  at  last  come  to  the  parting  of  the  ways.  Maybe  they'll  only  part  their  hair,  instead.  Maybe — well  maybe  they'll  stay  married  thirteen  more  years — and  maybe  not!   That's  Hollywood!

I  was  so  emancipated  with  rage.   T  SLIPPED  on  the  rug  in  the  lobby,  and  that  ■•■give  me  an  idea.  Did  it  give  me  an  idea,  or  did  it  give  me  an  idea?  Like  a  flash,  it  penetrated  my  cerebum.  Doug  Fairbanks  took  trips  and  made  'em  pay,  why  not  me?  Why  not  make  this  trip  a  travelogue?  Now,  was  that  an  idea?   If  Doug  went  around  the  world  in  eighty  minutes  on  a  piece  of  carpet,  I  could  do  it  to  New  York  in  ten  minutes,  on  a  bath  towel,  and  sell  it  to  Warners  for  a  short.  'Magine  me  flyin'  over  Broadway  on  a  bath  towel.  And  holding  an  umbrella  over  my  head,  to  give  it  class,  see.  The  whole  ting  was  a  cincb.  I  had  it  all  figured  out.   But,  after  thinkin'  it  over,  I  give  it  up.  There  was  no  use  get  tin'  the  enmity  of  a  swell  guy  like  Doug  Fairbanks,  and,  considerin'  all  the  jealousy  it  would  cause,  I  absconded  the  idea.   Back  in  Hollywood,  the  last  ting  I  done,  was  to  visit  my  dressin'  room.  I  stood  outside  the  door  beside  the  big  basket  of  flowers  I  had  sent  to  myself.   Final,  I  was  ready  to  go,  see.  I  had  on  my  shoit  and  collar,  and  did  I  look  the  well  dressed  man  in  travelin'  apparent!  Hot  cha  cha — cha  cha — cha  cha.   "Well,"  I  said  to  Clark  Gable,  "I'm  off.  I'm  enroute."   "No,  Jimmy,"  he  says,  "with  that  nose,  you're  'en-root.'  "   The  absolute  assidity  of  it.  That's  what  hoits  the  most.    The  assidity  of  it.   The  next  mornin'  I'm  at  the  depot  early  and  I  grab  a  conspacious  place  on  the  rear  plat-  form and,  sure  enough,  just  off  to  my  left  is  a  guy  lookin'  through  one  of  them  camera  things,  and  I'm  all  set  for  the  newsreel.    I  was  goin'  over  all  the  poses  I'd  practiced  on  the  back  lot,  for  the  third  time,  when  the  guy  behind  the  newsreel,  strolls  over.  "What's  the  matter,  fella?"  he  says.  "Ain't  you  feelin'  well?"   I  was  chagrinned.  "Why,"  I  said,  "wasn't  I  posing  all  right?"   "Posin'?"  he  says.  "Why,  I  ain't  no  camera-  man.   I'm  surveyin'  for  a  new  railroad  track."   The  final  blow.  The  whole  futility  of  it  was  overcomin'  me.  I  was  a  man,  persecuted  by  the  abject  humidity  of  life.   Pracally  unnoticed  and  unsung,  you  might  say,  me,  an  artist  of  my  temperament,  made  that  trip  across  the  country.  And  then,  we  hit  New  York.   Here,  I  thinks  to  myself,  is  old  Broadway.  I  could  do  witout  Broadway  but  could  Broad-  way do  witout  me?  And  was  I  right?  Was  I  right?    The  place  was  a  riot.   A  panic.  Reporters  flocked  around,  bands  played,  flashlights  boomed.  I  was  a  con-  founded panic.  Boy,  I  gave  them  the  ulterior  motive  pose  and  the  full  poisonality,  till  they  was  hyterical.   "T\7HAT    you    doin',   Jimmy?"    a    friend   **  caught  my  arm  and  said.  "Why,  look  at  this  precipitation,"  I  said.  "The  reporters  and  cameramen  out  to  greet  me."   "Gosh,  Jimmy,"  he  says.  "They  ain't  out  to  greet  you.  They're  after  Al  Smith.  See,  he  just  got  off  the  train."  And  there  was  Al  in  his  doiby  and  cigar,  and  just  then,  he  toins  around,  see,  and  says  to  me,  "Boy,  carry  this  bag."   The  final  blow.  The  bitter  futility  of  the  whole  thing.   And  then  I  thought,  "Why,  Al's  one  of  the  boys  from  the  old  East  Side.  One  of  the  gang  from  the  old  Fourt'  ward."  So  I  ups  to  him  with  a  heart  overflowing  with  sympathetic  gravity  and  down  old  Broadway  we  march,  see,  me  carrying  Al's  bag.   Two  boys  from  the  old  Fourt'  ward.   And,  could  Broadway  do  without  us?   Just  the  humidity  of  the  thought  is  aggra-  vatin'.    !*■   Ij  wU  Mi   •   w     ^''.NSfci   jf   tim     '   At  last — television!

In  the  midst  of  an  avalanche  of  feminine-  adulation  Garat  trotted  out  and  brought  back  his  scotty  dog,  "Blackie."   He  wanted  Blackie  to  share  some  of  the  attention.    And  Blackie  did.   We  were  joking  about  the  tempiations  in  Hollywood — the  temptations  held  out  to  an  attractive  male  star  by  the  loveliest  women  in  the  world.   Henry  shrugged  and  smiled.   "All  women  are  beautiful  to  me,"  he  said,  "every  woman  is  different  —  each  one  an  interesting  study.  I  do  not  theenk  I  will  lose  my  head  in  Hollywood,  although  I  admit  I  am  just  a  leetle  bit  afraid  of  the  place — I've  heard  so  much  about  its  beauty — its  glamour — its  romantic  attachments — I  shall  try  always  to  be  just  as  I  am — ".   He  smiled  at  his  wife  and  she  smiled  back.  They  are  apparently  very  much  in  love  with  each  other — married  only  since  last  April,  just  about  a  year.   "You  see,"  Madame  Garat  want  on,  "I  am  going  to  try  to  be  an  understanding  wife.  So  many  wives  do  not  realize  the  sacrifices  to  a  husband's  picture  career — the  time  and  attention  he  must  give  to  matters  outside  his  home.   "But  I  had  been  backstage  for  several  years  before  Henry  and  I  married.  I  was  a  dancer,  with  my  sister  Paula.  We  did  a  sister  act  and  toured  Europe.  And  I  think  I  understand  that  Henry's  time  in  Hollywood  will  not  be  entirely  mine."   Some  one  spoke  of  Chevalier  and  his  sudden  divorce  after  fame  had  come  to  him.  Betty  Garat  looked  up  quickly  at  her  husband  and  a  spark  which  only  they  alone  understood  flashed   between   them.   "Yes,  that  was  a  great  pity,"  she  said.  "We  knew  Chevalier  in  Paris  and  we  are  friends  of  his  wife,  Yvonne.  She  admits  she  was  terribly  jealous  of  Maurice  in  Hollywood.  She  could  never  quite  reconcile  her  Continental  ideas  to  the  new  code  which  confronted  them  out  there.  Yvonne  seems  lonely  now  without  him.   "Just  before  we  left  Paris  I  met  her  one  day  in  a  hat  shop  trying  on  all  of  the  new  models  and  she  told  me  then  she  was  simply  lost  for  an  interest  in  life."

Janet  claims  that  too  many  people  close  their  hearts  to  the  call  of  sentiment  and  thereby  lose  much  of  the  sweetness  of  life.  To  be  receptive  to  love  is  the  blossom  from  which  romance   develops.   Janet  also  thinks  everyone  should  go  to  the  movies  more  often.  She  claims  people  can  live  the  romances  of  the  screen  in  their  own  minds  if  they  open  up  to  the  beauty  screened  before  them.    That  is  why,  no  doubt,  she,  too,  is  just  as  anxious  to  start  working  with  Henry  Garat  as  he  is  anxious  to  begin  work  with  her.   They  are  both  sympathetic  people — sensi-  tive to  life.  And  that  ought  to  make  the  new  romantic  team  of  Gaynor-Garat  one  of  the  most  popular  on  every  movie  program  in  America.

Is  the  Garbo  Rage  Over:    v    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  37  |    a  Don  Juan  public  and  held  it  for  seven  years,  John  Gilbert  was  her  leading  man.  The  story  of  the  romance  which  developed  between  them  as  a  result  of  that  screen  teaming  has  been  retold  too  often  to  make  it  necessary  to  men-  tion again.   LOVE,"  "A  Woman  of  Affairs,"  brought  these  two  surpassing  screen  lovers  together  again  and  sent  audiences  and  critics  away  from  the  theaters  positively  raving.   Here  at  last,  they  said,  was  the  romance  team  of  all  time.   But — and  here  is  a  curious  point — the  Garbo  of  those  early  pictures  with  John  Gilbert  was  an  entirely  different  woman  from  the  Garbo  of  "Romance"  (with  Gavin  Gordon),  "Susan  Lenox"  (with  Clark  Gable),  "Mata  Hari"  (with  Ramon  Novarro),  and  "Grand  Hotel''  (with  John  Earrymore).   The  early  Garbo  was  as  different  from  the  cool,  remote  goddess-like  celebrity  of  these  more  recent  achievements  as  is  a  moss  rose  from  an  orchid.   Despite  the  standard  pattern  of  the  roles  which  she  portrayed — for  has  Garbo  not  always  been  the  woman  who  loved  not  wisely  but  too  well? — she  was  in  those  first  years  of  her  heyday  a  warm,  wholly-tender,  wholly-  human  being.  A  woman  who  desired  as  pas-  sionately as  she  was  desired.  In  her  acting  there  was  none  of  that  aloof  unaccountable  quality  which  has  awed  and  defeated  so  many  of  her  leading  men.  This,  by  the  way,  was  pointed  out  in  a  Photoplay  article  last  Sep-  tember.   We  may  be  reading  too  much  into  this  strange  change  which  came  over  Garbo  in  her  later  pictures.  But  there  did  seem  to  be  a  definite  transformation  from  a  warm  creature  of  flesh  and  blood  and  too,  too  many  impulsive  mistakes,  to  the  dominating,  unattainable  woman  she  becomes  in  such  characterizations  as  the  prima  donna  in  "  Romance";  the  famous,  mysterious  courtesan-spy  in  "Mata  Hari";  the  toast  of  Paris  in  "Inspiration."   WHETHER  this  change  of  attitude  in  Garbo's  acting  and  feeling  was  deliberate  on  her  part;  whether  it  was  simply  her  artiit-  way  of  interpreting  the  film  story;  whether  it  was  the  result  of  a  subconscious  inner  change  over  which  she  had  no  control;  whether  it  was  the  wish  of  her  directors — we  are  not  privileged  to  say  or  to  know.   The  fact  still  holds  that  the  human  Greta  who  responded  so  warmly  to  the  kisses  of  her  screen  lover,  John  Gilbert — the  young,  won-  dering, almost  innocent  Greta  (in  using  these  descriptive  terms,  we  are  still  fully  aware  of  the  type  of  role  she  portrayed)  retired  from  the  screen  for  six  years.  To  return  to  it  again  in  the  taller  half  of  "As  Yon  Desire  Me."   And  I  believe  both  pro  and  anti-Garboites  will  truthfully  admit  this— in  spite  of  the  r.'ile  she  interprets,  the  "mystery  woman"  of  the  screen  has  always  been  as  yon  desired  Iter.  No  matter  whether  she  played  the  part  of  a  tired,  death-wishing  celebrity  in  "Grand  Hotel,"  or  whether  she  was  one  of  those  unhappy  crea-  tures,   Anna    Christie,    Iris    March    or   Anna    Karenina  of  her  earlier  acting  phases — we,  the  public,  would  never  have  wanted  her  to  be  any  different  from  what  she  has  been.  We  could  never  have  asked  her  to  give  us  any  more  than  she  did,  for  she  has  enabled  us  to  glimpse  the  heights.   Those  critics,  whose  gadfly  insinuations  are  now  attempting  to  tear  down  the  pedestal  which  they,  themselves,  have  built,  should  just  remember  one  thing:  It  was  they,  along  with  the  rest  of  the  public,  who  actually  fostered  and  encouraged  the  "mystery"  legend  which  has  centered  about  Garbo  for  the  past  seven  years — which  had  made  of  her  an  inhuman  goddess.   When  Garbo  became  Rita  Cavallini  of  "  Romance,"  or  that  uncanny  character,  Mata  Hari,  she  was  portraying  a  feminine  type  which  had  captured  the  world's  fancy  at  that  time.   TSwTEWSPAPERS,  magazines,  hundreds  of  -L^  books,  were  making  heroines  of  these  super  women  who  thought  themselves  strong  enough  to  defy  the  laws  of  conventional  society.  Who  believed  they  could  succeed  in  stepping  be-  yond the  bounds  of  accepted  good  and  evil.   It  was  the  boom  period.  Success — shady  or  otherwise — was  the  magic  shibboleth  of  that  day.  We  were  sophisticated,  slightly  cynical,  and  very  sure  of  ourselves.  We  wanted  the  sensational  in  our  lives,  in  our  reading,  in  our  motion  picture  fare.  And  we  wanted  the  queen  of  all  screen  stars  to  depict  such  roles  for  us.   But  times  have  changed.  There  is  a  decided  tendency  to  scrap  these  pseudo-sophisticated  ideas.  There  is  a  longing  in  many  of  us  to  return  to  the  simpler,  sweeter  ways  of  living  and  of  thinking.   And  if  some  critics  have  mentioned  the  possibility  that  Garbo's  star  may  be  on  the  wane,  and  have  used  as  their  proof  the  fact  that  the  public  are  now  perhaps  a  little  weary  of  the  type  of  slightly  tainted  lady  characters  for  which  she  has  become  so  famous — let  them  recall  the  last  half  of  "As  You  Desire  Me."   This  picture  marks  the  return  of  the  old  Garbo.  Simply  and  with  deep  sincerity  she  plays  the  part  of  the  wife  who  came  back.  From  a  tired,  hopeless  cabaret  artist  and  courtesan,  she  transforms  herself  radiantly  to  fit  the  fragile  memory  of  that  young  bride  who  was  lost  to  her  soldier  husband  years  before.  And,  in  meeting  the  requirements  of  Melvyn  Douglas'  dream  picture,  in  becoming  as  he  desires  her,  the  divine  Garbo  is  once  again  as  we  desire  iter.   SHE  has  stepped  down  from  the  cold,  moon-  struck peaks,  to  be  with  us  again  as  she  was  in  the  days  of  her  early  pictures.   Yet,  in  so  doing,  she  has  lost  none  of  her  mystery  and  potent  allure.  That,  she  will  always  have.   Whether  or  not  Garbo's  next  few  pictures  will  revert  to  the  pattern  of  the  super-woman,  is  immaterial.   For  Garbo  the  Magnificent,  Garbo  the  Com-  plete Artist,  has  proven  herself  eternally  ca-  pable of  eternal  change.   Who  said  anything  about  the  Garbo  rage  being  over?

After  the  race  the  fellow  returned,  glowering.   "Listen,"  he  said,  "I  put  all  my  money  on  that  horse  because  you  said  it  looked  good,  and  I  lost."   "Well,"  Charlie  said  in  surprise,  "it  still  looks  good  to  me,  but  then,  I  like  horses."   Charlie's  story  of  Lubitsch  during  the  mak-  ing of  "Trouble  In  Paradise"  is  a  scream.  It  seems  Ernst  was  fully  expecting  and  gleefully  anticipating  a  temperamental  row  between  Ruggles  and  Eddie  Horton,  the  two  comedians  of  the  picture.  He  could  scarcely  wait  to  get  them  together.  But  to  Ernst's  utter  amaze-  ment, nothing  happened.  He  couldn't  understand  it.   So  Ernst  set  about  to  see  what  could  be  done  about  it.  "Listen,"  he'd  say  to  Charlie  before  Eddie,  "now  this  is  Horton's  scene,  so  don't  try  to  steal  it."  Then  with  his  own  hands  he'd  place  Charlie  a  little  nearer  the  camera  than  Horton.  After  the  scene  he'd  beckon  for  Horton.  "Aha,  you  see  that  Rug-  gles step  up  and  steal  your  scene?  You  see  it,  eh?  Well,  you  going  to  let  him  get  away  with  it?"  he'd  egg  him  on.   OR  next  time  he'd  move  Eddie  up  in  Ruggles'  scene  and  whisper  to  Charlie,  "See,  what  did  I  tell  you.  That  guy  Horton  is  stealing  your  scenes.    Better  start  something."   At  the  conclusion  of  the  picture,  with  Eddie  and  Charlie  still  friends,  Lubitsch  sent  them  an    invitation    to    the   preview.      He    wrote:   "Dear  Eddie,  come  see  Ruggles  steal  the  whole  picture  away  from  you.  What  did  I  tell  you  about  that  fellow?"   And:  "Dear  Charlie,  come  see  how  Horton  steal  all  your  scenes.  See,  I  warn  you  about  that  thief  stealer  of  pictures,  eh?"   But  Charlie,  the  quiet  fox,  had  his  own  way,  as  we've  seen,  of  taking  care  of  himself.  So  there's  a  good  sample  of  why  Charlie  likes  the  movies.

They  were  divorced  two  years  later,  and  then  Mae  followed  in  her  chum's  footsteps  the  tortuous  road  to  Heartbreak  Town.   Mae  found  the  path  pretty  tough.  Trying  to  get  somewhere,  and  finding  yourself  up  against  a  stone  wall.  Mae  battered  against  the  wall,  though,  and  got  herself  a  test.  From  that  she  got  a  small  role  in  a  picture  called  "Big  Time."   It  wasn't,  though — not  very.   Then  Mae  freelanced,  as  it  is  called  profes-  sionally; actually,  she  got  herself  a  job  wher-  ever she  could  find  one.   "I  guess  it's  a  good  thing  we  never  had  much,"  she  said  quietly,  "because  I  didn't  miss  it.  you  see.  There  were  times  when  I  actually  didn't  have  a  cent.  Sometimes  I  almost  wished  myself  back  selling  hot  dogs  at  Atlantic  City,  so  that  I  could  eat  a  few."   But  she  got  a  part  in  "Nix  on  Dames,"  and    Universal  signed  her  to  a  long-term  contract  on  the  strength  of  her  work.  There  she  made  eight  pictures,  culminating  with  "Waterloo  Bridge."    She  was  going  up  fast.   Then  came  the  blow.   Mae  had  met  and  fallen  in  love  with  a  man,  a  big  shot  in  picture  circles.  Mae  doesn't  care  to  talk  about  it  much,  but  the  big  diamond  he  gave  her  speaks  for  itself.   And  then,  out  of  a  clear  blue  sky,  he  sud-  denly married  somebody  else.   The  bottom  dropped  completely  out  of  Mae's  world.   It  was  shortly  after  that  when  she  suffered  her  breakdown.  Too  much  work,  the  doctors  said.    And  perhaps  it  was.   Anyway,  Mae  went  to  the  hospital  and  re-  mained there  four  long  months.  Her  contract  was  canceled.  Everything  which  she  had  striven  for,  everything  which  she  had  gained,  was  snatched  away.   When  she  left  the  hospital  she  had  to  begin  all  over  again.    But  that  wasn't  the  worst  of  it.   She  will  tell  you  now  that  she  is  disillusioned  — that  she  isn't  interested  in  men.  In  the  next  breath  she  will  tell  you  that  her  ambition  is  not  to  crash  the  clouds  so  much  as  to  lead  the  normal  life  of  a  woman,  with  a  home,  a  husband  and  a  child.   SHE'S  changed,  yes — superficially.  But  un-  derneath she's  the  sameMae  who,  when  things  were  going  wrong,  used  to  go  home  and  write  poetry  about  it.   "When  I  wanted  to  say  something,"  she  ex-  plained, ''and  didn't  know  just  what  it  was,  I'd  get  down  my  book — and  it  would  sort  of  write  itself."   No,  Mae  just  didn't  know  when  she  was  licked.   Since  she  has  started  again  Mae  has  ap-  peared in  a  number  of  pictures,  among  which  were  "Breach  of  Promise,"  "The  Penguin  Pool  Murder"  and  "As  the  Devil  Commands."  She  is verymuchin demand  and  received  a  contract  for  ber  work  in  "Rivets",  Jack  Gilbert's  cur-  rentfilm.  She  actually  did  not  have  time  to  take  her  make-up  off  between  her  last  two  roles.  It's  Hollywood  that's  licked,  now.  Mae  is  again  sitting  on  top  of  the  world.   But  it's  only  because  she  was  game.    Hollywood  Goes  British   I  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  34  1    distracted  directors  and  supervisors.  "Where  shall  we  find  the  pleasing,  resonant  voices  we  need?  Where  can  we  pick  up  those  necessary,  cultured  accents?  "   "Why,  in  England,  to  be  sure!"  announced  some  divine  inspiration.   And  that  is  how  this  "the  English  are  very  much  with  us"  business  began.   Now,  Hollywood  is  nothing  if  not  thorough-  going. If  English  it  was  to  be,  Hollywood  was  determined,  with  that  glint  in  its  eye  which  brooks  no  denial,  that  things  be  very,  very  English  indeed.   13  ROAD  A's;  Savile  Row  and  Bond  Street  •'-'accoutrements;  butlers  and  footmen;  early  morning  tea,  and  tea  with  milk  at  four  o'clock;  horsey  and  doggy  conversations;  and  an  im-  perturbable poise  which  not  even  an  earth-  quake could  upset — were  to  be  the  order  of  the  day.   The  studios  have  gone  to  no  end  of  trouble  to  see  that  productions  live  up  to  what  is  known  as  "good  form"  in  merrie  England.

In  other  words,  he's  a  male  Emily  Post.   Then  there's  a  lady  who  does  much  the  same  thing.  'Twas  whispered  she  was  Keeper  of  Queen  Mary's  Robes.  She  watches  with  a  hawk's  eye  such  details  as  the  setting  of  a  table.  For  what  would  be  said  by  people  in  the  know  if  "sweets"  (dessert  to  you!)  were  not  served  both  with  a  spoon  and  a  fork!  What,  indeed?   Yet,  despite  all  the  bustling  precautions  of  these  etiquette  engineers,  British  Clive  Brook  made  a  slip-up.   TT  had  to  do  with  a  scene  in  "Shanghai  Ex-  press," in  which  a  highly-polished,  highly-  commissioned  British  officer  succumbs  to  the  orchid  and  feathery  wiles  of  Shanghai  Lily  (Marlene  Dietrich).   Sometime  during  its  first  winter,  there  was  a  very  hoity-toity  benefit  performance  of  "Shanghai  Express"  in  London.  In  the  box  reserved  for  royalty  sat  Prince  George  (yes,  the  very  same  Prince  George  who  was  entertained  by  Doug  and  Mary  at  Pickfair),  with  the  Duke  of  Connaught  and  a  young  newspaper  woman.  She  was,  to  put  it  mildly,  ill  at  ease.  Being  left  alone  with  two  such  luminaries  is  trying.  Even  to  a  newspaper  woman.   In  accordance  with  that  fine  old  English  custom,  not  a  word  was  spoken  by  anyone  during  the  entire  show.  Three  solid  hours,  in-  termission included!  And  since  a  gentlewoman  shouldn't  speak  to  a  prince  unless  a  prince  first  speaks  to  her,  the  distraught  journalist  main-  tained a  desolate  silence.   Finally,  the  endurance  test  was  at  an  end.  The  lady  rose.  So  did  Prince  George.  He  helped  her  on  with  her  wrap.  Still,  that  glacial  restraint.  Then  quietly,  His  Highness  turned  to  the  Duke  of  Connaught.  And  with  these  words,  he  covered  the  recently-viewed  picture  with  sod:   "No  English  officer  would  have  changed  into  full  mess  kit  in  a  railway  carriage!"  said  he.  That  was  the  only  comment  made.  And  that  was  certainly  that!   Don't  tell  me  you  haven't  heard  of  Holly-  wood's Cricket  Club?  With  its  roster  of  im-  pressive names  that  include  a  baronet,  a  knight,  the  British  Consul  and  an  array  of  important  motion  picture  names?   A  ND  do  they  take  their  cricket  seriously?  ■**-Last  summer  there  was  a  test  match  between  the  distinguished  Hollywood  team  and  the  champion  Australian  Olympic  team.  After  seeing  it,  no  less  a  sports  enthusiast  than  Doug  Fairbanks,  Sr.,  went  about  contending  that  America  had  been  overlooking  a  sport  "what  was  a  sport" !   Immediately  a  large  studio  took  the  hint  and  made  an  educational  "short"  to  show  the  world  how  cricket  should  be  played.  Not  to  be  outdone,  the  city  of  Los  Angeles  announced  its  intention  of  presenting  a  new  cricket  park  to  its  English  guests.   This  ambitious  playground  is  under  con-  struction right  now.   Then  there's  that  other  new  game  that  took  Hollywood  by  storm.  Everyone  believed  it  to  be  a  special  invention  of  Doug,  Sr.,  when  he  sprung  it  upon  Hollywood  several  years  ago  after  a  visit  to  England.  He  called  it  Doug-al-  Dyas.   Hollywood  responded  with  childlike  enthu-  siasm, as  Hollywood  usually  does.   Sometime  later,  an  Englishman  casually  re-  marked that  what  everyone  seemed  so  hot  and  bothered  about  strongly  resembled  a  game  he  used  to  play  on  the  village  green.  The  name  he  was  accustomed  to  call  it  was  badminton,  although  it  had  been  better  known  to  hearty,  ale-drinking  English  squires  for  generations  back  as  plain  battledore  and  shuttlecock.   Now  badminton  is  a  near-relation  of  tennis —  but  a  much  less  strenuous  sport.  None  the  less,  Harpo  Marx  has  gone  violently  badminton  and  indulges  in  exciting  doubles  matches  with    Anita  Page,  Martha  Sleeper  and  John  Risso,  the  "pro"  tennis  player.   Among  other  badminton  converts  and  ex-  perts are  Marion  Da  vies;  Clark  Gable;  the  Senior  Fairbanks  (Doug  and  Mary),  the  Junior  Fairbanks  (Doug,  Jr.  and  Joan  Craw-  ford); the  Gene  Markeys  (Joan  Bennett);  the  John  Barrymores;  the  John  Considines,  the  Charles  Mac  Arthurs  (Helen  Hayes).   And  when  it  comes  to  plumbing  the  depths  of  subtle  gallantry,  of  tender,  whimsical  love-  making,  those  two  past-masters,  Leslie  Howard  and  Herbert  Marshall,  have  actually  ushered  in  a  new  breed  of  screen  lover.   There's  no  need  to  wonder,  no  room  for  argument,  since  Leslie  conquered  the  citadel  of  female  emotions  in  "Devotion."  Just  unani-  mous, fluttering,  breath-catching  acclamation  from  the  majority  of  movie-going  ladies  in  the  land.   According  to  them,  he's  "a  more  dangerous  male  than  twenty  hairy-chested  rogues."   After  that  red-letter  performance,  untold  scores  of  women  broke  down  and  confessed  that  his  unique  brand  of  restrained  love-  making,  so  full  of  delicious  raillery  and  banter,  makes  all  "knock-'em-down-and-drag- 'em-out"  antics  appear  a  trifle  obvious.   "NTOT  so  long  ago  that  same  golden-haired  boy  ■*-^  (Leslie's  every  bit  of  thirty-nine  and  has  a  fourteen-year-old  son)  was  talking  to  me  about  this  and  that  on  the  RKO-Radio  lot.  Waiting,  in  his  dressing-room,  for  a  call  to  work  on  another  of  those  Howard-Harding  love  scenes  in  "The  Animal  Kingdom."   "How  do  you  explain  this  sudden  Holly-  wood passion  for  everything  British?  "  I  asked  him.   The  golden-haired  boy  with  oh-what-a-smile  leaned  against  his  dressing-room  table  and  mused.   "It  all  seems  to  me  to  go  back  to  the  differ-  ence in  the  attitude  of  America  and  England  toward  the  acting  profession,"  he  answered.   "  For  instance,  my  friends  in  New  York  used  to  consider  an  acting  chap — well,  not  exactly  a  red-blooded  he-man.  And  certainly  not  a  gentleman.   "In  England,  on  the  other  hand,  acting  is  an  honorable  profession.  A  gentleman's  job.  As  well  as  a  man's  job.   "The  type  of  Englishman  who  takes  up  act-  ing as  his  life's  work  is  most  often  like  the  American  chap  who  goes  in  for  banking  or  law.  Well-bred.    Well-educated."   He  smiled  half  apologetically,  as  if  it  might  sound  too  much  like  boasting  to  imply  that  he  was  "that  sort  of  English  chap."   "For  that  very  reason,"  he  continued,  "an  English  actor  is  perhaps  better  equipped  to  contribute  the  necessary  polish,  finesse  and  restraint  demanded  today  by  the  new  standard  of  dialogue  pictures."   "Quite,"  said  I.  "And  now  do  tell  me  what  you  think  of  the  social  side  of  this  British  busi-  ness? Do  you  think  we  do  it  well?  Or  does  it  sometimes  seem  just  a  little  bit  funny  to  you,  Mr.  Howard?"   "We-11— uh,  there's  the  Cricket  Club,"  he  commenced,  hedging  in  the  inimitably  discreet  British  manner.  "And  there's  that  large  and  active  organization,  The  Daughters  of  the  British  Empire.  You  know,"  he  continued  brightly,  obviously  praying  to  shift  the  subject,  "they  have  a  passion  for  your  climate.  They  dote  on  your  sunshine."   ""DUT,  Mr.  Howard,"  I  insisted,  "you  still   -'-'haven't  told  me  what  you  think  of  Holly-  wood, real  Hollywood  going  British."   He  smiled  enigmatically.  I  smiled  en-  couragingly.   We  both  smiled  audibly.   Again  he  wavered.  Then  flashed  that  smile  which  speaks  volumes  without  an  uttered  syllable — and  these  words,  spoken  from  the  heart.   "You  see,  I  jolly  well  couldn't!"  .  .  .  Whereupon  he  grinned  broadly,  and  hastily  departed  to  look  at  some  "rush"  pictures  of  a  recent  scene.

ONCE  when  I  had  the  chance,  I  asked  Mike  what  trait  she  admired  most  in  Andy,  aside  from  the  ones  that  meet  the  eye.   She  thought  for  a  moment.  "Andy's  a  funny  boy.   "He  gives  the  best  he  has  to  whatever  he  is  doing — and  when  he  finishes  it,  he  never  looks  back.   "For  instance,  we  went  to  the  preview  of  'The  Man  From  Yesterday. '   "Naturally,  all  the  actors  were  watching  their  performances  intently.  All  but  Andy.  He  was  sound  asleep.   "Andy  never  says  'Look  what  I  did.'  He  never  even  says  'Look  what  I'm  doing.'  He  just  does  it."   YOU'D  guess  that  if  you  saw  him  the  other  day,  when  he  lumbered  into  the  Universal  restaurant,  just  off  the  set  from  playing  what  he  calls  "the  lion's  chambermaid"  in  "The  Big  Cage."   His  circus  uniform  had  all  the  snug,  neat  fit  of  an  elephant's  hide,  and  he  wore  a  pair  of  enormous  rubber  overshoes.   "What  size  are  those  things?"  we  asked,  fascinated  with  the  idea  that  any  one  man  should  carry  them  around.   "Oh,  I  wouldn't  know.  They're  over  size  twelve  shoes."   He  took  off  the  funny  looking  helmet,  and  the  mane  of  shaggy  hair  escaped  back  into    Wide  World    Hi-ho  there,  Tony  Moreno.

Photoplay  Magazine  for  April,  1933   his  eyes,  while  the  rear  fringe  draped  over  his  collar.   "I've  been  looking  forward — or  rather,  my  girl  has — to  the  day  when  I  could  get  a  hair-  cut. Said  she  couldn't  tell  which  one  was  the  lion.

"    And  Andy  roars  with  good-natured  laughter.   That's  Andy.  Out-size,  ponderous,  happy-  natured  kid — with  the  rare  sweetness  of  an  unspoiled  child — and  a  strong  undercurrent  of  sensitive,  susceptible  Irishman.  He  lives  life  in  an  easy  measured  tempo — never  hurried,  never  important.  Imagine  Andy  going  tem-  peramental! Imagine  Queen  Mary  doing  a  rhumba!    My  Sister,  Ann  Harding    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  33    and  live  with  them.  Ann  had  sense  enough  to  take  her  advice  that  she  look  upon  a  summer  of  stock  as  a  valuable  lesson  in  the  A-B-C's  of  this  trade  upon  which  she  was  embarking.  So  Ann  went  back  to  the  manager  very  humbly  and  said  that  if  the  spot  were  still  available  she  would  be  glad  to  take  it,  pro-  vided they  would  cover  up  her  hair  and  find  out  whether  or  not  she  could  act.  The  request  was  fulfilled  with  a  vengeance — her  first  part  was  that  of  a  colored  maid!   Although  living  expenses  were  cut  down  to  a  minimum,  it  took  strict  adherence  to  a  budget  to  make  the  books  balance  each  week.  Wash-  ing and  ironing  all  her  clothes,  sometimes  going  without  sufficient  food  in  order  to  provide  her  costumes,  saving  precious  nickels  and  dimes  by  walking  instead  of  riding  whenever  possible  — these  and  a  hundred  other  economies  be-  came second  nature  to  her.   From  this  stock  engagement  Ann  came  back  to  Broadway,  having  saved  enough  to  live  during  final  rehearsals  of  "Like  A  King."  The  play  was  a  two-week  flop  in  New  York.   Her  next  engagement  with  "The  Lonely  Heart"  played  one  week  in  Baltimore  and  closed  forever.  However,  as  soon  as  it  was  known  that  she  was  free,  she  was  sent  for  and  offered  a  star  part.  The  manager  gave  her  the  part  book.   She  glanced  through  the  pages  and,  finding  eighty-five  "sides,"  handed  it  back  to  him,  shaking  her  head.   "I'm  afraid  I'm  not  ready  to  carry  eighty-  five  sides  of  anything  so  that  it  would  be  interesting,"  she  told  him,  quite  frankly.   "Read  it  to  me,  Ann,  and  let  me  decide,"  suggested  the  manager.   "No,"  she  replied  definitely,  "I  happen  to  be  quite  teachable  and  you  could  probably  train  me  to  play  the  part  so  that  it  would  not  hurt  the  play,  but  I  don't  know  enough  about  acting  for  it  to  do  me  any  good  personally."   JASPER  DEETER  had  done  his  job  well—  J  he  had  not  only  directed  her  into  a  superb  performance  in  "Inheritors,"  on  the  strength  of  which  she  received  all  subsequent  offers  during  the  next  four  years,  but  he  had  im-  planted in  her  mind  his  theory  that  greatness  as  an  actor  could  never  be  attained  through  a  parrot-like  mimicry.  Her  attitude  in  refusing  many  of  these  parts  was,  of  course,  incom-  prehensible to  the  managers,  as  was  her  refusal  to  be  starred;  but  she  knew  that  she  was  not  ready.  After  a  few  experiences  of  this  nature  she  decided  she  might  better  go  back  for  another  season  of  stock.  Her  one  thought  now  was  to  build  the  foundation  firmly,  to  go  slowly,  but  in  the  right  direction,  until  she  should  reach  the  top  through  a  logical  process  of  develop-  ment. With  this  in  view,  Ann  accepted  the  standing  offer  to  return  to  the  same  stock  company,  this  time  as  ingenue  in  Providence,  for  the  Winter  season.   From  ingenue  in  Providence  she  went  straight  to  Detroit  as  leading  woman,  filling  the  place  left  vacant  by  Katherine  Cornell.  In  Detroit  she  was  so  underpaid  that  she  could  not  possibly  afford  to  buy  the  numerous  gowns  required  from  week  to  week,  so  she  sat  up  until  three  or  four  o'clock  in  the  morn-  ing sewing  and  learning  lines.    As  the  average    weekly  wardrobe  items  were  an  afternoon  dress,  negligee,  suit,  hat,  shoes,  accessories,  two  evening  dresses,  an  evening  wrap  and  a  coat,  every  week  found  her  still  sewing  frantically  during  the  Monday  rehearsal  for  that  night's  opening.  She  played  through  many  illnesses,  even  insisting  upon  doing  "Peter  Pan"  with  a  broken  ankle!  That  year  of  stock  broke  down  her  unbelievably  magnificent  constitution  and  called  upon  reserves  which  she  may  never  get  back.   "pINALLY  she  completely  lost  her  voice —  *-  there  was  nothing  left  but  a  croak.  Never  having  received  instruction  in  how  to  place  the  voice  properly,  it  had  finally  failed  her — and  nearly  cost  her  an  engagement  on  Broadway  which  marked  a  turning  point  in  her  career.  She  had  received  a  wire  from  John  Cromwell,  who  wanted  to  talk  to  her  about  playing  in  "Tar-  nish." He  remembered  her  in  "Inheritors,"  two  years  before.  Ann  came  into  New  York  and  talked  with  him  and  Gilbert  Emery,  the  author,  but  the  sound  of  her  voice  came  to  them  as  a  shock,  to  say  the  least.  They  practically  withdrew  the  offer  but,  after  a  lengthy  conference,  decided  to  give  her  the  part  providing  she  could  recapture  the  voice  in  time  to  play  it.  On  the  strength  of  very  good  advice,  she  went  to  Samuel  Kayser,  who  resuscitated  the  lovely  voice.   With  two  solid  years  of  stock  to  her  credit,  Ann  felt  that  now  she  should  be  able  to  handle  the  part  of  Tishic  in  "Tarnish";  moreover,  it  was  not  a  star  part,  but  one  of  five  equally  good  ones.  The  play  went  into  rehearsal  in  the  Spring  and  out  on  the  road  for  the  usual  two  week  tryout.   After  the  tryout  she  was  fired.  This  was  not  the  Tishic  they  wanted — where  was  Madeline?  Who  was  this  new  girl  who  ran  through  her  lines  very  deftly  and  superficially,  but  failed  to  catch  at  the  hearts  of  the  audience  with  that  breath-taking  quality  that  had  been  hers?   In  the  bewilderment  of  defeat,  Ann  went  to  Deeter  to  find  out  why  she  had  failed.  She  found  him  living  with  his  sister  in  Rose  Valley.  Pennsylvania,  and,  as  usual  in  finding  "Jap,"  found  a  theater.  He  had  put  on  "Candida"  with  whatever  local  talent  he  could  find,  in  an  old  mill  which  had  been  converted  (more  or  less)  into  a  theater.   SHE  confessed  that  she  had  been  let  out  of  the  cast  of  "Tarnish,"  concluding  with  the  admission  that  it  was  probably  quite  just,  and  that  she  deserved  it.  However,  she  told  him  that  she  felt  she  would  never  be  an  actress  if  all  the  work  she  had  done  in  stock  had  not  been  enough  to  teach  her  her  job.  And  then  she  learned  from  Deeter  that  stock  had  taught  her  facility,  many  tricks,  unworthy  short-  cuts to  an  effect,  but  that  in  the  space  of  those  two  years  she  had  already  begun  to  destroy  in  herself  the  thing  that  was  acting.  In  order  to  bring  her  back  to  the  original  feeling  of  her  remarkable  performance  at  the  Provincetown  Playhouse,  he  called  his  skeleton  troupe  together  and  put  on  "Inheritors."  That  performance  marked  the  birth  of  the  Hedgerow  Theater.  She  once  again  discovered  the  joy  of  meaning  what  slie  said  before  she    Photoplay  Magazine  for  April,  1933    spoke  from  a  stage,  instead  of  spouting  words  like  a  parrot.   Just  as  Jap  was  about  to  close  the  theater  for  the  Fall,  along  came  a  wire  from  New  York,  to  the  startling  effect  that  she  was  to  open  cold  on  Broadway  in   "Tarnish."   Gilbert  Emery,  with  an  author's  power  of  veto,  had  refused  to  sanction  any  other  casting  in  the  part.  She  returned  to  the  cast  with  an  entirely  different  performance,  not  only  on  account  of  Deeter's  specific  coaching  in  that  very  part,  but  with  a  growth  in  acting  which  had  taken  place  during  that  unforgettable  summer  at  Hedgerow.   "Tarnish"  proved  a  smash  hit  overnight.  Ann  was  the  talk  of  the  town  with  the  one  performance.  I  remember  the  notices — one  critic  was  forced  to  resort  to  poetry  at  the  end  of  his  review — banner  headlines  in  all  the  papers.  All  Ann  remembers  of  that  opening  night  and  the  wave  of  praise,  the  tumult  and  the  shouting,  was  Deeter's  hands  roughly  shaking  her  shoulders,  his  eyes  glaring,  as  he  shouted  above  the  din —   "The  town  may  be  crazy  about  you,  but  you  gave  them  a  damn  sight  less  than  /  expected!"   rT"0  Ann's  way  of  thinking,  that  meant  she  had  -*■  missed  fire,  and  the  fact  that  she  had  fallen  short  of  all  he  required  of  her  as  an  artist  made  the  praises  of  New  York  seem  nothing.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  she  was  ridiculously  well  cast;  her  faults  happened  to  be  virtues  in  that  particular  role.  But  she  had  needed  the  brake  of  Deeter's  criticism  and  the  next  performance  was  such  an  improvement  upon  the  first  that  Ann  ceased  to  worry  and  gave  her  entire  thought  to  putting  all  she  had  into  the  part.   Ann  went  from  "Tarnish"  into  "The  Horse  Thief,"  with  George  Marion,  which  opened  in    Chicago,  had  a  successful  run  in  that  city,  but  was  rewritten  and  retitled  "Thoroughbreds"  for  New  York,  where  it  failed  to  arouse  the  interest  of  the  theater-going  public  and  closed  after  a  short  run.  She  knew  full  well  she  would  be  panned  in  it,  which  she  was,  very  thoroughly.  One  of  the  kindest  of  the  criti-  cisms ran — "Ann  Harding  played  the  girl —  — we  liked  her  in  'Tarnish.'  "   """THAT  settled  the  question — she  knew  that  she  ■*-  needed  more  intensive  work  at  Hedgerow  with  Deeter.  As  a  person,  she  had  never  known  an  established  home  as  most  people  know  it — the  nomadic  wanderings  of  an  Army  family  preclude  that  precious  taking  of  root  in  one  memory-crowded  spot.  But  as  an  actress,  "Hedgerow"  implies  to  Ann  all  that  the  other  means  to  those  who  have  known  a  home.  Whenever  she  was  hurt,  bewildered  or  lost  in  this  world  of  the  theater,  there  was  just  one  haven,  one  clear  solution  to  the  puzzle —  "Hedgerow."   So,  the  night  that  the  play  closed  she  was  all  packed  up,  her  suitcase  was  stowed  into  her  dilapidated  roadster  and  after  the  perfor-  mance she  set  out  at  midnight  for  Philadel-  phia and  Hedgerow,  leaving  no  forwarding  address    behind    her.    Weary,  dejected,  Ann  finds  peace  and  renewed  spirit  in  Hedgerow — then,  the  following  spring,  began  her  real  climb  to  enduring  fame.  How  she  won  ac-  claim on  the  stage — her  meeting  and  marriage  with  Harry  Bannister — and  how  she  was  all  but  pitch-forked  into  the  movies,  while  recovering  from  the  birth  of  her  child — these  will  be  told  next  month.    After  being  fired  as  artificial  from  the  cast  of  "Tarnish,"  Ann  spent  a  summer  training,  was  given  another  chance — and  proved  a  sensation  in  her  first  real  Broadway  appearance.  Here  is  one  of  the  tense  moments  in  that  success — when  she  learns  the  truth  about  Emmett  (Tom  Powers),  and  is  struggling  to  remember  that  when  all  was  said  and  done,  "men  are  a  bad  lot,  and  dirty,  too ;  the  thing  to  do  is  to  find  one  that  cleans  easy"    rater    away  nru   Q/Jutt,'/   I  won't  let  Gray  Hair  spoil  my  fun   Without  mercy,  gray  hair  steals  your  richest  treasures  .  .  .  youth,  beauty  .  .  .  deprives  you  of  the  admiration  that  makes  life  a  spirited  adventure.

"Here,  wipe  your  tears  on  my  hanky."   "  My  Gawd,  my  Gawd,"  Jack  mumbles  with  numb  lips.   Ina  is  briskly  carving  the  roast.   "Virginia,  dearest,"  she  admonishes,  "this  meat  is  too  rare."   "Oh,  what  is  so  rare  as  a  roast  in  June?"  Perkins  flips,  fully  recovered  and  skipping  merrily  around  and  around  the  table.   "My  Gawd,  my  Gawd,"  breathes  Jack.   "TDERKINS,  leave  the  room,"  Leatrice  com-  -*-  mands  while  Jack  reaches  over  and,  with  a  shaking  and  trembling  arm  pours  the  cold  gravy  over  his  still  throbbing  head.   "  Rare  meat  always  made  Jack  do  a  nip-up,"  Ina  explains.   "It  was  oysters,"  Leatrice  contradicts,  "oysters  in  Worcestershire  sauce.  I  remember  well  the  night — "   "It  was  beef — rare,"  Ina  flings  back.  "I  remember  several  nights."   "It  was—"   "My  Gawd,  my  Gawd,"  Jack  groans.   Ina  and  Leatrice  finish  the  roast.   "You  see,  dear,"  Ina  explains  to  Virginia,  "we  thought  it  only  fair,  Leatrice  and  I,  to  give  you  (being  the  sweet  thing  you  are)  the  benefit  of  our  knowledge  and  experience  as  Gilbert  wives.   "Now,  Virginia,  about  not  letting  him  roam  through  his  cactus  garden  in  his  bare  feet — I  believe  I  would  if  I  were  you.  It  only  ag-  gravates John  to  be  crossed."   "And  double-crossed — "  Leatrice  advises.  "We  never  double-crossed  Jack,  no  matter  what—"   "You  mean  re-doubled,  don't  you?"  Ina  asked.  "For  instance,  if  you  have  four  no  trump  in  your  hand — "   "My  Gawd,  my  Gawd,"  mumbles  John.   The  butler  staggers  in  with  the  dessert.  Custard  tarts  with  whipped  cream.   "Divine,"  Ina  squeals,  biting  a  piece  out  of  Jack's  tart.  "But,  dearest  Virginia,  it's  too  sweet.     Sweets  always  gave  John  the  burps."   "Ina,  dear,  don't  be  vulgar,"  Leatrice  re-  marks from  her  chair  arm.   "Vulgar,"  screeches  Ina.  "Why  even  the  Barrymores  have  burps,"  and  instantly  the  place  is  a  riot  of  confusion.  On  one  side  of  the  table  are  Ina  and  Leatrice.  On  the  other,  Jack,  Virginia  and  Perkins.   Tarts  are  flying  madly  from  Ina  to  Jack,  Jack  to  Leatrice.   The  faces  of  the  contestants  are  whipped  cream  from  forehead  to  chin.   TARTS,  huge  ones,  piled  with  whipped  cream  come  tripping  in  from  the  kitchen  to  join  in  the  fray.   They  leap  upon  the  tortured  Jack.  They  shake  him.   "Sir,  sir — "  their  voices  say,  toning  down  from  high  squeaks  to  a  soft  whisper.   "Sir— it's  time  you  were  up.  You're  due  at  the  studio  in  half  an  hour."   Jack  awakes  and  looks  about  startled.   Perkins  is  bending  over  him.   "I've  been  trying  to  wake  you,  sir,"  he  says.  "It's  very  late."   "  I've  had  a  dream,"  Jack  groans.  "A  hor-  rible dream,  Perkins."   "  Yes,  sir.  I  expect  it  was  too  many  oysters,  sir.  In  Worcestershire  sauce.  And  then  the  beef  was  a  bit  rare,  sir,  and  that  tart  with  whipped  cream —   "Don't,  don't,"  pleads  Jack,  "don't  ever  mention  tarts  with  whipped  cream.   "  My  Gawd,  my  Gawd,"  he  groans  and  groans  and  then  sinks  back  in  the  pillows,  reaching  out  with  trembling  hand  for  the  decanter  of  ice-  water.  Which  he  poured  over  his  aching,  feverish  head.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  April,  1933    How  Sylvia  Changed  "Carol  of  the  Curves   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  SO  ]    You'll  notice  that  I  occasionally  let  her  have  a  tiny  piece  of  angel  cake  or,  as  I  just  told  you,  the  prune  whip.  But  in  each  case  it  was  very  little;  a  rare  treat.  That  tiny  bit  occasionally  won't  hurt  you — but  you've  got  to  use  dis-  cretion.   CAROLE  was  one  of  those  grand,  happy-go-  lucky  persons.  And  everybody  loved  her.  From  the  time  she  first  came  into  my  room  to  be  treated  until  she  left,  the  telephone  was  ringing  constantly;  people  asking  for  her.  From  the  errand  boys  to  the  actors,  they  all  loved  her.  She  didn't  take  herself  or  anybody  else  seriously.  She  had  a  grand,  cheerful  grin.  She  was  always  ready  for  a  party.  She  loved  to  dance  and  laugh  and  Fm  telling  you  that's  half  the  battle  in  being  beautiful  and  lovely.   Then  I  heard  that  her  contract  had  not  been  renewed,  and  the  way  she  took  it  is  a  wonderful  example  for  everyone.  I  saw  her  the  morning  she  was  told.   "Hello,  darling,  how  do  you  feel?"  I  asked.   "I  feel  great,"  she  said.  "This  is  the  best  thing  that  ever  happened  to  me.  There  are  two  other  blondes  of  about  my  type  on  this  lot.    Fll  do  much  better  somewhere  else."   I  knew  that  she  was  just  putting  up  a  brave  front.  But  her  prophesy  came  true.  She  did  do  much  better  somewhere  else.  So  just  take  Carole's  attitude  for  your  own.  In  Holly-  wood— or  anywhere  else — you  can't  let  people  see  when  you're  down.  Keep  a  stiff  upper  lip.  Believe  me,  that  attitude  will  do  more  to  give  your  face  character  and  even  real  beauty  than  anything  I  know.  As  for  your  figure — well,  you've  got  to  work  on  that!   And  here's  the  funny  part  about  Carole  Lombard.  No — I'll  take  that  back.  It  isn't  funny,  it's  grand.  She  never  put  on  fat  again.  Because — she  used  her  common  sense!  Even  after  she  left  me  she  kept  up  exercises  for  re-  ducing. She  danced  a  lot,  which  is  a  fine  re-  ducer.    And  she  was  sensible  about  her  food.    She  did  not  have  to  stay  on  a  strict  diet;  she  just  had  to  be  sensible,  choose  her  foods  well,  and  not  overeat.  Gosh — how  I  wish  I  could  train  all  you  girls  to  do  that.  And  I  wish  I  could  train  you  to  work  as  Carole  did  to  get  thin.   The  kid  used  to  scream  while  I  was  giving  her  a  treatment.  Bill  Boyd's  dressing-room  was  right  next  to  my  treating  bungalow.  He  and  Bob  Armstrong  used  to  yell  out,  "Don't  tell  me  you're  doing  that  for  your  art's  sake. "   "She's  doing  it  for  art's  sake  and  for  my  sake  and  for  her  own  sake,"  I  used  to  yell  back.   Carole  reduced  because  she  had  to.  You  see,  they  decided — before  I  came  on  the  lot —  that  she  should  be  a  dramatic  actress  instead  of  a  Sennett  girl.  They  gave  her  a  test  and  her  acting  was  fine — but  her  figure!  That  was  her  incentive  to  get  thin.  She  knew  she  would  never  succeed  on  the  screen  unless  she  was  thin.  After  she  was  thin,  it  is  true  that  her  first  big  dramatic  part  was  in  a  terrible  picture.  It  wasn't  her  fault  that  the  picture  was  bad  and  her  contract  wasn't  renewed.  But  now — look  at  her.  She  isn't  afraid  of  the  biggest  dramatic  part  they  can  hand  her!   ""["HERE'S  just  one  more  thing  that  I  want  to  *■  tell  you  about  Carole.  She  had  been  in  a  very  bad  automobile  accident  before  she  came  to  that  studio.  It  had  left  a  scar  on  her  cheek.  Did  she  cry  and  moan  about  it?  She  did  not.  She  didn't  pay  any  attention  to  it — but  went  right  on.   And  because  of  her  attitude  I  tell  you  that  scar  is  actually  attractive.   Believe  me,  you  girls  and  women  can  learn  a  lot  from  Carole.   And — what's  more — if  you  want  to  be  the  Lombard  type  don't  forget  that  you  can  re-  duce from  a  size  sixteen  to  a  twelve.  I  know  — because  I  did  it  for  Carole  and,  if  you  will  follow  my  instructions,  I  can  do  the  same  for  you !    Answers  By  Sylvia    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  80    ting  very  little  results.    Can  you  give  me  some  other  exercise?   A.  M.  N.,  Biloxi,  Miss.   Just  those  exercises  alone  won't  do  the  trick.  You've  got  to  build  up  all  over  your  body.  Follow  the  building-up  diet  which  you  have  probably  already  read  and — this  is  really  im-  portant— go  to  bed  by  nine  o'clock  three  nights  a  week.   Get  just  as  much  sleep  as  you  can — nine  or  even  ten  hours  a  night.  But  keep  up  the  exercises.   You  should  put  on  weight  and  then  shape  your  legs  with  the  exercises.   Dear  Sylvia:   I  have,  thanks  to  you,  lost  a  lot  of  weight  and  am  down  to  an  almost  perfect  36,  but  I  have  lost  considerable  in  my  face  and  neck.  Kindly  advise  what  to  do  for  a  skinny  neck  and  face.   M.  S.,  Chicago,  111.   Isn't  it  swell  that  you've  lost  weight?  Now  you  see — you  other  girls — it  can  be  done.  Now  that  you've  lost  the  weight  you  must  begin  to  work  on  your  face  and  neck.  To  build  up  the  neck  spread  a  generous  amount  of  cold  cream  on  your  hands.  With  the  palm  of  your  left  hand  rub  down  on  your  neck  from  the  tip  of  the    chin  to  the  chest.  Then  rub  up  with  the  back  of  your  right  hand  from  the  chest  to  the  tip  of  the  chin.   Then  slap  your  chin  with  the  backs  of  both  hands.    This  will  make  the  neck  firm.   Now  for  your  face.  Use  plenty  of  cold  cream  and  massage  with  the  tips  of  the  fingers  in  a  rotary  movement  from  the  point  of  the  chin  to  just  below  the  cheek  bones  right  at  the  ears.  At  this  point  press  hard,  making  your  fingers  tremble,  like  a  vibrator.  This  stimulates  the  entire  face.   Press  in  the  same  way  on  the  bone  at  the  outer  corners  of  the  eyes,  and  then  very  gently  massage  the  outer  corners  of  the  eyes  with  a  rotary  movement.   When  you've  done  all  that,  wipe  all  the  cold  cream  off,  bathe  the  face  in  lukewarm  water  and  then  wear  out  a  chunk  of  ice  rubbing  on  your  face  and  neck.   Dear  Sylvia:   Does  it  hurt  to  wear  girdles?  I  am  awfully  thin  and  my  clothes  look  much  better  with  a  girdle,  but  have  been  wondering  if  they  are  harmful.   V.  L.  B.,  Chicago,  111.   By  all  means  wear  your  girdle.  A  good  foundation  garment  is  absolutely  necessary  to  any  woman  who  wants  a  beautiful  figure.    How  Do   Sportswomen   Manage?   Cup  winners  can't  be  quitters — what-  ever the  time  of  month.  The  woman  who  competes  for  honors  in  any  field  of  sport  must  take  her  sporting  chance  with  Nature.  Any  strenuous  match  may  sud-  denly bring  on  her  sickness.  A  busy  season  of  practice  and  play  makes  no  allowance  for  discomfort  or  pain  of  menstruation.  Midol  will  meet  this  emergency  —  as  many  active  women  know.  Midol  tablets  have  emancipated  women  from  the  dread  of  regular  pain — from  the  need  of  giving  in  to  such  suffering — from  suffering  at  all.   Do  you  realize  that  a  woman  who  takes  Midol  just  before  her  time  to  suffer  will  menstruate  without  one  twinge  of  pain?  That  even  though  the  pains  have  caught  her  unawares,  Midol  will  stop  them  with-  in seven  minutes?  And  that  Midol  is  as  harmless  as  the  aspirin  vou  take  for  a  headache?   No  matter  how  hard  a  time  you  have  always  had,  Midol  carries  you  through  your  monthly  periods  in  perfect  comfort.  Don't  stand  in  the  dark.  Don't  doubt  a  discovery  which  has  been  verified  by  the  medical  profession  and  proven  to  the  satisfaction  of  more  than  a  million  women.  Your  druggist  has  these  tablets  in  a  slim  little  box  that  fits  the  smallest  purse  or  pocket.  Just  ask  for  Midol.    io8    Photoplay  Magazine  for  April,  1933    wp\WVW«H"ll»»W//^v  '  "ff/ffi    STAF^    H    The  screen's  greatest  celebrities  have  honored  Hotel  Sherman.

But  I  don't  mind,  really.  I  feel  so  strongly  about  it.  Every  word  I  say  about  it,  comes  right  from  the  heart."   As  if  we,  who  had  listened,  hadn't  felt  it.   CHE  was  off  for  another  retake.  ^  Somehow,  you  would  know  by  just  looking  at  Diana  Wynyard,  that  anything  she  decided  to  do,  would  be  done  right.  And  in  the  proper  manner.  Without  any  mistakes,  or  flutter-  budgeting  about.   So,  after  a  surprising  success  in  a  school  play,  Diana  decided  to  be  an  actress.   And  set  about  being  one  in  a  straight-for-  ward, business-like  way.   She  talked  it  over  quietly  with  her  family,  who  agreed  she  should  try  it.   After  graduation,  she  hired  a  private  tutor  and,  day  after  day,  hour  after  hour,  she  studied  stage  technique.  She  learned  what  to  do  with  her  hands.  With  her  voice.  How  to  walk  on  and  off.  How  to  get  the  most  out  of  every  line.  Every  word.  And  then  she  was  ready  for  her  debut.  But  not  as  a  star,  remember.  Or  a  featured  player.  No,  not  even  as  a  bit  player.  Diana  made  her  debut  as  one  of  the  guests  in  the  cabaret  scene  of  "The  Grand  Duchess."  That  was  all.    Just  one  of  the  mob.   Then  she  felt  ready  for  a  stock  company.  So,  for  forty  weeks,  she  toured  England  with  a  traveling  stock  company,  playing  forty  differ-  ent roles  in  the  forty  weeks.   More  months  of  touring  about  with  second  companies,  followed  her  stock  experience.  And  then,  she  was  ready  for  leads  on  the  London  stage.  And  ready  is  the  word.  Her  first  success  came  with  Walter  Hackett  in  "Sorry  You've  Been  Troubled,"  and  when  a  single  benefit  performance  of  "The  Devil  Passes"  was  given,  Diana  was  invited  to  play  the  lead.   "If  you  ever  decide  to  produce  this  play,"  she  asked  them,  "may  I  have  the  lead?"  So  that  is  presumably  how  Diana  Wynyard  came  to  America  in  "The  Devil  Passes."  And  how,  when  the  movies  spotted  her,  she  came  to  Hollywood  for  "Rasputin"  and  "Cavalcade."   In  between  making  "Cavalcade,"  she  dashed  back  and  forth  to  the  M-G-M  studios  for  rehearsals  and  retakes  of  "  Rasputin"  with  the  Barrymores.  Certainly  you  remember  the  story  of  how  that  went  on  and  on,  far  into  the  night.  And  when  "Cavalcade"  was  com-  pleted, she  went  right  into  the  cast  of  "Men  Must  Fight."   SUDDENLY  a  messenger  from  the  publicity  department.  "  Your  speech  for  tonight,  Miss  Wynyard,"  he  said.  ,   "Speech?"  she  asked  him  in  alarm.   "  Yes,  it's  what  you're  to  say  over  the  radio."   "But,  I  only  wanted  to  say  how  grateful  I  am  to  be  in  'Cavalcade,'  "  she  said.   Her  opening!  Her  big  night!  The  premiere  of  "Cavalcade."    We  had  forgotten  it.   Again  we  were  plunged  into  the  late  after-  noon excitement  that  precedes  a  huge  opening.  Smart  gray  trucks  from  smart  flower  shops  were  dashing  about.  Stars  were  flitting  from  shop  to  beauty  parlor.  Everyone  was  in  a  bustle  and  flurry  of  excitement,  getting  ready.   And  the  star?  The  one  for  whom  all  this  brilliance  was  intended?  Her  first  opening?  Where  was  she?   Inside  a  studio  sound  stage  she  stood.  Years  and  miles  from  the  outside  world  that  whirled  about  her.   Speaking  lines  that  even  the  thought  of  the  glory  awaiting  her  could  not  rob  of  their  depth  and  beauty.

Griffith's  war  picture,  "Hearts  of  the  World,"  to  lead  the  April,  1918,  issue  with  a  story  about  the  hero,  Bobby  Harron,  April  seemed  above  all  to  be  a  month  for  chronicling  discoveries  of  new  stars.   Connie  Talmadge  was  basking  in  the  sunburst  of  popular  ac-  claim won  by  her  first  work — as  The  Mountain  Girl  in  Griffith's  "Intolerance" — while  Mary  Pickford,  no  less,  had  noticed  a  promising  youngster  in  the  company  which  supported  her  in  "The  Little  Princess,"  and  told  Charlie  Chaplin  about  the  newcomer.  Charlie  de-  cided to  try  her — and  thus  ZaSu  Pitts  moved  several  notches  up  the  ladder  to  fame.   Another  chap  who  drew  an  article  by  his  promising  work  was  one  Richard  Barthelmess.  He  was  twenty-two  then,  and  we  remarked  that  he  was  now  getting  good  juvenile  roles,  after    five  years  of  doing  character  old  men — a  curious  start  for  Dick!  From  the  pictures  we  re-  produced, he  seemed  to  have  done  old  men  well,  too.   The  business  of  inducing  more  and  better  emoting  by  having  appropriate  music  played  during  the  shooting,  received  consider-  able attention,  with  revelations  of  what  tunes  made  the  various  great  ones  cry  to  best  advantage.  Mae  Murray's  tears  flowed  best,  we  said,  when  she  heard  Irving  Berlin's  "When  I  Lost  You,"  while  Mary  Pickfo  d  could  let  herself  in  for  a  good  weep  by  having  the  musicians  do  Cad-  man's  "Land  of  the  Sky  Blue  Water."  And  speaking  of  Mary,  we  chronicled  her  "Stella  Maris"  as  her  first  real  acting  vehicle.   Theda  Bara  still  was  the  reigning  vamp,  as  indicated  by  a  full-page  picture,  and  we  showed  cut-outs  of  Buster  Keaton  and  Fatty  Ar-  buckle  working  up  slapstick  gags.  The  cover  sported  a  portrait  cf  Elsie  Ferguson.    Richard  Barthelmess    10  Years  Ago    Y\  THAT  a  fluid,  fast-shifting  W  scene  this  picture  world  is  — with  only  here  and  there  some  enduring  favorite  to  hold  things  together!  Among  these  men-  tioned in  our  issue  of  April,  192.*,  who  figured  five  years  before  that,  five  years  after,  and  who  still  are  with  us,  are  Mary  Pick-  ford,  Doug  Fairbanks,  the  Barry-  mores,  Mae  Marsh  and  Harold  Lloyd.  Ten  years  ago  this  month  we  chronicled  Harold's  marriage  to  Mildred  Davis.  Mary  was  vacillating  between  "Dorothy  Vernon"  and  "Faust"  for  her  next,  and  the  others  were  "'tween  pictures."  Oh,  yes — we  mustn't  forget  Charlie  Chaplin!  We  reviewed  "The  Pilgrim"  that  month,  and  noted  his  engagement  to  Pola  Negri.  Likewise  the  fact  that  these  two,  the  Fairbankses,  and  others  were  planning  an  independent  company  to  escape  so-called  poor  pictures  provided  by  producers.  Valentino  was  still  on  strike  for  that  reason,  and  writing  his  life  story  for  us.    Ramon  Novarro    Richard  Barthelmess,  noted  in  1918  as  a  promising  juvenile,  had  just  done  "Fury,"  a  sea-going  tale,  and  we  said  his  work  marked  him  as  "one  of  the  few  con-  scientious stars  of  our  screen."  Incidentally,  likeness  of  figure  enabled  him,  in  "The  Bright  Shawl,"  to  use  the  stage  cos-  tumes worn  by  John  Barrymore  in  "Peter  Ibbetson. "   Among  newcomers  the  great  shining  light  was  Ramon  Novar-  ro, just  out  with  his  first  smash  hit,  "Where  the  Pavement  Ends."  Jobyna  Ralston  had  been  named  Charlie  Chaplin's  new  leading  lady.  Reports  from  Paris  had  it  that  Doug  Jr.'s  mother,  Mrs.  James  Evans,  was  to  finance  his  entry  into  stardom,  while  Pola  Negri  and  Gloria  Swanson  were  finishing  "Bella  Donna"  and  "Prodigal  Daughters,"  the  respective  vehicles  with  which  they  expected  to  settle  which  one  was  to  be  queen  prima  donna.  Barbara  La  Marr  on  the  cover.    5  Years  Ago    TN  April,  1928,  the  line-up  be-  -*-gins  to  seem  quite  present-day,  for  all  that  the  great  "talkies"  earthquake,  with  its  wholesale  quenching  of  starlight,  was  only  a  few  months  away.  Admirers  of  "Smilin'  Through"  and  "Strange  Interlude"  will  be  amused  to  read  that  Norma  Shearer  said  she  would  play  one  year  after  she  and  Irving  Thal-  berg  returned  from  their  belated  Greta   honeymoon,    then    curtains    for  Garbo   her!  Clara  Bow  finished  her  sprightly  "life  story"  for  us,  and  took  occasion  to  explain  the  whys  and  where-  fores of  her  successive  engagements  to  Gilbert  Roland,  Victor  Fleming  and  Gary  Cooper.  Gary  was  new  then,  and  worked  with  her  in  "Children  of  Divorce."  She  helped  him  and  liked  him — but  he  was  jealous,  as  Clara  saw  it.  But  ah — enter  a  Star  of  Stars!  Greta  Garbo  (yes,  the  "Greta"  was  right  then)  had  been  setting  the  land  adither  with  her  scintillant  screen  charm — so   we   persuaded   her   to   tell    her  life  story,  starting  with  this  issue.  She  related  her  start —  breaking  into  the  Dramatic  School  of  the  Royal  Theater  of  Stockholm;  and  probably  Garbo  admirers  would  murder  us  for  the  picture  we  printed,  showing  her  landing,  sans  glamour,  for  her  American  debut.   Speaking  of  Garbo — five  years  ago  we  tried  finding  out  which  of  our  stars  came  nearest  match-  ing the  Greek  gods  in  physical  perfection.     Who   won?      Well,  Richard  Arlen  came  closest   to  matching    Apollo,    and    Joan    Crawford    was  practically  a  duplicate  of  Venus.     Also,  com-  bined measurements  of  the  leaders  were  al-  most identical  with  those  of  the  ancients —  which  may  or  may  not  prove  anything.   Speaking  of  Joan,  heroine  of  "Rain" — it  was  five  years  ago  this  month  that  we  re-  viewed the  silent  version,  with  Gloria  Swan-  son  and  Lionel  Barrymore.  They  called  it  "Sadie  Thompson."  The  cover?  Esther  Ralston.

Gray  Hair   Best  Remedy  is  Made  At  Home   To  half  pint  of  water  add  one  ounce  bay  rum,  a  small  box  of  Barbo  Compound  and  one-fourth  ounce  of  glycerine.  Any  druggist  can  put  this  up  or  you  can  mix  it  at  home  at  very  little  cost.  Apply  to  the  hair  twice  a  week  until  the  desired  shade  is  obtained.  It  imparts  color  to  streaked,  faded  or  gray  hair  and  makes  it  soft  and  glossy.  Barbo  will  not  color  the  scalp,  is  not  sticky  or  greasy  and  does  not  rub  off.

A  NENT  the  current  fad  in  Hollywood —  the  wearing  of  men's  clothes  by  women —  Richard  Dix  says:   "By  the  time  my  infant  daughter  is  old  enough  to  care  there  will  be  a  double  threat  to  childhood  in  dad's  razor  strop  and  mother's  belt."   \J7ALLY  BEERY  came  on  the  M-G-M  lot  with  a  boiled  lobster  complexion.

Then  we  recalled  that  he  had  been  snow-  bound in  his  June  Lake  cabin,  up  in  the  High  Sierras  for  two  weeks.   We  don't  blame  Wally  for  risking  his  neck  flying  up  there  every  chance  he  gets.   /"\NE  of  the  strangest  friendships  ^^in  Hollywood  is  that  of  Glenda  Farrell,  who  portrays  those  shady  dames  so  beautifully,  and  Mary  Brian,  who  is  always  sweetness  and  light.

To  date  the  membership  includes  Fredric  March,  Karloff, Lionel  Atwill, Preston  S.  Foster,  Edwin  Maxwell,  Bela  Lugosi  and  others.

Consequently  it  calls  for  a  whole  town  covered  in  snow  as  a  set.   Mervyn  and  a  lot  of  the  executives  were  looking  at  the  first  rushes  from  this  set.   "It's  very  realistic,  Mervyn,"  one  of  the  execs  said,  "but  you've  forgotten  one  thing.  You  can't  see  the  actors'  breaths  when  they  talk."   "I  thought  of  that,"  LeRoy  replied,  "and  had  it  all  doped  out.

"   JOHN  MIL  JAN,  that  extra  special  villain  of  •'practically  every  M-G-M  movie,  is  through.  Not  with  movies,  but  with  being  a  villain.  Exactly  ten  years  ago,  John  began  his  deviltry  in  pictures,  and  is  heartily  tired  of  it.  In  all  those  years  of  almost  constant  work,  he  has  had  but  two  opportunities  to  step  out  of  the  villain  class.  One  was  the  husband  of  Ruth  Chatterton  in  one  of  her  films  and  the  other  was  in  "Hell  Divers."  In  each  film,  John's  performance  was  outstanding.    They  call  it  "The  California  Trail."  One  of  those  grand  scenery,  great  horsemanship,  thrill  pictures.  With  a  brave  cowboy,  Buck  Jones,  and  a  sweet  woman,  Helen  Mack,  who  arouses  his  chivalrous  instincts.

Not  for  me,   mother-    not  for  me!    boy:  Mother,  I  bet  you  don't  know  it —  but  you  and  daddy  are  a  little  bit  old-  fashioned.   mother  :  Old-fashioned!   boy:  Just  a  little  bit.  Because  you  clean  your  teeth  plenty — but  I'll  bet  you  never  heard  of  massaging  your  gums.  mother:  I've  noticed  that  ever  since  you  came  home  with  a  tube  of  Ipana — you've  kept  your  teeth  clean  of  your  own  accord.   boy:  And  what's  more,  I  massage  Ipana  into  my  gums,  too.  Know  why?  Because  nowadays  the  food  we  eat  is  pretty  soft,  and  the  blood  just  goes  slower  and  slower  through  your  gums.  And  then  your  gums  start  to  bleed  a  little  and  that's  "pink  tooth  brush."   mother  :  Now  you  remind  me  of  it,  Doc-  tor Newell  told  me  months  ago  that  if  I  didn't  give  my  gums  more  care,  I'd  find  my  teeth  looking  dull.   boy:  Do  you  know  what,  mother?  If  you  keepon  having  "pink  tooth  brush,"  you'll  very  likely  have  Vincent's  dis-  ease— or  g-i-n-g-i-v-i-t-i-s.  We  learned  at  camp  that  "pink  tooth  brush"  is  dang'rous  to  your  teeth.  You  better  massage  your  gums  with  Ipana,  the  way  I  do!  You  just  clean  your  teeth  with  Ipana.  And  then  you  squeeze  out  a  little  bit  more  on  your  tooth  brush  and  rub  it  into  your  gums.   mother:  I  remember  now.  Doctor  New-  ell told  me  about  that.  I'll  start  today  with  Ipana.  And  we'll  surprise  daddy  with  our  perfectly  dazzling  teeth!    DON'T     TAKE     CHANCES!   A  good  dentist  and  a  good  dentifrice  are  not  costly.

Copyright,  1933,  by  the  Photoplay  Publishing  Company,  Chicago    2    Ike  Audi    lence    ialks  Back    THE  $25  LETTER   In  this  disheartening  and  discouraging  period  of  uncertainty,  what  a  genuine  blessing  the  "talkies"  really  are.  How  many,  many  times  you  hear  someone  say,  "If  I  couldn't  go  to  a  show  once  in  a  while,  and  forget  all  my  troubles  and  worries  for  a  couple  of  hours,  I  don't  know  what  I'd  do."   Whether  the  actors  and  producers  of  motion  pictures  are  aware  of  it  or  not,  they,  along  with  a  few  radio  artists,  are  affording  about  the  only  worthwhile  means  of  "mental  relief"  to  the  masses  of  humanity  from  this  monster  evil,  "the  depression."   In  our  own  experience,  my  wife  and  I  have  found  comfort  and  relaxation  from  the  worries  and  forebodings  that  are  constantly  confront-  ing us  at  the  present  time,  through  visits  to  our  local  picture  show.  Time  and  again  we  have  come  away  feeling' that  no  matter  what  may  be  ahead,  no  one  can  rob  us  of  the  memories  of  happy  hours  thus  spent.   Three  rousing  cheers  for  good  old  Hollywood  and  for  all  those  in  any  way  connected  with  the  production  of  motion  pictures.   Charles  S.  Wilton,  Toronto,  Canada   THE  $10  LETTER   One  blizzardy  Sunday  evening  on  our  way  to  church,  our  car  stalled  on  the  pavement  be-  fore the  theater.  The  repair  would  take  some  time,  so  my  husband  and  I  suggested  passing  the  time  by  seeing  the  picture.   My  aunt,  a  very  devout  Christian,  stren-  uously objected,  claiming  it  would  be  the  blackest  of  sins  to  substitute  a  cinema  for  a  sermon.  Somehow  or  other,  after  lengthy  arguments,  we  managed  to  get  her  into  the  theater  to  see  "Smilin'  Through."   As  we  were  leaving  the  theater  she  remarked,  "No  Doctor  of  Divinity,  living  or  dead,  could  ever  preach  a  sermon  that  would  leave  me  as  spiritually  impressed  as  this  picture.  The  world  seems  to  have  taken  a  great  leap  for  the  better,  and  I'm  a  bit  out  of  step."  Mrs.  R.  J.  Garwood,  Minneapolis,  Minn.   THE  $5  LETTER   After  a  hard  day  planning  and  cooking  for  boarders  my  life  indeed  would  seem  pretty  dis-  couraging were  it  not  for  the  recreation  and  rest  I  find  in  a  movie  theater.   Especially  when  it  is  my  privilege  to  witness  a  picture  like  "Cavalcade."  I  left  the  theater  feeling  that  I,  too,  could  carry  on  with  courage,  faith  and  peace.   We  know  our  country  will  come  back,  and  through  these  trying  times  good  pictures  are  a  blessing.    Give  us  more  like  "Cavalcade."   Mrs.  J.  F.  Baker,  Santa  Barbara,  Calif.   "CAVALCADE"— A  WOW   Once  more,  Hollywood  has  turned  out  a  mighty  achievement  .  .  .  "Cavalcade."   A  panorama  of  human  emotions  threading,  sweeping  their  way  through  three  generations,  fate  taking  its  inexorable  course  .  .  .  bringing  about  change  .  .  .  sacrifice;  a  veritable  march  of  time  is  this  stupendous  film.   There  have  been  other  pictures  with  his-  torical backgrounds,  but  none  like  this!  Every  detail  has  been  carried  out  with  an  authenticity  and  a  sincerity  that  is  amazing.  The  acting  is  superb,  especially  that  of  Diana  Wynyard.   Every  man,  woman  and  child  should  see  "Cavalcade."   Ida  Kaech,  New  Glarus,  Wis.   6    While  the  flood  of  "Cavalcade"  letters  notes  the  splendid  work  of  all  in  the  cast,  the  deepest  appeal  was  made  by  Diana  Wyn-  yard, the  mother.  Do  you  won-  der, when  you  see  her  challeng-  ing fate  and  war,  as  it  were,  on  behalf    of   her    two    fine    boys?    WHAT  a  kaleidoscope  these  let-  ters provide — and  what  a  pic-  ture of  moviedom!  New  favored  pictures  coming  into  notice — wit-  ness the  letters  praising  "Cavalcade"  and  "A  Farewell  to  Arms,"  now  at  flood  tide,  the  onset  of  letters  about  "Topaze,"  "State  Fair,"  and  "The  Animal  Kingdom!"   Older  ones  still  pulling  strong —  as  "Smilin'  Through"  and  "Strange  Interlude."  Interest  in  the  latter  shifted,  oddly  enough,  from  the  rapid  aging  of  Norma  and  Clark,  to  discussion  of  the  "spoken  thought."   Among  players,  Ruth  Chatterton  drew  a  spurt  of  interest  with  "Frisco  Jenny,"  while  Katharine  Hepburn's  following  mounts  daily.,   PHOTOPLAY'S  inquiry  about  dominating  male  stars  caused  many  comparisons;  and — last  comment  of  all — the  movies  unquestionably  are  doing  a  magnificent  job  of  buoying  hope,  relieving  strain  and  impart-  ing courage  in  these  troubled  days.    When  the  audience  speaks  the  stars  and  producers  listen.  We  offer  three  prizes  for  the  best  letters  of  the  month — $25,  $10  and  $5.  Literary  ability  doesn't  count.  But  candid  opinions  and  constructive  sugges-  tions do.  We  must  reserve  the  right  to  cut  letters  to  fit  space  limitations.  Address  The  Editor,  PHOTOPLAY,  221  W.  57th  St.,  New  York  City.    DIANA  AND  CLIVE   My  thrilling  enthusiasm  for  the  most  per-  fectly spoken  English  on  the  American  screen  forces  me  to  an  anxious  confession.  "Caval-  cade" was  superb!   Not  only  is  Diana  Wynyard  beautiful,  but  the  dignity  of  her  poise,  her  gracious  charm  and  the  silvery  sweetness  of  her  voice  are  assets  that  our  American  actresses  would  do  well  to  observe.  Clive  Brook  is  as  inestimable  as  ever.  In  fact,  every  actor  was  sublimely  distinctive  down  to  the  most  minor  part.   And  what  a  vivid  lesson  the  story  portrayed,  the  greatest  lesson  the  people  of  all  time  need  to  learn  and  understand — the  outrageous  futility  of  war!   Francois  Ober,  Newton  Centre,  Mass.   IT  SHOULD  HAVE  BEEN  JOHN   "Cavalcade"  was  a  rare  treat.  Diana  Wyn-  yard is  delightful.  She  has  something  to  learn  from  the  American  stars  in  letting  herself  go,  and,  in  heroic  moments,  she  does  not  quite  reach  the  courage  that  is  popular  over  here;  but  I  predict  she  will  learn  rapidly.  The  com-  bination put  Clive  Brook  right  back  where  he  started  from.  I  should  prefer  to  keep  him  American  and  pair  her  up  with  John  Barry-  more.   Katharine  A.  Dunlap,  San  Diego,  Calif.    THOSE    'DOMINATING"  MALE  STARS    "Which  Movie  Star  Dominates  You?"  asks  Hilary  Lynn  in  the  March  Photoplay.  I  am  gladly  submitting  mine,  perhaps  in  a  "jigsaw"  manner:   He  has  made  a  regular  "Dr.  Jekyll  and  Mr.  Hyde"  out  of  me.  "  My  Sin"  is  in  adoring  this  idol  of  the  movies;  but,  my  goodness,  we  are  "Only  Strangers  in  Love,"  so  I  cannot  say  "Merrily  We  Go  To  Hell"  for  "Tonight  Is  Ours"!  I  must  think  of  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross"  and  be  guided  accordingly.   Now,  Mr.  Editor,  do  you  know?   Helene  Williams,  Hartford,  Conn.   SHE  LIKES  'EM  BOTH   In  regard  to  your  recent  article  "Which  Movie  Star  Dominates  You?"  I  came  to  the  conclusion  of  a  combination  of  Mr.  Gable  and  Mr.  Menjou.  The  simple  reason — it  is  natural  for  a  true  woman  to  be  dominated  by  man.  Of  course,  with  its  limits.   Bertha  Eisemann,  Chicago,  111.   "TOPAZE"  SPELLS  MORE   I  saw  "Topaze"  last  night  and  experienced  a  great  unexpected  pleasure.  I  had  heard  many  criticisms  pro  and  con,  and  was  naturally  very  anxious  to  gather  my  own  impressions.  Evi-  dently many  who  saw  the  picture  missed  most  cf  the  subtlety;  but  those  who  appreciate  it,  will  enjoy  an  entirely  new  type  of  screen  humor.

Need  we  name  Janet  Gaynor  and  Lew  Ayres?    What  do  you  think?    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  6  ]   "Topaze"  is  a  picture  entirely  devoid  of  all  the  fol-de-rol  of  ordinary  pictures.  In  it  John  Barrymore  gives  a  classic  performance;  the  most  worthy  achievement  of  his  career.   If  you  are  able  to  appreciate  satire  in  its  most  subtle  form,  wit  in  its  liner  shades,  delicate  pantomime  and  superb  acting,  you  cannot  help  but  enjoy  "Topaze."  It  is  a  challenge  to  one's  good  taste  and  appreciation  for  genuinely  fine  accomplishment.  May  we  have  more  pictures  like  it.   Mrs.  K.  O'Toole,  Dallas,  Tex.   ATTENTION,  JOHN!   It  seems  fitting  at  this  time  to  offer  fresh  tribute  to  that  ever  interesting  artist,  John  Barrymore.  But  surely  he  has  no  need  of  my  praise.  Barrymore  did  a  splendid  piece  of  acting  in  his  latest  film  "Topaze."  His  por-  trayal of  the  foolish  old  professor  was  truly  delightful  and  remarkable  for  the  apparent  ease  with  which  it  was  executed.   Permit  me  to  salute  John  Barrymore!  Naomi  Wheldon,  Detroit,  Mich.   BUT,  WHY?   Depression  up  to  our  necks  and  not  one  movie  i>f  it!  Do  the  producers  think  we  have  too  much  of  it  in  real  life  and  are  marking  time  until  the  clouds  lift  and  we  can  then  be  able  to  laugh  at  ourselves  and  the  problems  we  faced  "back  in  the  depression  period"?   Let's  see  Clark  Gable  and  Fredric  March  in  the  breadline,  doing  a  little  "buddy  can  you  spare  a  dime?"  stuff;  let's  see  how  Joan  would  react  to  getting  "laid  off  indefinitely,"  and  Norma  reduced  to  only  one  maid.  Even  the  great  Garbo  suffering  from  other  pangs  than  those  of  love.   Yes,  someone  please  show  us  how  the  movie  great  would  look  going  through  the  depression.   Rosemary  Newton,  Minneapolis,  Minn.    GOOD  WORK,  LEW  AND  WILL!   Last  night  I  saw  "State  Fair."  Will  Rogers  and  Louise  Dresser  were  well  teamed  I  thought,  but  I  especially  watched  Janet  and  Lew.   I  am  a  great  devotee  of  the  Gaynor-Farrell  team,  but  I  believe  I  enjoyed  Janet  and  Lew    a  trifle  better.  He's  so  tough  and  non-  chalant and  she's  so  tiny  and  sweet.

"STATE   FAIR"    GIVES   HIM    FAITH   When  the  Governor  of  Michigan  declared  an  eight  day  bank  holiday,  my  first  reaction  was  to  run  away,  everything  seemed  so  hope-  less.   I  decided  to  give  myself  one  last  fling  and  went  to  see  "State  Fair."  I  came  out  of  the  theater  buoyed  up  with  the  feeling  that  things  are  not  always  as  bad  as  they  seem.  It  gave  me  a  new  slant  on  life.   I  still  don't  know  where  my  next  dollar  is  coming  from,  but  I  again  have  faith  in  the  future.   John  Dooley,  Detroit,  Mich.   PAGING  RUTH  ROLAND   Such  a  charming  woman  as  Ruth  Roland,  whom  we  admired  of  old  in  those  thrilling  serials,  should  be  given  a  chance  in  these  days  of  near  technical  perfection  in  the  motion  picture  industry.   We've  always  admired  Ruth  and  hope  to  see  her  again  in  a  serial  real  soon.   Pansy  Brady,  Baton  Rouge,  La.   What  in  the  world  has  happened  to  serial  pictures  and  Ruth  Roland  who  used  to  play  those  thrilling  leads  to  perfection?   There  are  thousands  of  us  who  miss  these  real  honest-to-goodness  serials  and  the  charm-  ing Miss  Roland  from  our  screens  today,  and  we  are  wondering  if  there  is  not  something  that  can  be  done  to  bring  them  back  to  us.  Ruth  E.  Keast,  Chicago,  111.   Rumors  have  been  going  around  that  Ruth   Roland  may  return  to  the  movies  in  serials.   Her  serials  were  always  so  wholesome  and    Readers  keep  asking,  "Where's  Ruth  Roland,  and  what  about  more  serials?"  That  we  can't  say — but  we  did  catch  her  (at  right)  recently,  as  you  see,  going  to  a  Mayfair  party  with  Ben  Bard  and  Mae  Murray    Final  Verdict  on  Plays  and  Players    clean,  and  with  the  modern  equipment  I  am  sure  Miss  Roland  would  not  disappoint  her  producers    or    audiences.   Jack  W.  Oldham,  Hartford,  Conn.   It  is  a  matter  of  keen  regret  to  the  Ruth  Roland  club  that  we  have  not  seen  her  in  a  serial  picture   recently.   Our  club  has  a  membership  of  five  hundred.  We  are  all  interested  in  Miss  Roland's  success  and,  of  course,  support  the  theaters  showing  her  pictures.   Won't  the  producers  give  consideration  to  the  idea  of  making  a  serial  featuring  her.   Mary  Cushing,  Chicago,  111.   THAT  DEATHLESS  SCENE  IN  "A  FAREWELL  TO  ARMS"   Helen  Hayes'  portrayal  of  death  and  Gary  as  he  knelt  by  her  bedside  and  gave  to  her  of  his  splendid  courage  and  strength,  to  carry  her  across  that  mysterious  borderland,  was  so  excruciatingly  real  and  vivid  that  I  lived  all  over  again  those  aching  hours  of  sadness  when  I,  too,  knelt  at  the  bedside  of  a  dear  one  and  tried  to  give  courage  and  strength  to  him  as  he  slipped  from  my  keeping.   Truly  it  must  take  really  great  actors  to  live   their   roles   as   Helen   Hayes   and    Gary  Cooper  did  in  "A  Farewell  to  Arms."    With  all  my  heart  I  say,  "bravo"  to  you  both!  Corrine  Wilhete,  Kansas  City,  Kan.    THE    'ETHEREAL"  HELEN  AND  THE  'INCOMPARARLE"  GARY    Ah,  John !  We  always  expect  outstanding  work  from  any  Barrymor.e ;  but  that  whimsical,  pathetic  and  appealing  schoolmaster  you  did  in  "Topaze" — well,  "incomparable,"  is  the  word  many  letters  employ    I  wouldn't  throw  a  brick  if  I  had  a  carload  at  the  cinema  after  the  production  of  "A  Farewell  to  Arms."   Did  anyone  ever  see  more  superb  acting?  Although  I  do  not  think  Helen  Hayes  is  so  beautiful  off-screen,  she  appears  so  divinely  ethereal  on  celluloid  that  she  leaves  a  breath  of  sweetness  with  one  for  days.   And  Gary  Cooper!    Quick,  stop  me  before    I  start  again!  Suffice  to  say  his  performance  was  incomparable.  Only  one  thing! — That  ending.    Did  Helen  have  to  die?   Lillian  Bock,  Grey  Eagle,  Minn.   BUT  SHE  DIDN'T  LIKE  GARY   I  want  to  tell  you  that  I  thought  the  picture    Whether  folks  like  bad  girls  better,  as  Ruth  Chatterton  said  in  a  recent  PHOTOPLAY  article,  is  hard  to  determine.  But  that  they  did  like  her  bad  in  "Frisco  Jenny"  is  unquestionable.    They're  all  for  her    "A  Farewell  to  Arms"  very  fascinating.  The  splendid  acting  of  Helen  Hayes  and  Adolphe  Menjou  was  worth  my  time  in  seeing  the  picture.     Helen  Hayes  did  a  grand  work.   But  I  should  like  to  criticize  Gary  Cooper  for  his  poor  acting  lately.  Something  is  the  matter  with  Gary.  Perhaps  he  needs  to  fall  in  love !   Alberta  Bostock,  Sapulpa,  Okla.   BETTER  THAN  THE  BOOK   "A  Farewell  to  Arms"  was  the  first  instance,  so  far  as  I  know,  where  the  motion  picture  was  an  improvement  over  the  book.  The  motion  picture  has  made  a  far  more  sensitive  and  beautiful  story  out  of  it  than  the  book — all  except  that  censor-sop,  the  pseudo  wedding.  And  it  was  sensitively  and  beautifully  played,  by  sensitive  actors.   Although  Helen  Hayes  is  one  of  the  most  capable  and  sincere  actresses  on  the  screen,  never  for  one  moment  did  she  overshadow  Gary  Cooper.  Give  him  more  pictures  like  this.   Martha  Brent,  New  York,  N.  Y.   FOLKS  LIKE  "ANIMAL  KINGDOM"   When  does  acting  cease  to  be  just  acting  and  become  the  ultimate  in  sheer  artistry?  When  Leslie  Howard  and  Ann  Harding  give  us  such  a  picture  as  "The  Animal  Kingdom,"  easily  the  most  delightful  screen  offering  in  a  blue  moon  because  of  its  clever  direction,  excellent  cast  and  restrained  interpretation.  Mrs.  W.  P.  Jackson,  Columbia,  Tenn.   Just  saw  "The  Animal  Kingdom"  for  the  third  time.  Ann  Harding  and  Leslie  Howard  are  perfect!  Pictures  like  "The  Animal  Kingdom"  and  stars  like  Ann  Harding  and  Leslie  Howard  are  a  credit  to  the  motion  picture  industry.   Let  her  not  go  "bad"  on  us.

They  comment  on  her  gentility,  her  beautiful    hands  —  particularly    her    well    cared    for    finger    nails !    for  lesser  stars.     We  love  her  just  as  she  is.  Why  change  what  is  already  perfect?   Jean  Rietz,  Chicago,  111.   AT    YOUR    SERVICE,    KACHADOUR!   May  this  exceedingly  humble  Oriental  ex-  press his  worthless  observations  in  the  il-  lumined pages  of  your  valued  publication?   It  has  been  a  mystery  to  my  insignificant  Eastern  mind  why  so  many  pictures  represent  the  despicable  villain  as  a  master-mind  of  ingenuity  and  resourcefulness,  cool  and  clever  in  action,  while  the  honorable  hero  appears  as  a  reckless  fool,  devoid  of  sense,  who  rushes  headlong  into  unnecessary  dangers,  exposes  himself  to  certain  death  and  through  most  childish  manoeuvering  comes  out  victorious  in  the  end.   Do  not  the  distinguished  directors  observe  these   glaring   inconsistencies?   Offering  ten  thousand  times  ten  thousand  apologies  to  the  terrestrial  stars  for  disturbing  the  tranquillity  of  their  virgin  minds,  I  re-  main, an  inconsequential  Oriental,   Kachadour  Arslanian,  Chula  Vista,  Calif.    SAFETY  WITH  K.  HEPBURN   I  believe  the  American  motion  picture  public  admires  refinement.  For  instance,  Katharine  Hepburn.  Notice  her  hands,  especially  her  finger  nails — well  kept,  but  natural.  Look  at  the  long,  sharp  pointed  nails,  highly  colored,  of  other  stars.  They  remind  one  of  the  dangerous  claws  of  an  animal,  and  we  often  fear  for  our  hero's  life.   Away  with  the  claws !   R.  Eggers,  Tulsa,  Okla.   WE  HAVEN'T  EITHER—   Let's  scatter  a  few  well-earned  compliments  among   deserving   newcomers.   The  list  is  headed  by  Hollywood's  newest  red-head,  Katharine  Hepburn.  She  is  posi-  tively the  most  interesting  star  in  all  Holly-  wood.   And  three  rousing  cheers  for  Helen  Vin-  son!   She's  no  Garbo,  and  we've  never  seen  her  legs,  but  we  like  her  anyway.   Daisy  Cross,  Aurora,  111.    INTRIGUING— IF  THE  CENSOR  CONSENTS   Why  not  put  a  real  nightie  on  a  movie  actress  instead  of  the  tightly  belted,  lace  and  satin  affairs  that  now  masquerade  as  nighties  when  the  charming  heroine  hops  in  or  out  of  bed?   An  honest-to-goodness  nightie  can  be  a  mighty  intriguing  thing,  remember,  when  it's  on  the  right  lassie.   Mary  G.  Street,  Oakland,  Calif.   WHAT  THEY  SAW  IN  "FRISCO  JENNY"   In  "Frisco  Jenny,"  Ruth  Chatterton  is  seen  in  her  best  characterization  to  date.  All  who  have  been  through  an  earthquake  will  agree  that  the  scenes  of  the  San  Francisco  disaster  are  terribly  real.   Beryl  Crowell,  New  Orleans,  La.   I  owe  one  of  the  greatest,  if  not  the  greatest,  star  in  Hollywood  an  apology.   Because  I  saw  Ruth  Chatterton  in  one  of  her  first  talkies,  which  was  a  very  poor  story,  I  vowed  I  would  never  see  another  Chatterton  film.   Now  is  my  face  red?  Through  no  fault  of  mine  I  went  to  see  "Frisco  Jenny."  Now  I  realize  that  I  have  been  missing  the  best  Hollywood  has  to  offer.   [Mrs.  Hazel  Neff,  Zanesville,  Ohio   NEW  LIGHT  ON  "STRANGE  INTERLUDE"   I  have  just  witnessed  "Strange  Interlude."  This  picture  is  a  good  object  lesson  for  all  the  world.  Our  lies  and  deceits  are  the  seeds  we  sow  and  we  harvest  accordingly.  And  it  proves  what  cowards  we  are — lacking  courage  to  speak  our  convictions.  This  objective  les-  son proves  the  great  need  of  purifying  our  thoughts,  if  we  expect  to  reach  happiness.  Minnie  Huseby,  Fargo,  N.  Dak.   This  new  racket  of  "thought  recording"  is  all  bosh.  It  is  confusing  to  say  the  least.  As  it  is  contrary  to  the  theme  of  the  story,  it  tends  to  interfere  with  the  unity  of  thought  of  the  audience  and  almost  produces  comedy.  Orlena  M.  Pinkston,  Elk  City,  Kansas   CLINICAL  CONCLUSIONS  ABOUT  KISSING   All  the  world  loves  a  lover,  but  I've  dis-  covered the  torrid  kisses  are  more  popular  with  the  majority.   When  Clark  Gable  flashes  across  the  screen,  sweeping  Jean  Harlow  right  off  her  feet  into  his  arms,  then  the  audience  holds  its  breath,  and  many  a  feminine  heart  misses  a  beat.   But  when  the  sweet  little  ingenue  melts  into  the  arms  of  the  big  strong  hero  with  a  sigh,  there  are  always  quite  a  lot  of  amused  giggles.   I  guess  it's  because  we  all  love  an  experienced  lover.   Dily  Dingle,  Portsmouth,  England   THIS  SLAPPING  BUSINESS   Clark  Gable  and  James  Cagney  slap  their  ladies  but  when  they  made  a  wife-beater  out  of  Conrad  Nagel — well,  I  would  have  been  no  more  shocked  if  Ann  Harding  had  appeared  on  the  screen  smoking  a  pipe,  or  Gloria  Swanson  with  a  big  chew  of  tobacco.

Why  hands  get  rough,  coarse   Housework  means  putting  hands  in  and  out  of  hot   water,  using  harsh  alkali  cleansers.  This  dries  out  the   natural  skin  oils.  Hinds  puts  back  these  precious  oils   . . .  restores  youthful  softness  and   smoothness.   Hinds  is  an  ultra-penetrating  lotion.  Thus  is  absorbed  more  thoroughly.  That  is  why  it  can  do  in  3  days  what  other  creams  may  do  in  weeks.  Hinds  is  not  a  weak,  thinned-out  lotion.  Not  a  thick,  gummy  jelly  that  just  goes  over  the  top  of  the  skin.   Wliat  the  "second  skin,,  is   And  then,  Hinds  leaves  an  in-  visible "second  skin"  that  protects  hands.  This  "second  skin"  is  a  fine  layer  of  Hinds  Cream  that  has    TODAY    t    penetrated  so  deeply  through  the  rough  skin  that  water  won't  wash  it  off.  There  it  stays,  softening,  whitening,  protecting.   Use  Hinds  after  exposure.  After  hands  have  been  in  water,  and  always  at  night.

Looks  as  if  he  knows  just  about  what  to  expect,  too    Cheese  and  Pineapple   To  each  package  of  cream  cheese,  add  one-half  cup  of  cream,  whipped.  Mash  cheese  and  combine  with  cream.  Then  add  an  equal  measure  of  finely  chopped  pineapple,  well  drained.  Spread  half  of  the  slices  with  a  layer  of  cheese  mixture,  and  cover  other  half  with  a  lettuce  leaf,  spread  lightly  with  mayonnaise.  Put  together  and  press  lightly.   Mock  Pate  De  Fois  Gras   Remove  casing  from  a  liver  sausage  and  mash  to  a  paste  with  mayonnaise  in  quantity  to  make  an  even  spread.  This  is  especially  delicious  on  thin,  buttered  rye  bread.   Chicken  and  Nut   Chop  cold  chicken  in  wooden  bowl  until  quite  fine,  and  mix  with  enough  chicken  gravy  to  moisten.  To  each  cup  of  chick-  en, add  one -fourth  cup  of  chopped  nuts,  a  few  drops  of  lemon  juice,  and  celery  salt.  Spread  with  a  little  mayonnaise.   Watercress   A  refreshing  and  delicious  spring  sandwich  is  made  of  plain  watercress,  washed  and  drained  thoroughly,  and  placed  on  thin,  buttered  bread  with  a  little  mayonnaise,  and  a  sprinkle  of  salt.    OH  no,  not  really  mixed  tea.  Rather,  mixed  guests.  And  not  quite  that,  either.  So  many  folks  have  an  idea  that  attendance  at  a  tea  party  is  an  exclusively  feminine  prerogative.  But  that  holds  true  no  longer.  At  the  get-acquainted  tea  party  given  by  Lilian  Harvey  upon  her  arrival  in  Hollywood,  the  men  outnumbered  the  women!  .  So  here's  your  chance  to  pay  off  all  those  social  obligations  with  one  grand  party  and  with  a  minimum  of  expense.  You  can  invite  twice  as  many  guests,  with  a  lesser  expenditure  of  time  and  money  than  most  small  dinner  parties  would  cost.  Of  course,  you  will  arrange  your  tea  for  a  day  when  it  is  most  convenient  for  the  boys  to  join  in  the  fun.   It  is  essential  that  you  serve  a  variety  of  tasty  sandwiches.  And  since  sandwich-making  is  an  art  in  itself,  let  us  consider  first  the  fundamentals.  If  possible,  use  home-made  bread.  Trim  crusts  and  slice  bread  thinly.  Spread  melted  butter  on  slices  with  pastry  brush.  This  is  by  far  the  most  satis-  factory method  when  butter-  ing quantities  of  bread.   Surely  you  will  want  to  try  some  of  the  delicious  sand-  wiches Miss  Harvey  served.    Cucumber  and  Egg    Photoplay  Magazine  919  N.  Michigan  Ave.,  Chicago,  111.   Please  send  me  a  copy  of  Photoplay's  Famous  Cook  Book,  containing  150  favorite  recipes  of  the  stars.  I  am  enclosing  twenty-five  cents.    Be  sure  to  write  name  and  address  plainly.  You  may  send  either  stamps  or  coin.    Pare  cucumbers,  cut  lengthwise  and  remove  seeds.  Chop  finely  and  mix  with  a  little  onion,  add  mayonnaise.  Then  add  four  hard-boiled  eggs,  also  chopped,  and  mix.  Be  sure  to  season  well.  Spread  on  one  slice  of  bread,  placing  lettuce  leaf  on  other.     Press  tightly  together.   And  now  for  that  "right"  way  of  making  tea!  Use  one  level  teaspoon  (or  a  bit  more  if  you  prefer  it  strong)  of  tea  to  every  two  cups  of  boiling  water.      Scald  your  teapot,  which   should  be  of  earthenware  or  china.  Allow  the  hot  water  to  stand  in  pot  long  enough  to  heat  it  through.  Then  pour  it  out,  place  the  tea  inside,  and  add  boiling  water.   Allow  to  draw  about  three  minutes.  Try  a  little  honey  in  place  of  sugar.   When  you  cut  out  lemon  slices  in  fancy  shapes,  stick  a  few  whole  cloves  in  each  slice.   In  addition  there  might  also  be  salted  nuts,  sweet  pickles,  stuffed  celery,  stuffed  olives,  plain  or  with  a  strip  of  broiled  bacon  pinned  around  with  a  toothpick.    10    Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933    l7    Brief  Reviews  of  Current  Pictures   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  14  ]    PENGUIN  POOL  MURDER,  THE— RKO-  Radio. — For  the  laugh-hungry.

Use  Listerine  .  .  .  deodorizes  hours  longer    You  never  can  tell  when  you  have  halitosis  (unpleasant  breath),  the  unforgivable  social  fault.  The  wise  thing  to  do,  then,  is  to  use  Listerine  before  social  engagements.  No  fas-  tidious man  or  woman  would  over-  look this  precaution.   After  using  Listerine,  you  know  that  your  breath  cannot  offend  others.  The  moment  this  amazing  antiseptic  and  deodorant  enters  the  mouth,  it  cleanses,  arrests  fermentation,  de-  cay, and  infection — all  causes  of  odors — then  overcomes  the  odors  themselves.  Listerine  instantly  gets  rid  of  odors  that  ordinary  mouth  washes  cannot  hide  in  12  hours.   Don't  be  one  of  the  thousands  who  take  it  for  granted  that  their  breath    is  beyond  reproach  when,  as  a  mat-  ter of  fact,  it  is  not.  The  unwelcome  truth  is  that  everyone  is  a  victim  of  halitosis  at  some  time  or  another.   You  can  readily  understand  why:  a  few  particles  of  fermenting  food,  overlooked  by  the  tooth  brush,  often  cause  bad  breath.  A  slightly  decay-  ing tooth  or  a  leaky  filling  produces  odors.  Also,  excesses  of  eating  and  drinking,  and,  of  course,  temporary  or  chronic  infections  of  the  mouth,  nose,  and  throat.   So  we  say:  don't  guess  about  the  condition  of  your  breath.  Simply  keep  Listerine  handy  in  home  and  office,  and  rinse  the  mouth  with  it  every  morning  and  night,  and  be-  tween times  before  meeting  others.

For  almost  every  contract  sets  a  limit  to  the  pounds  a  star  can  gain.   That's  why  screen  favorites  know  what  foods  build  energy — give  nour-  ishment— without  adding  a  fraction  to  the  silhouette.   No  heavy  lunches!   At  lunch  time  especially,  you'll  find  few  stars  eating  a  heavy,  fattening  meal.  They  need  energy  to  pull  them  through  the  afternoon.  And  they  get  it  from  a  light,  nourishing  lunch  —  the  famous  "Hollywood  Lunch."  Look  at  the  picture  above.  It  was    snapped  on  location  as  Greta  Nissen  and  Adolphe  Menjou  took  time  out  for  lunch  between  scenes  of  "Circus  Queen  Murder" —  the  new  Columbia  production.

'BcmltxCs  TZichex,  OMatied  Mlh    CO  TO  THE  FOUNTAIN  THAT    DISPLAYS  THE  BORDEN   DIAMOND    Close-Ups  and  Long-Shots    HOLLYWOOD  came  through  the  earthquake  practically     unscathed.       Long    Beach    and  Compton  business  districts,  only  a  score  of  miles  away,  were  virtually  demolished.   But  the  sustained  temblor,  which  wrecked  these  cities,  caused  Hollywood  to  shake  up  on  its  founda-  tions, and  people  rushed  panic-stricken  into  the  streets.  No  one  knew  when  the  buildings,  swaying  like  trees  in  a  gale,  would  fall  upon  them.  Hollywood  was  plenty  scared.   Broadway  stage  folk  who  had  recently  arrived  stood  with  white  faces  and  open  mouths,  terrifiedly  wishing  themselves  back  in  New  York.  And  those  who  had  lived  in  Hollywood  all  their  lives  were  just  as  badly  paralyzed  with  fear.   AT  the  studios  themselves,  although  there  were  no  casualties  nor  any  damage  other  than  demoli-  tion of  a  few  sets,  all  was  chaos  while  the  shocks  lasted.  Casts  rushed  from  the  stages  into  the  open.  Execu-  tives, directors,  authors  and  stenographers  stood  for  a  moment  trembling  with  fear  as  they  realized  what  was  happening,  and  then  deserted  the  studio  buildings  pell-mell.  Laboratory  workers  left  their  film  in  the  "soup"  and  dived  for  safety.  Actors  ran  from  dress-  ing-rooms, half  clad.   It  is  safe  to  say  that  in  that  one  moment  more  prayers  were  breathed  than  Hollywood  has  heard  for  years.   PERHAPS  the  most  dramatic  thing  that  happened  during  the  entire  shock  was  on  the  "Dead  On  Arrival"  set,  at  Paramount,  where  Ricardo  Cortez  was  performing  an  operation  on  Gloria  Stuart.  First  the  operating  table  rolled  away  and  Gloria  sat  up.  The  cameraman,  leaving  his  electrically-driven  camera  still  running,  rushed  to  the  doors.  But  the  whole  cast  was  trapped  on  the  huge  sound  proof  stage.  And  as  the  building  swayed,  the  lights  trembled  and  the  dazed  crew  stopped,  virtually  paralyzed,  the  still  grinding  camera  photographed  the  entire  terror-  stricken  scene  until  the  current  was  cut  off.  The  players  finally  forced  the  doors  and  rushed  into  the  street.   On  another  sound  stage  a  few  yards  away  Carole  Lombard,  Alan  Dinehart  and  the  rest  of  the  "Super-  natural" cast  were  making  a  spooky  scene  with  the    whole  set  dimly  lighted  and  with  weird  sound  effects.  At  first  everybody  thought  the  quake  was  a  part  of  the  picture,  but  when  the  realization    hit  them  the  panic  was  on.   INDIVIDUAL  stars  felt  the  upheaval  wherever  they  were.  Claudette  Colbert  was  walking  in  the  studio  wardrobe  when  the  floor  started  to  shimmy  and  a  dummy  rolled  out  of  the  shadows  right  to  her  feet  in  the  darkness.  Claudette  gave  one  wild  whoop  and  was  on  her  way.   Irene  Dunne  was  in  a  dentist's  chair.  She,  the  nurse  and  the  dentist  all  made  a  rush  for  the  door.  The  door  was  jammed  and  had  to  be  taken  off  its  hinges  before  they  could  get  out,  with  the  building  rocking  like  a  ship  in  a  wild  sea.   Libyan  Tashman  was  having  her  hair  waved.  She  was  in  bed  all  the  next  day  as  a  result  of  the  shake.  Even  now  she's  thanking  her  stars  that  she  wasn't  getting  a  permanent,  or  she  might  have  been  electro-  cuted.   Buster  Crabbe,  making  a  personal  appearance  at  a  Los  Angeles  theater,  had  just  bought  himself  a  new  pair  of  shoes  and  was  re-entering  the  theater  to  go  on.  As  the  ground  beneath  him  began  to  shake  he  said  to  the  doorman,  "  Guess  I'll  go  and  put  my  old  shoes  back  on.     There's  something  wrong  with  these  new  ones."   Jack  Oakie,  sitting  in  the  legal  department  arguing  about  signing  for  the  fifty  per  cent  cut,  felt  the  temblor,  seized  a  pen,  and  signed  immediately.    CLARK  GABLE  was  in  the  publicity  office.  When  the  lights  went  out  Clark  made  for  the  door.  His  foot  went  into  a  waste  basket  and  he  went  flying  into  the  street,  waste  basket  and  all.   Marian  Nixon  was  in  her  fourth  floor  apartment  when  all  the  china  fell  out  of  the  cupboards.  Gather-  ing up  two  broken  dishes,  she  ran  to  the  street  below,  leaving  all  her  jewelry  behind  her  in  a  drawer.   Robert  Montgomery  and  Director  Harry  Beaumont  made  for  the  door  of  their  stage  at  the  same  time.  Each  insisted  that  the  other  go  out  first  and  they  soon  found  themselves  wrestling  to  push  the  other  to  safety.  Neither  got  out  before  the  shocks  were  over.   Joan  Crawford  was  reading  in  her  living  room.  She  ran  outside  and  sat  by  the  front  door  all  night.  Nothing  could  persuade  her  to  go  either  in  or  out.   £5    Don  Cook  and  Jack  Holt,  heroes  of  Columbia's  "Tampico,"  were  in  an  executive's  office.  Both  heroes  made  a  dash  for  the  door.   "Yaw,"  yelled  the  executive,  "you  can't  take  it."   But  when  they  got  to  the  street  they  found  him  there  already.   Noah  Beery  ran  out  of  the  studio  in  his  ghastly  make-up  of  a  horror  picture.  The  people  thronging  the  street  went  into  hysterics  as  they  saw  him.    ELISSA  LAND  I  is  wondering  whether  she  gets  seven  years'  bad  luck  as  a  result  of  the  quake.  She  was  brushing  her  hair  in  her  dressing-room  when  she  fell  against  the  mirror  and  smashed  it  with  the  brush.   Louise  Closser  Hale  thought  it  was  her  glasses  that  made  the  room  shake  so  and  decided  to  consult  her  oculist,  then  she  learned  there  had  been  a  quake.   Tom  Brown  had  just  stepped  into  the  bath  tub.  The  tub  tilted  and  nearly  drowned  him.  He  jumped  out  and  then,  realizing  that  he  was  naked,  got  back  in  again.   Maurice  Chevalier,  recording  a  song  standing  beside  a  pool  for  a  romantic  scene,  was  astounded  when  the  water  slopped  out  and  the  gold  fish  jumped  out  of  the  pool  and  hit  him.   Marlene  Dietrich  was  autographing  a  photograph  to  Travis  Banton,  designer,  and  had  just  begun  the  "M"  when  the  quake  jittered  the  pen  all  over  the  picture.  She  dated  it  as  the  only  "earthquake  auto-  graph" in  existence.   Miriam  Hopkins  was  taking  off  her  make-up  in  her  dressing-room.  She  ran  to  the  door  and  right  then  the  door  came  violently  open  and  hit  her.  All  she  could  think  of  to  yell  was:  "Billy  (her  hairdresser)  I  want  my  hair  fixed."    ADRIENNE  AMES  thought  the  studio  was  being  shaken  by  a  heavy  truck  until  she  looked  out  of  her  second  floor  window  and  saw  the  huge,  three  hundred  foot  high  water  tower  swaying  like  a  pen-  dulum. The  sound  of  the  water  swishing  around  was  terrific.   And  then  Adrienne  streaked  down  to  the  open  spaces.    She  was  the  last  one  out  of  the  building.   Brian  Aherne,  playing  with  Dietrich  in  "Song  of  Songs,"  had  just  finished  for  the  day  and  was  taking  a  shower.  He  made  the  street  in  one  jump  and  a  bath  towel,  wishing  he  had  never  left  old  Broadway.    HOLLYWOOD  was  almost  as  aghast  over  the  banking  holiday  as  it  was  over  the  earthquake.  Perhaps  the  impression  was  even  deeper.  The  effect  was  similar  to  that  in  Wall  Street  upon  the  bursting  of  the  great  financial  bubble  in  October,  1929.  The  de-  pression was  over  three  years  in  reaching  Hollywood.  Having  gone  through  the  experience  a  year  ago  of  having   some   of  the  banks   close  permanently,  the   26    "holiday"  created  something  of  a  near-panic.  Caught  unprepared,  like  the  vast  majority  of  people  through-  out the  nation,  the  actors  were  inclined  to  look  upon  their  deposits  as  an  irretrievable  loss.  Perhaps  it  was  because  of  the  distance  of  Hollywood  from  the  big-  financial  centers  that  made  them  think  that  their  banks  would  not  reopen.   High  paid  stars  found  themselves  almost  penniless.  Maurice  Chevalier  had  to  borrow  two  dollars  from  a  worker  in  a  filling  station.  Noah  Beery  had  forty-five  cents.  While  Roland  Young  had  exactly  twenty-  three  cents  in  his  pocket.   Some  of  the  studios  managed  to  get  money  from  somewhere  to  cash  in  part  pay-checks.  At  M-G-M  an  armored  car  under  convoy  of  motorcycle  cops  and  special  police  dashed  through  the  gates,  the  siren  shrieking.  From  the  excitement  created,  you  would  have  thought  it  was  a  return  to  frontier  days,  with  a  stage  coach  arriving  after  a  dash  through  the  hostile  Indian  country.    THE  practical  cessation  of  payment  of  the  studio's  one  million  three  hundred  thousand  dollar  a  week  pay-roll  brought  the  long  discussed  subject  of  the  cut  in  salaries  to  a  crisis.  A  fifty  per  cent  reduction  has  been  voted  and  accepted.  Whether  the  full  resump-  tion of  banking  activities  will  modify  the  length  of  this  period  remains  to  be  seen.   The  upward  swing  in  business  that  the  entire  nation  now  looks  hopefully  forward  to  will  naturally  remove  the  financial  strain  upon  the  motion  picture  industry.  Motion  pictures  are  the  one  great  amusement,  and  amusement  is  vital  to  a  nation's  happiness.  So  for  that  reason  the  production  of  pictures  is,  in  reality,  a  basic  industry   J  VARIETY  records  the  striking  relation  of  motion  V  picture  houses  to  business.  It  cites,  for  example,  how  the  closing  of  a  big  picture  theater  in  Minnesota  has  reduced  store  rentals  from  three  hundred  and  four  hundred  dollars  a  month  to  one  hundred  and  one  hundred  fifty  dollars.   There  is  an  old  saying  that  trade  follows  a  nation's  flag.  Evidently  business  keeps  step  with  the  crowd,  too.    SEVERAL  years  ago,  John  Ford  directed  a  picture  for  Fox,  which  reached  the  screen  as  "Four  Sons."  I.  A.  R.  Wylie  had  written  the  original.  Margaret  Mann  was  unforgettable  in  the  featured  role — that  of  the  mother.  Today,  John  Ford  is  directing  a  picture  for  Fox,  which  may  reach  the  screen  as  "Pilgrimage."  This  also  by  I.  A.  R.  Wylie.   Margaret  Mann  has  a  bit  part,  calling  for  a  few  scenes.  She  skyrocketed  to  fame  in  that  one  picture,  "Four  Sons,"  yet  she  never  could  find  another  role  to  approach  it.

CAMAY    THE      SOAP      OF      BEAUTIFUL      WOMEN    Clara's  European    "This  is  what  they  call  a  luge  up  here.    Rex  and  I  had  our  first  run  on  it  today.    Thrilling  fun"    WHEN  Photoplay  first  asked  me  to  sit  down  and  write  about  my  trip  to  Europe,  I  said  "Sure!"  I  was  so  full  of  every-  thing I'd  seen,  I  could  have  gone  on  talking  forever.  But  there  was  too  much  to  say.  It  would  have  made  a  book,  and  I  haven't  time  to  write  one  now,  although  some  day  I  intend  to.   That's  why  I  tried  to  keep  a  diary  in  Europe,  just  marking  down  the  things  that  meant  most  to  me.  Of  course,  it  isn't  written  like  literature  which  I'm  getting  to  like  more  and  more.  It's  written  the  way  I  talk.  A  kind  of  notebook,  with  my  notions  jotted  down.   So  I  said  to  Photoplay,  "You're  welcome  to  my  diary  if  you  can  make  heads  or  tails  out  of  it.  But  I  warn  you,  it's  a  queer  kind  of  diary.  I  didn't  keep  it  regularly,  and  I  didn't  pay  much  attention  to  dates."   But  you'll  be  surprised  when  you  find  out  what  did  impress  me  most.     Because  I'm  not  going  to   28    In  the  photos,  and  this  sketch,  by  Dobias,  you  see  Clara  getting  her  first  taste  of  winter  sports    tell  you  it  was  old  churches  or  castles  or  museums.  I  liked  them,  of  course.  But  I'm  not  up  enough  on  history  and  art  to  appreciate  them  like  I  should.   Between  you  and  me,  I  bet  lots  of  tourists  who  come  back  raving  about  things  that  are  starred  in  the  guide  books,  just  rave  because  everybody  else  does.  But  the  incidents  and  sights  I  remember  most  vividly  aren't  like  that.   My  two  weeks'  stay  in  St.  Moritz;  my  visit  to  Reims  and  the  day  I  spent  going  through  the  Pomeroy  Greno  champagne  cellar;  the  Berlin  Zoo;  West-  minster Abbey  and  the  Unknown  Soldier's  grave  in  Whitehall,  London;  the  poverty  of  the  lower  classes  in  Europe;  these  are  the  things  that  stuck  with  me.   (Gee,  I'd  like  to  go  around  the  country  telling  what  I  saw  to  all  the  people  who've  got  the  wrong  ideas  about  Europe.  You  can't  realize  how  hard  life  is  over  there  until  you've  had  the  chance  to  see  conditions  with  your  own  eyes!)   The  restaurants  and  shops,  and  the  usual  sight-seeing  didn't  mean  much  to  me.   If  you  think  I'm  crazy  when  I  tell  you  that  I  wasn't  so  keen  about  French  food —  well,  I'm  crazy.    THE  dressmakers  in  Paris  thought  I  was.  Because  the  only  thing  I  bought  was  a  Hair  Seal  Phoque  coat  (the  new  fur  that's  all  the  rage).  I  wore  it  when  I  landed  in  New  York.   But  as  I  told  the  Patous  and  the  Chanels  and  the  Lan-  vins,  "I'm  perfectly  satisfied  with  the  clothes  I  bought  in  America — they  suit  me  bet-  ter.   So  why  change  over?  "   That's  not  patriotism —  that's  just  common  sense.    "Me  trying  skis  for  the  first  time.

Gee,  what  a  place.  Never  felt  more  like  a  million  dollars  in  my  life.

It  sure  is  swell.    Jan.  20th.  Had  my  first  skiing  lesson  yesterday.  Was  it  a  riot?  I  wasn't  scared,  only  uncomfortable  with  those  heavy  boards  on  my  feet.  They  felt  ten  miles  long.   Guess  I'm  impulsive — or  whatever  you  call  it.  Tried  to  do  everything  the  first  day.  The  teacher  here  takes  a  lot  of  interest  in  me.  Says  I  learn  quickly.  Too  quickly,  I  know  now.  So  I  tried  to  learn  everything  at  once,  and  took  a  spill  that  landed  me  in  a  somer-  sault at  the  bottom  of  the  hill.   One  of  my  skis  came  off  and  flew  right  over  a  fifteen  hundred  foot  precipice.    They  make  things  big  here — even  the  precipices.    Just  four  girls  out  for  a  big  time.

This  afternoon  he  thought  he'd  try  some  of  those  loop-the-loop  turns  around  the  side  of  the  moun-  tain on  a  luge  (that's  what  they  call  a  little  sled  here).  The  kind  of  thing  they  do  at  the  Olympics.  Mile-a-minute  turns — and  if  you're  dumped,  good  night.  I  said,  "  Dar-  ling, please  don't  be  reckless."  But  he's  kind  of  headstrong.  So  he  tried.  And  made  it.  Hurray  for  Rex.  .  .  .  We're  both  learning  to  skate,  too.   Jan.  25th.  Rosie  Dolly — one  of  the  famous  Dolly  Sisters — is  here  also.  She's  Mrs.  Netcher  now,  and  lives  in  Europe  most  of  the  time.  I've  always  been  crazy  about  Rosie  — she's  such  good  fun  on  a  party.  Is  always  up  to  anything.  She'll  probably  come  down  to  Monte  Carlo  with  us  .  .  .  Rosie  said  to  me  today,  which  I  thought  was  ter-  ribly sweet  of  her:   "If  they  must  send  movie  ac-  tresses over  here  to  be  entertained  — why  can't  they  all  be  like  you?

And  that  proves  that  some  folks,   [ PLEASE  TURN   TO   PAGE   88  ]   29    ??    I'd  Do  It  Again,"  says  Clark    Eva  line  Lieber    SHALL    a  father  dictate  the  choice  of  profession  for  his  children?   Should  children,  from    a    feeling    of  loyalty,  follow  their  parents'  advice?   This  is  not  a  new  prob-  lem. It's  as  old  as  the  moon,  and  as  ever-present.   And  probably  there  is  no  city  in  the  world  where  the  answers — pro  and  con — are  as  sensationally  illustrated  as  in  Hollywood.   The  case  of  Clark  Gable  is  one  of  the  most  surprising  of  those  many  dramas  which  grow  out  of  a  son's  defiance  of  paren-  tal authority.   Since  he  was  sixteen  years  old  until  a  few  months  ago,  Clark  had   no  idea  where  his  father  lived  or  what  he  was  doing.  And,  though  probably  the  father  was  quite  aware  of  his  son's  sudden  sky-rocketing  to  fame,  he  gave  no  signs  of  being  interested.  Yet  these  two  were  the  only  living  members  of  their  family.   With  Clark's  mother  gone,  the  father  felt  a  double  parental  responsibility  toward  the  young,  impulsive  boy  left  to  his  guidance.  Naturally.  When  there  are  two  influences  to  mold  a  youthful  mind  and  temperament — a  masculine  and  a  fem-  inine—-the  job  is  not  nearly  so  difficult.  If  a  father  and  son  disagree,  there  is  always  the  mother's  interceding  tenderness  to  soften  the  pressure  of  the  quarrel.  To  bring  the  older  man  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  boy's  enthusiasm.    To  temper  the   30    How  Clark  Gable  met  the  world-old  issue —  when  the  wills  of  father  and  son  clash    boy's  stubborn  judgment  of  his  father's  harsh  common  sense.  But   there  was  no  mother's  influence  in  Clark's  adolescent  life.      And  that's  one  reason  the  bitterness  grew.  Clark  was  in  Akron  making  his  initial  fight  for  stage  recognition.    His  father  had  gone  to  Oklahoma  and  established  himself  as  a  con-  tractor for  the  drilling  of  oil  wells.   He  was  prospering.     He  sent  for  the  son.  Clark  went.     The  artistic  inheritance  from  his  mother  urged  him  toward  the  stage.  But  the  tie  with  his  only  remaining  parent  made  him  feel  guilty  of  disobedience — and  in-  spired filial  yearnings.  "When  he  sent  for  me  I  was  happy  to  go  just    to   be   with   him.      But   I    simply  couldn't  stick  to  the  work.     Oil  wells  were  uninteresting,  uninspiring  and  un-  romantic.   "My  father  is  Pennsylvania  Dutch.   He  comes  from  a  people  who  tilled   their  own  land,   who   always   knew   exactly  how  and  from  what  the  next   meal  was  coming.  He  had  a  vision  of   saving  his  money,  putting  it  into  oil   land  and  'striking  it  rich.'   "He    wished    me    to    share    this   vision.    He  expected  me  to  work   with  him,  save  my  money  as  he   saved   his.       He   wanted   us —   father  and  son — to  strike  it  rich   together.     I  was  his  only  son.   But  after  a  trial,  I  knew  that   all  the  money  in  the  world   was  not  worth  my  revulsion   and    rebellion    against    this   work."   That   crucial   scene — com-  mon to  so  many  parents  and  offspring — came  one  afternoon  when  their  work   was  finished.      It  came  more  violentlv  and    "Tie  yourself  so  tightly  to  a  star  that  not  even  a  passing  comet  can  untie  you,"  says  Clark  Gable.     It  was  a  long,  up-hill  fight  that  brought  him  to  such  roles  as  Giovanni — as  here  shown — ■  opposite  Helen  Hayes  in  M-G-M's  production,  "The  White  Sister"    with    more    emotional  undercurrent    than    is"  customary.      Because  there  were  only  the  two    of    them,    and  they  were  closer  to  one  another  than  either  one  of  them  cared  to  admit.   This  father  had  no  other  children  on  whom  he  could  lavish  his  inherited  right  to  parental  domination,  or  his  affection.  The  son,  no  other  parent  to  whom  he  could  turn  for  sympathetic  comprehension.   "I  felt  then  that  I  had  the  right  to  choose  my  own  destiny;  make  my  own  choice  of  vocation.  I  feel  exactly  the  same  way  today.     Only  now  my  father  and  I  agree  about  it.   "There  is  only  one  way  to  get  what  you  want  from  our  brief   visit  on  this  earth.    First,  you  must  know  what  you  want  and   then  set  out  to  get  it,  and  not  allow  anything  to  sidetrack  you.

Such  a  problem  isn't  good  sense.  Be-  cause the  answer  seems  obvious  if  she  really  loves  her  husband.   "The  call  of  a  woman's  heart  certainly  should  be  stronger  than  her  cry  for  fame.  At  least,  that's  the  way  I've  found  it  to  work  out  in  my  life.  I  have  never  been  put  to  the  test  of  pondering  that  question  until  just  recently.  Since  Irving  was  sick.  And  I  now  know  that  no  career,  no  one  picture,  would  ever  be  big  enough  or  important  enough  to  take  me  away  from  him  when  he  needed  me."   Norma  Shearer  told  me  this  a  day  or  two  before  she  and  her  husband,  Irving  Thalberg,  and  their  adorable  son,  Irving,  Jr.,  aged  two-and-one-half  years,  left  for  a  trip  to  Europe.  A  trip  designed  primarily  as  a  rest  for  Thalberg,  the  oft-hailed,  and  correctly,  too,  young  production  genius  of  Metro-Goldwyn-  Mayer,  who  has  been  very  ill  with  a  "flu"  attack.  His  first  serious  illness  during  his  six  years  of  wedded  life  to  Norma.   We  were  seated  in  the  charming  living-room  of  Norma's  beach  house  where  she  and  her  husband  and  child  live  the  year  round.  It  is  situated  right  at  the  seaside,  with  a  retaining  wall  shutting  it  off  from  the  direct  path  of  the  ocean.

Fishing  boats  and  several  picturesque  three-masted  schoon-  ers were  lying  lazily  in  the  sunlit,  blue-green  calm  of  the  sea  that  day  and  the  Venice  pleasure  pier,  a  short  mile  away,  with  its  roller  coaster  and  ferris  wheel,  presented,  a  gay  contrast.   Just  a  few  moments  before  I  had  been  up  in  the  nursery  with  little  Irving  the  while  he  sat  at  his  tiny  table  eating  his  bowl  of  consomme  with  rice,  and  pouring  his  milk  from  a  pitcher  formed  in  the  shape  of  a  very  pert  kitten  and  a  sad-eyed,  lop-  eared  dog.  On  the  rim  of  the  silver  plate  into  which  he  poured  some  of  his  soup,  "because  it's  hot,"  were  engraved  figures  of  quaint  brownies.   "Who  do  you  suppose  those  little  people  are,"  he  asked  me  with  his  precious,  bright  face  turned  up  toward  mine.  The  golden  curls  of  his  bob — curls  which  sadly  enough  went  the  way  of  the  shears  the  following  day  in  order  that  he  could  rightfully  take  his  place  in  the  world  as  a  "little  man" — lov-  ingly caressed  his  sensitive  brow.   "I'll  tell  you  who  they  are,"  he  explained,  in  clear,  intelligent  words.      "They're   Ditty   Bennett   and   Peter   Bennett   and  Barbara   Lyon,   my   little   friends."

But  some  of  the  most  exacting  work,  showing  Doug  Fair-  banks, Jr.  and  Patricia  Ellis  at  high  points    "The   Narrow  Corner'     Stage  Gives    in  the  film,  proved  difficult  to  take  in  the  cabin;  so  this  stage  was  evolved.   The  whole  thing — cabin  and  all — is  mounted    on  one  giant  ball  and  socket  joint,  and  can  be  made  to  rock  as  violently  as  the  most  thrill-  avid  director  could  desire.

Groups  of  husky  stage  hands  at  the  corners  do  the  rocking.

You  may  sit  at  a  restaurant  table  and  be  waited  upon  by  a  once  reigning  toast  of  the  New  York  stage,  or  buy  sheet  music  on  a  street  corner  from  a  man  who  was  reared  in  the  shadow  of  a  throne.   Perhaps  the  man  to  whom  you  toss  a  quarter  for  a  gardenia  has  the  right  to  wear  a  ribbon  in  his  own  buttonhole,  and  the  panhandler  who  touches  you  for  a  cup  of  coffee  was  a  famous  playboy  who  once  threw  away  thousands  in  a  single  night.   But  these  are  the  small-fry  only,  their  stories  so  common  as  to  be  scarcely  worthy  of  comment  any  more.  What  if  the  chap  who  parked  your  car  was  heretofore  a  grand  duke,  with  a  yarn  as  long  as  your  arm  if  you  cared  to  listen — but  you  don't  listen,  because  his  memoirs  are  stale,  trivial  stuff  beside  some  you've  heard.  You  can't  walk  a  block  in  Hollywood  without  bumping  into  some  such  para-  dox or  other;  either  they  were  up  and  are  down,  or  were  down  and  they're  up.   Just  the  same,  there  is  in  Hollywood  one  human  paradox  who  stands  head  and  shoulders  above  all  the  others.  Not  in  stature,  for  physically  he's  only  a  little  fellow;  yet  even  in  Hollywood,  where  the  official  coat-of-arms  is  a  hammer  on  a  field  of  hams  with  jealousy  rampant,  everybody  will  admit  that  he's  the  biggest  shot  in  town.  Yet,  among  all  the  multitudes  of  celebrities,  among  the  world-  famous  throngs  of  soothsayers,  stars,  sycophants  and  supervisors,  he,  the  most  celebrated,  the  most  famous,  the  one  admitted  great  among  all  the  near-great  and  the  would-be  great,  roams  as  a  lost  soul.   He  is  lonely,  because  no  other  soul  can  share  with  him  his  pedestal  of  genius.   He  is  sad,  because  the  laughs  he  has  given  the  world  have  been  born  in  his  own  sorrows.   He  is  a  jester  in  the  court  of  life,  a  Pagliacci  whose  clownish  make-  up ever  hides  the  tear  in  his  heart.   He  has  everything  the  earth  has  to  offer,  yet  nothing  he  wants.  A  pauper  in  contentment,  yet  with  the  whole  world  in  his  grasp.   He  is  a  millionaire,  a  millionaire  many  times  over  in  money,  yet  the  most  humble  home  is  rich  compared  with  him.  Easier,  indeed,  is  it  for  the  camel  to  go  through  the  eye  of  the  needle  than  for  this  rich  man  to  enter  the  heaven  of  happiness — and  he  is  a  millionaire  in  search  of  happiness.   YOU  may  see  him  almost  any  day,  strolling  preoccupiedly  down  the  Boulevard.  Not  as  often  now  as  formerly,  since  the  Boule-  vard has  become  a  tawdry  promenade  of  cheap-jacks  and  jim-  cracks;  still,  quite  often,  even  now.  He  doesn't  see  shop  windows  with  their  catchpenny  junk,  where  jewels,  and  gowns,  and  frankin-  cense and  myrrh  used  to  be;  he  doesn't  see  the  tense  faces  hurrying  by,  the  beggars  and  street-musicians  thronging  where  once  the  stars  were  wont  to  tread.   Somewhere  within  himself  is  the  world  that  he  inhabits,  the  sphere  where  dwells  his  thoughts.  All  he  gives  the  Boulevard  is  a  glimpse  of  a  small,  slight  figure,  wearing  as  like  as  not  a  neat  blue  suit,  a  pair  of  patent-leather,  button-top  shoes,  and  a  plaid  cap  or  his  beloved  bowler  hat.  His  mobile  face,  sensitive  and  plastic  as  a  sculptor's  clay,  is  unmindful  and  expressionless;  his  eyes,  dark  and  deep,  are  like  opaque  windows.  He  can  see  out,  but  you  can't  see  in.   He  looks  straight  in  front  of  him,  scarcely  turning  his  head  from  Vine  Street  to  La  Brea.  You  could  follow  him,  and  he  wouldn't  know.   He  doesn't  see,  among  all  the  others,  another  figure  that  passes  him — a  stocky  figure  of  medium    In  any  group  of  celebrities  he,  the  most  celebrated  one  of  them  all,  roams  like   a  lost    soul    3k    Search  of  Happiness    height,  dressed  in  a  pair  of  old  white  duck  pants  turned  up  almost  to  the  knees,  and  a  threadbare  shirt  without  any  sleeves;  a  man,  older  than  he,  but  looking  much  younger,  whose  bare  head  sways  a  shock  of  long,  blond  hair,  not  yet  white  like  his  own,  and  whose  sandalled  feet  swing  along  at  almost  a  trot.  That's  Peter  the  Her-  mit, bronzed  in  health  and  happy  in  his  heart,  with  a  song  on  his  lips  and  a  smile  on  his  face.   Perhaps  he  hasn't  two  dimes  to  rub  together  or  perhaps  he  has —  you  wouldn't  know,  and  he's  not  caring.  He  has  found  the  fountain-  head  of  life.    He  laughs  at  the  world,  not  the  world  at  him.   Hermit?  No,  not  Peter,  even  if  his  dress  is  eccentric  and  he  does  live  up  in  the  hills.  The  other  guy  is  the  real  hermit.  It  is  he  whom  you  will  find  strolling  down  around  the  East  Side  at  night,  seeking  the  intimacy  of  his  own  thoughts  among  the  pawnshops  and  flopjoints,  among  the  coffee-and-sinker  lunch  counters,  the  dime  movie  houses  that  stay  open  all  night,  the  Rescue  Missions  and  all  the  rest  of  the  haunts  of  human  misery  after  he  has  left  a  party  at  Pickfair  or  a  gathering  of  the  great  at  his  own  mansion — surfeited  with  all  that,  he  wants  to  be  alone.   He  wants  to  smell  again  those  acrid  smells  that  remind  him  of  his  own  native  slums.   He  wants  to  think  again  those  introspective,  creative  thoughts  that  gave  to  the  world  "The  Kid,"  "Shoulder  Arms,"  "A  Woman  of  Paris,"   "City  Lights."   He  wants  to  maroon  himself  upon  an  island  of  his  own  making  in  the  midst  of  a  stream  of  flotsam  and  jetsam;  to  be  at  peace  within  himself  while  the  tide  of  all  earthly  emotion  rushes  by.   And  when  he  tires  of  that  he  gets  into  his  RoDs-Royce  limousine  again  and  is  whisked  back  to  his  own  mausoleum  in  Beverly  Hills,  where  money  has  built  for  him  everything  that  mortal  man  may  desire  — everything,  that  is,  save  the  one  thing  he  is  eternally  seeking  yet  never  can  find :  Happiness.   IN  Hollywood  you  may  buy  with  money  any  commodity  that  the  earth  has  to  offer.  You  may  buy  ancient  baronial  castles,  dis-  mantled in  the  Old  World  and  set  up  here  stone  by  stone;  you  may  buy  almost  priceless  old  masters  as  well  as  ex-cabbages  and  ex-kings.   You  can  buy  brains  and  achieve  fleeting  fame  if  not  immortality;  you  can  buy  human  beauty  and  human  beasts.  You  can  even  buy  the  glorious  saffron  of  the  dawn,  breaking  like  an  eternal  Easter  over  purple  crests  of  the  hills,  and  you  can  buy  the  gorgeous  sunsets,  limitless  diapasons  of  color  far-flung  over  the  mirroring  sea.  All  you  have  to  do  is  pick  your  view.   The  little,  sad-faced  jester  has  money  enough  to  buy  all  of  these.  Some  of  them  he  has  bought.  But  none  of  them  are  worth  a  plugged  nickel  compared  with  the  one  thing  he  lacks.   He  tries  to  encompass  that  one  thing,  seated  at  the  console  of  his  huge  pipe-organ,  a  small,  pathetic  figure  on  the  bench,  alone  in  a  vast,  high-ceilinged  chamber  conjuring  wistful  melodies  out  of  the  fabric  of  his  own  desire.   He  tries  to  find  it  wandering  from  one  room  to  another  in  that  great  mansion  of  his,  a  violin  tucked  beneath  his  chin,  bowing  the  reversed  strings  with  his  left  hand.  Music — it  is  there  somewhere.  It  lurks  in  those  noble  organ  chords,  in  those  trilled  flourishes  of  the  fiddle  beneath  his  fingers.   Moods — they  flow  from  him  like  water  from  a  busted  fire-hydrant.  And  ever  he  pursues  them,  seeking  the  one  mood  that  escapes  him.   He  dives  into  his  ornate  swimming  pool,  floats  dreaming  upon  his  back  with  his  closed  eyelids  upturned  to  the  open  sky.  He  tires  himself  out  upon  his  private  tennis  court,  knocking  balls  like  white  bubbles  here  and  there.  He  goes  to  his  own  studio,  the  only  individual  studio  that  remains  in  Hollywood,  and  loses  himself  in  millions  of  feet  of  film.   The  pathos  he    accomplished  upon  the  screen  is  not  synthetic  mummery.     The  satire  and  irony  he  achieves  are  not  inspiration  from  above.

They  are  Mrs.  Cagney's  little  boys,  though  you  are  probably  more  familiar  with  Jimmy  who  has  won  stellar  honors  in  the  cinema  field.

Why  not  plan  a  twin  role  for  the  lads?    A    W,  no!"  many  of  Buster  Keaton's  friends  in  Hollywood  exclaimed  when  "the  word  was  first  flashed  over  the  radio  from  El  Paso  that  Keaton  had  married  a  girl  named  Mae  Scrivens.   A  little  later,  however,  when  newspapers  and  wire  services  began  carrying  stories,  quoting  Buster  and  Mae  concerning  the  marriage,  these  same  friends  were  mystified  and  here's  why:  Buster  said  they  had  been  married  at  Ensenada,  lower  California,  January  8.   Reporters,  however,  were  unable  to  find  any  record  of  the  marriage  license  having  been  issued.  Judge  Francisco  Maytorena  in  Ensen-  ada said  he  knew  Keaton  but  he  had  "never  married  him  to  anybody."  Buster  countered  by  saying  he  had  made  secret  arrangements  to  keep  it  out  of  the  record  until  his  California  divorce  became  final  in  August.   "My  secretary  in  Hollywood  has  the  mar-  riage certificate,"  Buster  added.   36    The  secretary  kept  a  discreet  silence  other  than  to  admit  he  had  talked  to  Buster  in  El  Paso  over  long  distance  telephone.   "  A  4"  AYBE  they  were  married  in  Mexicali,"  reporters  reasoned.  "They  stopped  off  there  a  couple  of  days  ago."   But  no  record  of  a  wedding  ceremony  could  be  found  at  the  lower  California  border  town.   And  so  the  mystery  is  still  a  mystery.   Mae  has  been  Buster's  nurse  for  about  six  months — since  about  the  time,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  his  wife,  Natalie  Talmadge  Keaton,  obtained  her  interlocutory  decree  of  divorce.   At  times,  Buster  has  been  quite  ill  although  he  has  improved  considerably  since  his  con-  tract with  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  was  ter-  minated. This  trip  to  Mexico  City,  which  caused  Buster,  at  the  international  boundary,  to  declare  he  and  Mae  were  married,  was  planned  to  aid  him  in  regaining  his  health.

Bob,  who  went  with  Betty,  as  he  calls  her,  in  the  days  of    poverty    while    he    at-  tended Lincoln  High  School,    in    Los    Angeles,  was    literally    hurled    into  motion   pictures  slightly  more  than  two  years  ago.  For  an  entire  year,  he  had  an  opportunity  to  meet  and  to  court    almost    every    eligible  girl  player  in  motion  pictures.  Hearing   of    his    Cinderella-like  rise — he  was  a  youngster  stand-  ing on  a  soap  box  to  watch  Douglas  Fairbanks  attending  his  own  pre-  mieres only  a  few  years  ago — young  America  said:     "What  a  break!

But  it  really  doesn't  matter.  For  here  is  an  actress  who  has  so  much  startling  personality  of  her  own,  she  could  afford  to  sublet  some  of  it  to  her  less  fortunate  Hollywood  sisters.

"T  will  kill  any  man  who  plays  it,"  announced  George  Raft  as  he  refused  the  role  of  Pop  Eye,  called  Trigger  in  the  picture,  "The  Story  of  Temple  Drake."  George  suffered  suspension  from  his    Paramount  contract  rather  than  do  it.   '"It  will  make  anyone  who  plays  it, "  answered  Jack  La-  Rue,  as  he  accepted  it.   Jack  received  a  long  term  contract  with  the  company  from  which  George  had  been  suspended.     One  man  must  be  right.     But  which?      It  is  strange'  how  the  paths  of  these  two  men,  who  are  in-  timate personal  friends,  have  crossed  since  their  re-  spective arrivals  in  Holly-  wood.   Jack  LaRue  was  the  first  choice  for  the  Raft  role  in  "Scarface."  The  test  proved  Jack  too  tall.  The  camera  plays  weird  tricks  with  physiques,  you  know.  Jack's  screen-height  empha-  sized Paul  Muni's  screen-  stockiness.   Although  LaRue  is  not  too  tall  or  Muni  too  short  in  life,  the  camera  accentua-  tions made  them  poor  com-  plements. So  George  Raft  was  chosen.   If  it  had  not  been  for  this  unforeseen  screen  illusion,  would  their  positions  up  to  now  have  been  reversed?  Would  LaRue  have  been  the  star  with  big  successes  and  Raft  only  a  character  player  with  minor  roles  to  his  credit?   And  will  the  part  which  Raft  has  turned  down,  do  for  LaRue  what  "  Scarface  "  did  for  Raft?   Here  is  a  Hollywood  situ-  ation— and  the  answer  rests,  I  believe,  with  the  women.   Women  create  or  ruin  screen  heroes.  And  until  women  make  their  choice  at  the  box-office,  no  one  can  tell  whether  an  actor  is  routed  for  fame  or  failure.   Who  could  have  suspected  beforehand,  that  his  role  in  "Scar-  face" would  make  a  star  of  Raft?  The  way  he  played  it  unex-  pectedly opened  one  of  those  mysterious  springs  concealed  within  women.   Who  would  have  thought  that  "Night  Nurse"  or  "A  Free  Soul"  would  have  made  Clark  Gable,  hailed  as  the  successor  of  Valentino?  Had  Rudy  knocked  the  ladies  about  in  his  day,  there  might  have  been  no  Valentino.   And  who  can  foretell  what  Trigger  will  do  for  LaRue,  or  what  it  might  have  done  for  Raft  had  he  gone  through  with  it?   The  part  is  as  devoid  of  sympathy  as  a  desert  river  of  water.  Trigger  is  incapable  of  romance.     He  is  so  inhumanly  cruel  that    According  to  Raft,  the  role  of  Trigger  in  "Temple  Drake"  would  kill  on  the  screen  any  player  who  undertook  it    Jack  LaRue,  on  the  other  hand,  believes  that  whoever  plays  the  part  will  stand  ace  high  with  women  audiences    he  shoots  a  half-wit  boy  who  vacuously  attempts  to  stop  his  betrayal  of  an  in-  nocent girl.   Yet  that  girl,  though  re-  pulsed, horrified,  shows  that  the  elemental  nakedness  of  his  emotions  exerts  a  domi-  nation over  her.   Will  LaRue,  as  Trigger,  create  that  elemental  urge  in  other  women?   Raft  was  afraid  to  take  the  gamble;  LaRuewel-  comes  it.   And  LaRue  bases  his  judgment  upon  a  study  he  has  made   of   women — not  only    from    personal    expe-  riences but  from  the  vantage  point  of  an  actor,  a  night-  club owner  and  a  life-long  resident  of  the  Great  White  Way.  He  believes  that  a  primitive  strain  lies  deep  within  the  phys-  ical side  of  woman — a  strain  which  civilization  has  veneered  but  not  eliminated.    He  tells  of  an  experience  of  a  friend  who  took  his  sweetheart  to  a  night-club  and  caught  her  flirting.   "No  man  can  flirt  with  a  woman  unless  he  is  given  the  op-  portunity," Jack  insists.  "She  either  allows  it  or  she  doesn't.  My  friend  crushed  her  hand  in  his  until  she  cried  out  with  pain,  rose  and  left  her  there  alone.  You  would  have  thought  this  would  have  killed  her  love.

The  story,  conceived  by  the  late  Edgar  Wallace  and  Merian  C.  Cooper,  deals  with  the  adventures  of  Fay  Wray,  Bruce  Cabot  and  Robert  Armstrong,  entangled  with  Kong,  a  monster  ape  fifty  feet  high.  Caught  by  savages,  Fay  is  offered  as  a  sacrifice  to  the  ape.  But  Kong  fancies  her,  as  a  man  might  cherish  a  dainty  flower,  and  fights  dinosaurs  on  her  behalf,  until  Fay's  companions,  using  gas  bombs,  catch  him  for  exhibition  in  New  York.   While  in  Gotham  he  breaks  loose,  seizes  Fay,  and — but  from  there  on  we'll  let  the  film  speak  for  itself.  Suffice  it  to  say,  you'll  get  thrills  such  as  the  screen  rarely  affords.    ^    THE  MASQUERADER—Goldwyn-United  Artists   IF  this  really  turns  out  to  be  Ronald  Colman's  farewell  contribution  to  American  films,  he  will  go  out  on  a  memo-  rable note — for  while  the  story  is  old,  he  lends  it  powerful  appeal  by  sheer  artistry  of  performance.   It  is  perhaps  the  more  interesting  because  Ronald  plays  against  himself — as  the  dissolute,  sinking  member  of  Par-  liament, and  as  the  splendid,  upstanding  cousin,  almost  a  physical  duplicate,  who  steps  in  and  carries  on.  Not  only  in  Parliament,  however;  there  is  a  wife  (Elissa  Landi)  and  a  titled  mistress  (Juliette  Compton)  to  consider.  Their  performances  help  mightily,  as  does  the  fine  mounting.   While  the  picture  would  prove  a  bit  heavy  for  younger  children,  there  is  no  reason  why  older  ones,  as  well  as  adults,  should  not  see  and  enjoy  it.   46    The    Shadow    A  Review  of  the  New  Pictures    it    SWEEPINGS— RKO-Radio    THIS  story  of  a  disillusioned  father  is  so  simply  and  touchingly  told,  it  tears  at  the  heartstrings  and  brings  a  tear  to  every  eye.   Lionel  Barrymore  comes  to  Chicago  with  his  wife  after  the  great  fire  and  begins  a  tiny  store,  thankful  to  wring  out  a  few  pennies  of  profit,  and  dreaming  always  of  bright  times  to  come.  They  do — as  they  did  in  the  Chicago  of  those  days.  With  the  coming  of  each  of  his  four  children,  he  adds  a  new  department,  pouring  his  heart  into  the  fast  growing  and  successful  establishment.   Alone,  his  wife  having  died,  he  tenderly  cares  for  his  four  children,  expecting  them  to  take  over,  with  the  same  love  and  tenderness  that  he  always  poured  forth,  the  manage-  ment of  his  beloved  store,  which  gradually  becomes  the  greatest  in  the  world.   But  by  his  very  success  he  has  sowed  the  seeds  of  their  undoing.  Scorning  mere  "trade,"  they  devote  themselves  to  profligate  spending  of  Lionel's  money,  until  in  the  end  they  all  but  bring  ruin  to  the  mercantile  monument  he  has  reared.   Gloria  Stuart,  William  Gargan,  George  Meeker  and  Eric  Linden  are  splendidly  convincing  as  the  children,  while  Gregory  Ratoff  is  marvelous  as  the  faithful  old  partner.   Here  is  a  picture  that  will  live  in  your  memory.    See  it.

Marion  Crawford  novel —  Helen  Hayes  and  Clark  Gable  reaching  new  heights  in  truly  great  roles — what  more  could  be  needed  for  a  memo-  rable picture?  Nothing — although  superb  mounting  and  Victor  Fleming's  outstandingly  skillful  direction  naturally  heighten  the  appeal  of  this  long-favored  story.   Probably  you  will  remember  the  silent  version  which  swept  the  country  some  years  ago,  for  it  was  through  playing  in  that,  opposite  Lillian  Gish,  that  Ronald  Colman  won  standing  as  one  of  the  screen's  truly  great.  If  so,  any  loss  of  interest  will  be  balanced  by  the  chance  to  compare  two  great  sets  of  performances;  for  here,  with  Helen  Hayes'  wonderfully  sensitive  interpretation,  and  Clark  Gable  giving  a  wonderfully  sympathetic  treatment  of  a  difficult  role,  you  may  join  the  many  who  place  their  achievement  above  that  of  Lillian  and  Ronald.   If  the  story  is  new  to  you,  you  can  imagine  its  pos-  sibilities for  these  gifted  principals,  from  the  fact  that  Helen,  buffeted  by  life,  and  the  supposed  death  of  her  Italian  officer  sweetheart  Giovanni  (played  by  Clark),  seeks  peace  as  a  Catholic  White  Sister,  only  to  have  Giovanni  reappear.  Add  to  this,  superb  support  by  such  players  as  Lewis  Stone,  Louise  Closser  Hale  and  May  Robson,  and  you  have  plenty  of  reason  for  not  letting  yourself  miss  this.    *    A  LADY'S  PROFESSION— Paramount    THOSE  who  think  Alison  Skipworth  and  Roland  Young  are  at  their  best  when  extracting  fun  from  their  foibles  and  such  remarks  as  "Oh,  I  say  now,  old  chap!"  will  have  their  fill  this  time.  Those  without  previous  opinions  will  just  chuckle  and  laugh — so  each  group  will  be  pleased.  The  very  vehicle  is  a  portent  of  fun.  These  titled — and  very  much  busted — principals,  by  some  chance  they  don't  quite  understand,  find  themselves  running  a  speakeasy,  and  getting  rich.  Of  course,  Roland's  daughter  (Sari  Maritza)  and  her  boy  friend  (Kent  Taylor),  as  well  as  the  gangsters  (Roscoe  Karns  and  Warren  Hymer)  mix  in — and  finally  it  all  explodes  in  a  New  Year's  Eve  sort  of  brawl,  a  kidnaping,  a  raid,  and  the  dazed  Britons  leaving  for  home  wondering  just  what  happened.    Plot?    You  won't  miss  it.    *    DESTINATION  UNKNOWN— Universal    HERE  is  a  picture  that  is  daring — not  in  the  old,  trite,  sexy  sense,  but  in  the  full  meaning  of  the  term;  for  it  dares  portray  the  spirit,  if  indeed  not  the  person,  of  Christ  exemplifying  His  promise  of  Divine  forgiveness  and  aid —  even  for,  of  all  people,  a  gang  of  rum-runners,  desperate  and  facing  death  in  a  sinking  ship  caught  in  a  tempest.   To  say  more  would  be  unjust  to  the  picture,  and  its  right  to  be  judged  on  the  story  it  tells  and  the  manner  of  telling.  But  we  can  say  that  Alan  Hale,  Pat  O'Brien  and  Ralph  Bellamy  turn  in  outstanding  performances;  while  Betty  Compson,  discovered  aboard  just  as  this  desperate  mob,  its  water  gone,  is  going  to  end  all  in  a  grand  consumption  of  cargo,  runs  the  tension  of  the  situation  up  to  electric  quality.     Altogether,  an  offering  that's  unusual  and  fine.   47    The  National   Guide  to   Motion    Pictures    (REG.  U.  S.  PAT.  OFF.)

Paul  Lukas  murders  his  faithless  wife;  and  when  his  friend  and  attorney  (Frank  Morgan)  discovers  that  his  own  wife  (Nancy  Carroll)  is  untrue,  he  plans  the  same  crime.  Both  men  are  fine,  but  Nancy  Carroll  somehow  seems  miscast.  Walter  Pidgeon,  Gloria  Stuart,  Donald  Cook,  and  Jean  Dixon  offer  several  good  bits.

"Raised  wild"  among  them,  he  and  his  pals  are  caught  raiding  a  settler,  are  sold  to  a  circus;  then  the  "circus,"  figuratively  as  well  as  literally,  begins.  Buster  escapes,  crashes  Frances  Dee's  house,  is  tamed  by  her.  The  circus  fire  is  thrilling,  with  Buster  rescuing  his  friends,  the  lions.     Fine  animal  stuff.

Excellent  animal  stuff,  and  priceless  circus  atmosphere.  The  much  publicized  black  panther,  however,  is  omitted  and  that  Specialist  comedy  might  better  be.  (Let's  hope  it's  trimmed.)  Clyde  Beatty  thrills  all  as  the  trainer  and  others  in  cast  good.    HERE  is  a  bitter — and  scintillant — picture  of  London  high  society,  as  explored  by  Connie  Bennett,  sophisticated  to  the  hilt  and  without  moral  scruple.  Great,  if  you  like  sparkling  dialogue,  "intelligent"  humor,  and  don't  mind  your  sex — well,  purple;  but  rather  strong  if  you're  squeamish.  Connie  great,  and  Violet  Kemble-Cooper  perhaps  greater;  fine  support  and  lavish  staging.    No  plot — just  a  roast  of  "our  betters."

Doug  Jr.  is  the  light  heavyweight  champ  played  for  a  sucker  and  tripped  by  drink;  country  lass  Loretta  Young  and  her  auntie,  Aline  MacMahon,  get  him  on  the  farm,  pull  him  together — and  does  he  come  back!  Well  played  and  appealing — with  the  aforesaid  proviso.    THIS  one  exposes  the  mind-reading,  crystal-gazing  racket  with  neatness  and  dispatch.  Warren  William,  an  eloquent  carnival  shill,  selects  his  moniker,  Chandra,  from  a  box  of  cookies,  and  rises  to  wreck  some  of  the  best  homes  on  Park  Avenue.  His  able  assistant  is  Allen  Jenkins,  chauffeur,  who  gathers  the  dope  on  philandering  husbands.  Connie  Cummings  almost  reforms  Chandra — but  can  a   phony  go  straight?    THE   CONSTANT  WOMAN—  —World  Wide    CHRIS-  TOPHER  STRONG—  RKO-Radio    NOT  nearly  as  prosy  as  the  title  would  indicate,  but  Eugene  O'Neill  must  have  written  this  one  in  his  much  younger  days.  Claire  Windsor,  as  Conrad  Nagel's  tent-show  wife,  leaves  him  and  her  son  to  go  back  to  her  Broadway  love;  Leila  Hyams,  excellent  as  the  faithful  Lou,  snaps  him  out  of  it.  Tommy  Conlon,  as  the  son  who  leaves  college  and  saves  all,  does  well;  but  Stanley  Fields,  the  roughneck,  takes  the  palm.    THE  story — an  unpleasant  tale  about  a  titled  aviatrix  who  sacrifices  all  in  the  end  to  spare  her  married  lover's  wife —  lacks  two  things  such  a  plot  must  have  for  real  success:  sym-  pathetic development  and  clever  lines.  But  how  it  has  the  third — great  acting — in  Katharine  Hepburn!  She  overrides  the  forced  or  unconvincing  situations.

When  "Employees'  Entrance"  and  "Luxury  Liner"  were  released  recently,  Alice  playing  a  minor  role  in  both  of  them,  simply  put  the  two  pictures  in  her  trim  pocket  and  walked  away  with  them.   Critics  all  over  the  country  dipped  their  pens  in  molasses  and  wrote,  "Alice  White,  picture  stealer."   It  sounded  just  like  an  echo.    An  echo  of  six  years  ago  when  the  White  child  extracted  so  much  meat  from  a  small  part  in  "The  Sea  Tiger"  that  reviewers  were  roused  to  the  point  of  asking,  "Who  is  this  picture  stealer?"   Alice  has  completed  a  seven  year  cycle  covering  the  most  unusual  story  in  that  far  from  usual  town  of  Hollywood.   From  playing  bits  and  stealing  pictures  in  1926,  she  made  a  swift,  dizzy  ascent  to  precarious  stardom.    Then  an  equally  fast  toboggan  down  the  other  side  of  the  slope  brought   her,   seven  years  later,   to  again  playing  supporting  roles  and  again  stealing  pictures.   Many  stars  have  begun  as  extras  or  bit  players,  and  many  stars  have  quietly  slipped  back  into  oblivion,  but  Alice  is  the  only  one  who  has  re-  traced her  steps  and  dramatically  duplicated  her  first  beginning.   And  in  the  story  of  that  accom-  plishment is  an  example  of  courage,  determination  and  will  power  out  of  all  proportion  to  the  ninety-odd  pounds  of  blonde  pulchritude  that  embodied  these  attributes.   No  one  could  have  told  you  then,  and  least  of  all  Alice  her-  self, why  stardom  for  her  was  of  such  short  duration;  why  Hollywood  turned  a  cold  shoulder  after  she  reached  the  top.   No  one  ever  questioned  her  ability.  No  one  ever  questioned  her  drawing  power  with  the  movie  followers.  Then  what?  I'll  tell  you.   The  successful  star,  and  one  who  holds  her  lofty  seat  the   50    By   May   Allison   Quirk    But  what  a  smart  girl  !    First  that  knockout  vaudeville  tour — then  getting  her-  self well  in  hand.    Now  she's  back — and  see  the  new  Alice,  with  that  poised  something  behind  the  zip  that's  going  to  make  the  new  Alice  a  real  winner    longest,  has  to  be  a  combination  of  actress,  politician  and  sound  business  woman.    Just  being  a  great  actress  gets  one  no   further    than    their  first  good  part,  if  that.  Alice  lacked  one  very  im-  portant asset  for  maintain-  ing screen  success:  good  judgment.   And  she  possessed  to  the  nth  degree    one    of    the    cardinal  virtues,  and  one  least  appreci-  ated— honesty  of  soul.     And  it  threw  her.   I  can  say  this  now  because  the  years  in  between  have  given  Alice  a  new  perspective  on  herself  and  Hollywood.  A  new  wisdom  that  will  add  immeasur-  ably to  her  future  happiness  and  carry  her  to  a  second  and  more  lasting  success.  From  the  time  that  Alice  White's  mop  of  light  brown  hair  and  dancing  eyes  came  over  the  horizon,  I  have  always  felt  a  little  sorry  for  her.  Nature  had  endowed  her  with  so  much  of  everything  necessary  for  a  screen  success,  and  yet  she  seemed  a  pathetic  figure.  She  was  so  terribly  alone.  Alone  in  the  sense  of  fighting  her  own  battles  without  a  guiding  hand  to  steer  her  clear  of  studio  pitfalls.  Of  course,  few  immature  people  have  good  judgment,  and  Alice  was  very  young  when  the  full  glare  of  fame  broke  upon  her.  But  most  youngsters  have  a  mother,  relative  or  an  interested  friend  to  lend  mature  counsel  along  the  way.  Alice  had  only  her  grandparents,  older  people  to  whom  a  picture  studio  was  a  complete  mystery.

You  see,  at  heart  I  am  shanty  Irish — so  I  recovered  my  sense  of  humor  and  my  sanity  in  time."  That  is  how  Ina  Claire  looks  back  upon  her  film  invasion  of  Hollywood.   Miss  Claire  has  been  appearing  on  Broadway  in  a  stage  play,  "Biography,"  sponsored  by  the  Theatre  Guild.  The  comedy  is  one  of  the  hits  of  the  season.   The  comedienne  occupies  a  smart  apartment  at  the  Pierre.  She  wore  a  striking — and  highly  effective — red  lounging  negligee  when  she  greeted  me.  "At  least  I  stage  my  inter-  views properly,"  she  laughed.  And  kicked  the  trailing  robe  into  position.   "Tea  or — ?"  she  inquired.  I  didn't  take  tea.   Miss  Claire  returned  to  the  subject  of  Hollywood.  "I  went  to  Hollywood  with  a  film  contract  calling  for  a  big  salary  as  screen  salaries  go.  When  you  go  out  there  that  way  you  are  courting  disaster.  You  find  the  whole  colony  lined  up  in  two  divisions,  for  and  against  you.  You  can  guess  which  is  the  big  division.  The  slightest  thing  you  do,  any  chance  remark,  provides  ammunition  for  the  pros  and  cons.   "To  begin  with,  Hollywood  isn't  real.  Even  the  flowers  are  the  sort  that  shouldn't  be  growing  there.  Artificial  snow  is  tossed  from  airplanes  at  Christmas  time.  The  whole  place  is  tinselly,   garish,   false.   ""N/'OU  go  to  parties  and  you  find  everyone  talking  about  them-   i-  selves,  seriously,  argumentatively,  plaintively.  Motion  pictures  are  the  sole  item  of  conversation.  Then  Hollywood  begins  to  numb  you.  The  more  sophisticated  you  are,  the  harder  you  fall.  The  atmosphere  gets  you,  acts  as  an  an-  aesthetic.   "Things  that  you  know  down  deep  are  tenth  rate  become  first  rate  and  vice  versa.  Your  standards  are  turned  topsy-  turvy. You  find  yourself  seeking  out  strangers  so  that  you  can  talk  about  yourself,  like  everybody  else.   "Because  I  wear  smart  clothes  on  the  stage,  they  welcomed  me  as  an  arbiter  of  fashion,  thereby  annoying  a  lot  of  local  arbiters.  When  I  burst  out  in  three-year-old  dresses,  too  short  for  current  styles,  I  had  to  explain  it  all — and  live  up  to  my  publicity — by  saying  that  only  the  ultra  over-dressed  went  in  for  long  gowns."   Miss  Claire  laughed.  "I'm  always  pictured  reclining  on  a  chaise-longue  in  an  up-to-the-second  Paris  creation,"  she  said.  "Off  the  stage  I  spend  little  on  clothes.  I'd  rather  sit  on  the  floor  in  any  old  thing.   "Well,  I  went  Hollywood  along  with  the  rest,"  continued  the  comedienne.  "I  am  ashamed  of  the  emotions  I  put  on  display,  of  the  squawks  I  made  to  high  heaven.  Do  you  want  to  know  how  I  came  to  my  senses  ?

Now  she's  resumed  her  Broadway  hit  pace  in  "Biography"   51    Another  wellspring  of  inspiration  to  Ann —  her  daughter  Jane,  born  in  1928,  during  an  interlude  in  her  engagement  with  the  "Mary  Dugan"  company.  And  it  was  Jane,  in  some  measure,  who  placed  her  in  films — for  by  resuming  work  too  soon  after  the  baby  came,  Ann  was  forced  to  seek  a  long  rest  and  de-  cided on  California — with  results  we  know    My  Sister,  Ann  Harding    At  last  her  years  of  stern  struggle  to  perfect  her  art  blossom  into  achievement  acclaimed  the  world  over   By  Edith    Gatley  Nash    PART  III   THE  company  was  now  housed  in  a  shabby,  bare,  frame  dwelling,  containing  only  a  few  absolute  essentials.  Ann's  only  extravagance  that  winter  consisted  of  going  to  a  few  Philadelphia  Symphony  Orchestra  concerts.  She  would  take  an  early  train  into  the  city,  carefully  spread  a  newspaper  on  the  steps  of  the  Academy  of  Music  to  save  her  one  coat,  and  sit  there  patiently  until  the  box-office  opened.  Being  the  first  in  line  she  was  at  least  sure  of  getting  an  unre-  served fifty-cent  seat  up  under  the  roof,  where  she  would  lose  herself  for  a  few  hours  under  the  spell  of  Stokowsky's  superb  orchestra.   She  was  completely  broke  by  spring,  a  condition  which  she  never  enjoyed.  Being  congenitally  unable  to  borrow  money,  she  decided  to  show  up  in  New  York  and  see  what  happened.  She  ran  into  two  or  three  managers,  including  Al  Woods  who  asked  her  where  she  had  been  all  this  time  and  told  her  to  come  around  to  his  office — he  might  find  something  for  her.   That  sounded  a  little  vague,  so  she  told  him  where  she  could  be  reached  and  returned  to  Hedgerow.  In  two  weeks  she  got  a  wire — "I  told  you  to  show  up.  Come  and  see  me. "  Hedge-  row scraped  together  enough  money  to  buy  her  a  ticket  to  New  York  and  she  went  to  see  Woods,  who  gave  her  three  very  terrible  plays  to  take  home  and  read.  When  she  returned  them  and  said  that  she  could  not  see  her  way  clear  to  being  a  part  of  any  of  them,  he  told  her  that  Colonel  Savage  had  a  play  that  she  might  like;  to  go  and  see  him.   The  Savage  office  was  a  few  doors  down  the  street.  Ann  went  up  and  met  the  famous  old  producer,  who  was  in  con-  ference with  Rollo  Lloyd  and  Lou  Wiswell.  They  handed  her  the  script  of  "Stolen  Fruit,"  asking  her  to  go  over  it  at  home  and  come  back  to  read  it  for  them  the  next  day.  At  the  end  of  her  reading,  those  three  old-timers  of  the  theater  were  un-  ashamedly dissolved  in  tears.  Rollo  and  Mr.  Wiswell  considered  the  matter  closed  and  looked  expectantly  at  the  Colonel.   Not  wishing  to  appear  too  anxious,  he  erred  on  the  other  side,  to  the  point  of  rudeness.  "Hmm,  yes,  well,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  Miss  Harding,  I  had  thought  of  a  brunette  in  the  part.  "  (Rollo  groaned.)   "T  AM  obviously  a  blonde,  Colonel  Savage,"  Ann  replied  in  JL  slightly  chilled  tones,  "  and  I  understand  you  have  a  marked  aversion  to  wigs.     May  I  ask  what  prompted  you  to  waste  so  much  of  your  time  on  me?"   "One  or  two  other  ladies  are  going  to  read  for  me,"  he  said,  rising  to  indicate  the  conclusion  of  the  interview.  "If  you  will  leave  your  name  and  address  with  my  secretary  she  will  let  you  know  if  we  can  use  you. "   His  was  the  first  discourtesy  she  had  encountered  in  the  profession.   "  If  you  are  interested  in  looking  farther  afield  for  the  casting  of  the  part,  Colonel  Savage,  I  see  no  reason  for  cluttering  up  your  files  with  my  name  and  address.

Ex-actor:  "Shush,  I'm  waiting  for  the  wolf"    Who's    Hollywood    THERE'S  just  one  thing  about  it.  If  this  keeps  up  we'll  all  be  writing  fan  letters  to  a  chimpanzee.  Clark.  Gable  will  be  playing  extra  to  a  moth-eaten  lion  and  Garbo  will  be  taking  a  back  seat  for  a  hippo.  For  I  tell  you,  Hollywood  has  never  seen  anything  like  this  animal  craze.   The  gangster  cycle  came  and  went,  the  horror  cycle  came  and  went  (Yoo  hoo,  Karloff),  and  now  comes  the  most  con-  tagious cycle  of  all.  And  one  that  apparently  has  no  notion  of  "wenting."  One  that  threatens  to  make  a  monkey  of  the  whole  business.  Why,  there's  just  no  stopping  it.  For  Holly-  wood has  gone  animal  with  a  bang.  And  not  animal  crackers,  either.   No  longer  are  we  contented  with  a  mere  cowboy's  horse  or  a  villain-chasing,  virtue-protecting,  police  dog.  Or  good  old  Mickey  Mouse.  Oh  no!  What  Hollywood  wants  and  gets  are  man-eating  tigers,  Christian-eating  lions,  stampeding  ele-  phants, swinging  chimpanzees  and  temperamental  leopards.  Give  a  director  two  hyenas,  one  porcupine,  an  ape  and  a  slightly  intoxicated  penguin,  and  he  will  turn  out  a  classic  that  will  knock  you  out  of  your  seat.   Actors  are  shoved  aside.  Nemo  gets  the  part  they  expected.  Or  Nippo,  the  happy  hippo.  Many  a  little  blonde  sits  on  the  curbstone  weeping  into  her  handkerchief;  "The  director  says  I'm  not  the  type  for  the  kangaroo  romance.  Kangy  prefers  brunettes."   The  perfumed  vamp  no  longer  rests  comfortably  on  a  tiger  skin  and  emotes.  Today,  the  perfumed  tiger  sits  calmly  on  the  vamp  and  purrs  a  mean  meow.   Producers'    meetings    are    something    beyond    the    wildest  imagination.     "Listen,"  one  screams,  pounding  on  the  table,  "what  the  public  wants  is  new  faces.    New  faces,  you  hear  me.  We  can't  keep  on  giving  them  Leo!  Sure  he  has  a  snoot  full  of  'it',  but  they're  getting  tired  of  Leo.

Now,  Nemo  has  everything.  She  has  a  swell  blonde  mane,  parted  in  the  middle.  She  has  a  classy  little  East  African  accent  in  her  snarl,  that  gets  the  men.  She  swings  a  fancy  tail.  And  can  raise  twice  the  er — er — commotion  that  Leo  can."   "But,  listen,"  shouts  another,  "Nemo  won't  work  without  Lubitsch.  You  know  that.  Lubitsch  brings  out  that  little  touch  of  pixie  in  Nemo  that  no  one  else  can  bring  out."   "All  right,  all  right,  if  Nemo  wants  Lubitsch,  who  am  I  to  stand  in  the  way  of  what  an  artist  wants.  But  get  Nemo."  And,  as  an  afterthought  murmurs,  "And  get  Lubitsch,  too."   With  ten  animal  pictures  raging  in  Hollywood  at  once,  an  extra  wearily  made  the  rounds  of  the  casting  offices.  No  work.  Only  six  hyenas  (with  or  without  fleas)  and  one  turtle,  were  wanted  that  day.  The  next  morning,  the  extra  stole  the  bear  rug  off  Sam  Goldwyn's  office  floor,  and  immediately  got  the  lead  in  "Burning  Passion  of  the  Icy  North."  Twenty-seven  bear  rugs,  twelve  lapin  coats  and  Sid  Grauman's  hair  were  missing  in  Hollywood  by  six  o'clock  that  night.   Gary  Cooper  sat  in  the  Brown  Derby  and  groaned,  "Here  I  am,  with  years  of  hard  work  behind  me.  I've  struggled  and  I've  fought,  to  gain  a  top  place  in  movies.  And  what  happens?  I  bring  back  Toluca,  my  chimp,  from  Africa,  and  they  go  wild  for  her.  Producers  claw  each  other  to  get  her.  And  pay  her  twice  the  salarv  I  get.

Me,  Baby  LeRoy,  a  movie  star!  Well,  I  never  dreamed  I'd  come  to  this.  After  my  nine  long  months  of  life,  who'd  have  thought  it  would'  come  to  this?  A  movie  actor!  It  only  goes  to  show,  you  never  know.  One  morning  you  get  up  to  a  sane  dish  of  prunes  and  a  respectable  piece  of  zwieback  and  by  nightfall,  what?  You're  a  movie  actor  with  monograms  on  your  diapers  and  caviar  in  your  tomato  juice.  What  a  world!   You  see,  it  happened  like  this.  A  lot  of  men  came  out  to  a  place  where  I  and  a  bunch  of  other  babies  lay  around,  and  they  picked  up  this  one  and  that  one  and  said,  "Whosooms,  cootest,  ittle,  bittle  tweetums,"  or  some  crazy  thing  (between  you  and  me  they're  all  daft  in  this  business),    As  Told  B}  To  Sara    and  finally  they  came  to  me.   I  took  one  look,  just  one  look,  mind  you,  at  a  fel-  low they  called  Chevalier  and  that  ended  it.  He  had  such  a  grand  lip  for  grabbing  hold  of,  I  reached  up  and  made  one  clutch,  just  one  little  clutch,  and  they  picked  me  for  a  movie  star.  One  innocent  clutch,  and  look.  Well,  all  I  have  to  say  is  this,  never  clutch  a  French-  man's lip.  Look  where  it  got  me.   The  next  week,  I  went  over  to  the  studio  to  be-  gin work.  The  first  thing  I  spied  was  the  script  of  the  picture  I'm  starring  in.  It's  called  "A  Bed-  time Story."  Now  mind.  Whoever  thinks  up  these  titles  is  a  honey.  I  could  think  up  a  better  title  than  that  with  a  milk  bottle  in  one  hand  and  a  rubber  nipple  in  the  other.   Well,  anyway,  I  opened  the  script  and  here  was  this  guy  Chevalier  plas-  tered all  over  the  picture.  "Enter  Chevalier  here,"  it  said,  and,  "Enter  Chev-  alier there."  Well,  after  all,  I  have  my  own  inter-  ests to  look  after,  so,  while  no  one  was  looking,  I  chewed  up  six  of  Chev-  alier's most  dramatic  se-  quences out  of  the  first  reel  and  nine  violent  love  scenes  out  of  the  fourth  reel.  To  this  day,  no  one  knows  the  best  acting  Chevalier  ever  had  a  chance  to  do  is  inside  my  tummy.  And,  did  I  have  a  tummy  ache?     The  love  scenes  nearly  finished  me.   The  first  thing  they  did  was  to  take  off  my  rompers  and  put  me  into  a  dress.  Imagine!  The  humiliation  of  that!  I  sup-  pose they  gave  the  rompers  to  Dietrich  who  goes  in  for  that  sort  of  thing.  But,  after  all,  a  guy  needs  his  pants.  What  the  heck!   And  what  a  dress  it  was!  Torn  and  patched  and  dirty!  And  not  only  that,  but  they  handed  me  a  pair  of  button  shoes  that  went  out  of  style  with  grandma's  pompadour.  Button  shoes!

Carl  De-Voy    "OTRONG,  silent  man,  not  to  be  daunted,"  they  call  Jack  Holt.  Without  ^  ballyhoo,  he  forged  ahead  to  stardom  years  ago.  And  when  the  scythe  was  used  to  clear  away  scores  of  onetime  famous  heroes  "who  wouldn't  do  for  talkies,"  strong-jawed  Jack  pushed  on  to  even  greater  success.  His  latest  star'  ring  role  is  in  Columbia's  film  tentatively  titled  "Tampico"  with  Fay  Wray    w    Why  ill  Return  to  the  otage    It's  a  love  of  old  friends,  and  the  theater  is  one   of  them   As  Told  By  Helen  Hayes   To  Ruth  Biery    FOR  one  year  motion  pictures  will  lose  one  of  its  most  vital  per-  sonalities. Following  her  next  picture,  Helen  Hayes  will  return  to  Broad-  way for  at  least  a  twelve  months'  period.   This  is  not  because  she  dislikes  pictures.  Although  Helen  originally  refused  to  make  pictures  because  of  a  sincere  feeling  that  she  was  not  beautiful  enough.  And  although  she  could  not  shake  stage  home-sickness  from  her  for  many  months  after  she  did  come  to  Holly-  wood, she  has  learned  to  like  the  work  of  that  strange,  mad  place.   But  the  stage  is,  to  Helen,  a  true  and  trusted  friend.  The  motion  picture  indus-  try is  an  acquaintance!   Friendship  has  roots —  roots  so  deep  that  they  can-  not be  eradicated.   Acquaintanceship  has  charm!  A  relationship  based  upon  charm  is  easily  interrupted — even  for-  gotten.   So  Helen  feels  that  she  must  return  to  the  friend,  at  least  temporarily,  and  leave  the  acquaintance.     Perhaps  she  will  further  enjoy  the  charm  of  the  new  acquaintance,  sometime,  but  she  will  never  again  leave  the  friend  for  so  long  a  period.   "Friendship  is  so  rare.  It  never  forgets,"  Helen  Hayes  said.  "If  Katherine  Cornell  does  one  bad  play,  no  one  thinks  of  suggesting  that  she  is  slipping.  But  if  a  picture  star  makes  one  poor  picture,  producers  immediately  talk  about  'jacking  up'  that  person.  One  little  failure  against  a  dozen  huge  successes!  Acquaintances  forget  so  easily."   Hers  was  a  beautiful  comparison  between  the  stage  and  screen.    Friendship  versus  acquaintance!    How  often  we  hear    Here  she  was,  in  1913,  Helen  Hayes  at  the  start  of  her  professional  career,  and  destined  to  travel  far.  She  was,  a  member  of  the  Columbia  Stock  Company,  playing  Washington,  D.C.    No  wonder  that  many  hail  Helen  as  filmdom's  most  talented  actress!  A  portrait  that  hints  of  the  little  star's  remarkable  capac-  ity for  reflecting  the  spirit  of  any  role,  unhampered  by  previous   typing    people  say,  "She  has  more  friends  than  any  woman  I  know,"  or  "Did  you  ever  see  a  man  with  so  many  friends?"   Don't  you  wonder  how  many  are  friends  and  how  many  acquaintances?   Helen  Hayes  does.   "  I  always  suspect  anyone  who  has  too  many  friends  or  tries  to  make  many,"  said  Helen.  "A  person  cannot  spread  butter  effectually  on  too  large  a  piece  of  bread.  A  person  cannot  spread  true  emotion  and  loyalty  on  too  many  people.  Too  much  bread  means  eventual  waste  of  butter.  Too  many  friends  mean  a  waste  of  emotion.   "Just  as  a  person  who  has  one     [  please  turn  to  page  96  ]   69    lells  What  Saved    NORMA  SHEARER  sent  for  me  shortly  after  she  was  married.  She  was  in  the  midst  of  making  "The  Last  of  Mrs.  Cheyney,"  and  I  saw  that  if  the  star  didn't  take  off  those  extra  pounds  she  had  acquired,  it  would  be  the  last  of  Norma  Shearer's  screen  career.  Norma  knew  it,  too.  For  she  is  one  of  the  smartest  girls  ever  on  the  screen.  Her  life  spells  ambi-  tion and  she'll  go  through  any  amount  of  work  and  torture  if  it  will  help  her  career.   She  and  Irving  Thalberg  had  just  rented  the  Elsie  Janis  home —  a  big  house  in  Beverly  Hills.  I  knew  the  place  well  for  I  had  often  been  there  when  Elsie  lived  in  it ;  but  how  different  it  was  now !   When  Elsie  had  it  her  house-  hold included  about  a  million  birds,  a  couple  of  barking  dogs,  several  Persian  cats  and  plenty  of  alley  cats.  You  can  imagine  the  noise.   But  the  first  night  I  went  to  see  Norma  and  a  polite  butler  let  me  in,  all  was  quiet.  Norma  Shearer  could  never  live  in  confusion.  She  now  welcomed  me  and  came  straight  to  the  point — or,  rather,  to  the  curves.  She  was  heavy  in  the  arms,  hips  and  legs,  and  right  away  we  went  into  the  bedroom  where  I  started  to  pound  her.  But  before  I  tell  you  the  treatment  I  gave  I  must  tell  you  a  funny  thing  that  happened  as  a  result.  I  had  put  a  big  Turkish  towel  under  her  and  when  I  left  she  fell  asleep  without  removing  the  towel.   The  next  morning  when  she  woke  up  there  were  little  red  marks  all  over  her  body.  She  thought  sure  that,  in  my  treat-  ment, I  had  broken  her  delicate  skin.  What  hysterics!  What  carryings-on!  Frantically,  she  called  me  up  and  told  me  what    CT*I7IS  revealing  story  of  what  ■*■  America's  most  famous  mas-  seuse and  beauty  culturist  did  for  one  of  screendom' s  favorite  stars,  shows  what  expert  help  you  now  can  have — thanks  to  Sylvia's  great  new  offer.

Look  now  and  see  how  to  take  advantage  of  this  splendid  new 'help.    had  happened.  Suddenly,  I  thought  of  the  towel — it  was  the  marks  made  by  sleeping  on  that  that  had  made  her  skin  look  mottled.   For  I  don't  want  you  to  forget  that  no  matter  how  delicate  a  per-  son's skin  is,  if  you  follow  my  advice  to  the  letter,  it  won't  hurt  you.  Norma  has  the  most  beauti-  ful skin  of  any  star  I  have  ever  treated!   Norma's  was  a  different  case  and  if  you  have  any  of  the  ail-  ments that  Norma  had,  then  I  can  tell  you,  as  I  told  her,  how  to  get  rid  of  them.  I  had  to  be  very  careful  with  her  legs,  for  only  the  outside  parts  needed  reducing,  I  could  not  touch  the  inside.   AND  if  this  is  your  trouble,  here's  what  you  should  do.  Get  a  girl  friend  to  help  you.  Put  your  foot  on  the  friend's  shoulder  (you  are  lying  down,  she  is  standing  up).  Now,  have  your  friend  take  your  heel  in  one  of  her  hands  and  pull  it  while  with  the  palm  of  her  other  hand  she  presses  against  the  toes  and  sole  of  your  foot.  It  is  an  alternate  movement  that  works  wonders  for  reducing  the  outside  of  the  legs.  It's  very  much  the  same  movement  that  one  would  use  in  pulling  a  riding  boot  off  someone  else.   See  how  it  works?  Pull  on  the  heel,  press  on  the  toes,  and  have  your  friend  do  this  just  as  hard  as  you  can  stand  it.  It's  a  marvelous  exercise!  And  is  relaxing  and  soothing.   Norma  was  very  tired.  She  had  been  working  hard  and  trying  to  look  after  her  house  at  the  same    Norma  Shearer,  as  she  appeared  some  time  before  the  call  went  out  for  Sylvia's  aid.  Lovely  then,  but  still—     (At  top  left,  Sylvia)    No    rma    Sh    earer  s    ure    Lots  Of  Sylvia's  Answers,  Girls,  On  Page  84!    time,  so  I  had  two  problems — to  soothe  her  as  well  as  take  off  the  excess  flesh.  Here's  how  I  did  it.  With  a  little  cold  cream  on  my  hands  I  ran  my  fingers  up  and  down  her  spine.  You  can  do  this  for  yourself.  Then  very  gently  I  rubbed  her  back.  This  relaxed  her  and  made  her  ready  for  the  hard  pounding  I  gave  her  later.   ON  every  part  of  her  body  that  needed  reducing  I  broke  down  the  fatty  tissues  by  taking  up  the  flesh  in  my  fingers  and  squeezing  hard,  letting  the  flesh  slip  through  my  fingers  as  if  it  had  been  mashed  potatoes.  That,  girls,  will  take  off  lumps  of  flesh  in  the  de-  sired places.  Then  I  finished  by  putting  a  Turkish  towel  over  the  spots  that  needed  reducing  and  pounded  with  the  flat  of  my  hand.  So  you  can  see  that  with  first  the  soothing  back  treatment  and  then  the  squeezing  hard  treatment,  you  are  both  relaxed  and  stimulated.  But  besides  being  overweight  Norma  was  anemic.  That's  the  cry  I  get  from  so  many  girls.  "I  can't  reduce  because  I'm  anemic."  Well,  Norma  was  anemic  and  she  reduced  and  in  one  week  I  built  her  red  corpuscles  up  twenty  per  cent.   I  didn't  put  her  on  a  drastic  diet.  I'm  ashamed  to  admit  it,  but  I  even  let  her  eat  pie.  My  con-  science hurt  me  about  that — but  Lord!  how  that  girl  loved  pie!  However,  I  made  her  do  some  other  things.  And  you  anemic,  plump  girls  (or  thin  girls  either  for  that  matter)  can  do  the  same  things.  In  a  kettle  of  cold  water  put  a  combination  of  turnip  tops,    What  could  be  more  charming  than  the  Norma  that  emerged  after  a  short  time — svelte,  poised  and  queenly,  in  her  new  radiant  charm?    green  leaves  of  celery  and  green  leaves  of  lettuce  (the  sort  that  you  don't  use  on  the  table  because  they  don't  look  pretty).   Now,  over  a  slow  fire  let  this  simmer  for  an  hour  or  so.  Press  all  the  juice  out  of  the  greens  and  drink  the  liquid.  I'll  admit  it  doesn't  taste  like  a  cocktail,  but  it  isn't  so  bad.  Don't  put  any  salt  in  this.   DRINK  two  big  glasses  of  this  every  day.  And  drink  plenty  of  tomato  juice.  Have  a  green  salad  every  day,  preferably  lettuce  and  tomatoes.  Take  liver  extract.  Eat  very  rare  steaks  and  have  calf's  liver  at  least  twice  a  week;  but  here's  the  way  to  prepare  it.   Get  the  liver  half  an  inch  thick.  Don't  fry  it,  broil  it  so  that  none  of  the  juice  runs  out  of  it.   Have  gelatine  every  single  day.  And  oh,  how  much  better  you'll  feel!  Oh  yes,  and  don't  forget  to  eat  the  skin  of  your  baked  potatoes,  for  they  give  you  mineral  salt.   And  here's  where  you  girls  can  take  a  lesson  from  Norma.  She  was  a  grand  girl  to  treat,  for  if  she  believes  in  you,  she  will  do  anything  you  say.  She  never  doubted  me — and  nothing  was  too  hard  for  her  to  do.  And  all  the  time  she  was  taking  my  strenuous  treatments  she  was  be-  ing an  excellent  housewife,  for  Norma,  who  seems  so  sophisticated  on  the  screen,  is  an  old-fashioned  wife.   She  is  very  domestic,  manages  her  home  beautifully,  and  is  al-  ways concerned  about  Irving's  comfort.  I've  heard  her  declin-  ing invitations  many  times,  in-  vitations that  she  might  have  liked  to  accept,  but  she  knew  that  Irving  needed  to  rest.  She  told  me  often  that  had  she  not  been  under  my  care,  she  couldn't  have  done  all  that  was  demanded  of  her  as  wife,  star  and  mother.  The  things  I  tell  you  to  do,  girls,  give  you  pep.   IT  was  a  conversation  between  Norma  and  Irving  that  started  Norma's  amazing  screen  versatil-  ity. I  heard  that  conversation.  One  night  while  I  was  treating  her,  Irving  and  she  were  talking  about  a  story  that  she  wanted  to  do,  but  he  told  her  she  was  not  the  type.  I  could  feel  Norma's  jaw  set  and  I  know  that  that's  why  she  set  out  to  show  him  she  wasn't  any  type,  but  could  play  any  role.  But  even  if  Norma's  husband  is  her  boss,  she  gets  less  consideration  about  little  things  at  the  studio  than  the  other  stars.

The  odor  is  noticeable  to  others  even  when  you  aren't  aware  of  it  yourself.    MANY  girls  say,  "I  never  per-  spire." It's  easy  to  fool  our-  selves this  way,  but  we  can't  fool  other  people.   We  all  perspire — frequently  over  a  quart  a  day,  doctors  say.  We  don't  feel  sticky  because  underthings  ab-  sorb the  perspiration.  The  odor  is  bound  to  cling.  Others  notice  this  so  quickly — before  we  do  ourselves.   That  is  why  it's  never  safe  to  wear  underthings  a  second  day.  Dainty  girls  won't  risk  offending.  They  take    this  simple  precaution — wash  under-  things in  Lux  after  every  wearing.   Protect  daintiness  this  way   Lux  is  especially  made  to  remove  per-  spiration safely.  These  dainty  suds  take  away  odor,  and  save  color  and  fabric.  Perspiration  contains  harm-  ful substances  that  wear  out  silk.

By   Carolyn   Van  Wyck    A    PLACE   for  everything   and  everything   in   its  place,"   is  what  Sue  Carol's  felt  bag  boasts.    STYLE  is  a  wind  that  blows  us  all  hither  and  yon.  Sometimes  it  is  a  kindly  wind,  blowing  us  all  to  best  advantage,  then  again  it  restricts  and  limits  us.   I  am  afraid  of  this  mannish  vogue.  I  am  afraid  that  too  many  of  you  girls  will  fall  heavily  for  it.  Pants  and  mannish  shirts  and  tight  hair  cuts  are,  I  must  admit,  a  great  novelty  for  those  of  us  who  have  worn  curls  and  romantic  clothes  for  the  last  few  years.  They  are  refreshing,  in  a  way.  But  I  can  predict  right  now  that  a  lot  of  you  girls  who  fall  for  them  too  heavily  will  be  doing  yourselves  out  of  dates,  nice  escorts  and  maybe  even  husbands.  You  will  have  to  have  per-  sonality-plus to  wear  these  things  and  get  away  with  them  with  people  you  meet  for  the  first  time.  With  old  friends,  of  course,  that's   another  matter.   However,  I  can  forgive  you  the  pants,  the  mannish  collars,  anything  almost  but  the  mannish  hair  cut.  Now  and  then  a  girl  may  look  chic  and  attractive  with  a  very  close  cropped  head,  but  I  doubt  if  many  of  you  would.  However,  if  the  urge  overtakes  you,  do  consider  the  matter  seriously;  or,  better,  consult  a  good  hairdresser  and  follow  her  advice.

'T'HE  whole  spring  make-up  tendency  is  ■*■  toward  brighter  and  fairer  tones — a  tendency  that  goes  well,  by  contrast,  with  the  tailored  mode.  One  salon  features  a  red  poppy  shade  in  lipstick  and  rouge  for  all  tones  of  skin.  Unquestionably,  these  bright,  vivacious  tones  are  more  in  keeping  with  spring  than  heavier,  darker  ones.  They  lend  animation,  youthful  freshness  to  the  face  and  are  particularly  becoming  with  beige  and  gray  tweeds  and  navy  blue  tailleurs.   Peachbloom  tone  in  face  powder  is  an  all-  type  shade.  The  very  dark  shades  are  being  discarded,  and  a  good  thing.  Few  of  us  can  darken  our  natural  skin  tones,  except  through  an  even  tan  of  the  sun,  and  flatter  ourselves.  The  use  of  a  shade  lighter  powder,  on  the  other  hand,  is  wise,  for  our  face  skin  invariably  darkens  slightly  because  of  exposure,  and  lightening  it  up  a  little  is  not  going  out  of  Nature's  original  scheme  of  colors.   pATRICIA  ELLIS  offers  a  little  eye  shadow  *-  trick  for  enlarging  the  eyes  which  really  works.

This  month  picture  audiences  are  giving  her  a  "big  hand"  for  her  work  in  "42nd  Street."  Hundreds  of  readers  have  written  in  asking  about  her.   Ruby,  in  private  life,  Mrs.  Al  Jolson,  was  born  in  Halifax,  Nova  Scotia  on  August  25,  1909.  She  is  5  feet,  4  inches  tall;  weighs  105  pounds  and  has  brown  hair  and  blue  eyes.  Her  family  moved  to  New  York  when  she  was  four  years  old.  She  has  three  sisters  and  one  brother.   At  the  ripe  old  age  of  thirteen,  Ruby  made  her  debut  in  the  chorus  of  "The  Rise  of  Rosie  O'Reilly."  Later  she  appeared  in  the  choruses  of  "Sidewalks  of  New  York,"  "Lucky,"  and  "Bye  Bye  Bonnie."  She  first  attracted  Broadway's  attention  when  she  appeared  in  La  Guinan's  nightclub  show.  Her  real  big  opportunity  came  when  the  late  Florenz  Ziegfeld  signed  her  as  chief  tap  dancer  in  "Whoopee."   She  turned  her  back  on  this  opportunity  when  she  married  Al  Jolson.  That  was  in  September,  1928.   Ruby  loves  to  watch  prize-fights,  bicycle  races  and  hockey.  Plays  golf  with  Al  and  accompanies  him  when  he  goes  fishing  at  Catalina.  She  gets  a  great  thrill  out  of  meeting  celebrities  and  collects  autographed  photos  whenever  she  has  the  courage  to  ask  for  one.   United  Artists  offered  her  the  lead  opposite  her  husband  in  "Hallelujah,  I'm  a  Bum,"  but  she  turned  it  down.  Thought  it  would  worry  Al  too  much  to  have  her  working  with  him.  You  will  see  her  next  in  "Gold  Diggers  of  1933."

Don't  blame  the  gloves.  They  are  as  sensitive  as  your  own  skin  to  the  least  bit  of  harshness  in  soap.   Wash  your  gloves  with  soap  you  know  is  PURE— IVORY  SNOW,  the  quick-sudsing  form  of  pure,  gentle  Ivory  Soap.   And  Ivory  Snow  really  dissolves  in  LUKE-  WARM water!  It  is  made  in  a  new  way — not  cut  into  fiat  flakes,  but  blown  into  quick-dissolving,  sudsy  round  bits.   Six  Rules  for  Success  in  Washing  Gloves   1.  Use  IVORY  SNOW  and  just  barely  LUKE-  WARM water.  Hot  water  is  fatal  to  gloves.  Ivory  Snow  melts  instantly  in  water  that  is  safely  cool.   2.  Wash  gloves  INSIDE  as  well  as  OUTSIDE.  A  soft  nail-brush  helps  to  get  finger-ends  clean.   3.  Rinse  thoroughly  inside  and  out  in  barely  LUKEWARM  water.  No  flat  particles  in  Ivory  Snow  to  cling  flat  to  the  leather  and  make  rinsing  difficult — no  soap  spots!   4.  DON'T  SQUEEZE  or  wring  gloves.  Lay  them  flat  between  folds  of  a  Turkish  towel  and  pat  loose  water  out.   5.  DON'T  hang  wash-leather  gloves  to  dry  on  a  hot  radiator  or  over  heat  of  any  kind.   6.  Soften  by  working  onto  your  hands  just  BEFORE  they  are  dry.

Norma  had  none.     I  asked  her  why.   "Because,"  she  said,  "I'm  just  Mrs.  Irving  Thalberg."  And  she  was  too  proud  to  ask  Irving  to  let  her  have  music.   When  they're  at  their  beach  place  Norma  and  Irving  romp  on  the  sands  like  a  couple  of  boys.  Norma  stands  on  her  head  and  does  all  sorts  of  tricks,  but  when  they  come  into  the  house  they  are  both  quite  formal.  They  treat  each  other  with  great  courtesy,  but  it  is  all  very  formal  courtesy.  But  they  never  inter-  fere with  each  other's  jobs  or  lives  and  Norma  resents  it  like  the  very  devil  when  people —  old  friends — expect  her  to  use  her  influence  with  Irving  for  them  at  the  studio.  That's  when  Norma  gets  mad !   TRVING'S  father  and  mother  used  to  live  -'-with  them;  but  since  the  baby  came,  they  live  with  Irving's  sister,  Sylvia,  and  her  husband.  And  now  I  want  to  tell  you  about  Norma   as  a  mother.   Norma  won't  give  out  any  publicity  about    the  baby,  so  very  few  people  know  how  she  treats  it.    And  here's  something  else:   Although  she  relies  on  other  people  who  know  more  about  bringing  up  a  child  than  she  does  and  she  has  never  interfered  with  the  care  of  the  baby,  she  supervises  its  daily  routine.  So  you  women  who  complain  you  can't  find  time  to  reduce,  remember  that  Norma  did  while  she  was  managing  a  job,  a  home  and  a  baby.   She  had  a  trained  nurse  for  the  baby  when  it  was  small,  and  every  day  the  little  fellow  took  his  sun  treatment.  His  day  is  all  mapped  out  and  runs  as  smoothly  as  everything  with  which  Norma  is  connected.   Norma  doesn't  talk  baby  talk  to  the  child.  When  he  was  tiny  she  would  come  into  the  house,  lean  over  his  crib  and  say  exactly  as  if  she  were  talking  to  a  friend,  "Well,  darling,  how  are  you?"  She  is  very  proud  of  him,  but  she  doesn't  make  much  of  a  fuss  over  him.  And  when  you  ask  her  about  him  she  says,  "He's  a  cute  trick."   It's  amazing  to  see  how  Norma  will  take  suggestions — if  she  thinks  they're  good — from    anybody.  One  day  I  happened  to  be  in  her  dressing-room  waiting  for  her,  and  I  picked  up  a  copy  of  "Ex-Wife"  and  began  reading  it.  When  Norma  came  in  I  said,  "Baby,  I've  found  your  next  picture."  I  snowed  her  the  book.   "I  don't  like  'Ex-Wife,'  "  she  said,  but  I  could  see  that  she  was  thinking  about  the  picture  possibilities  in  it;  and  sure  enough  "The  Divorcee,"  based  on  that  book,  was  her  next  picture.   XTORMA  is  too  intelligent  ever  to  be  in  •^-^  danger.  She  is  very  reserved,  and  under-  neath her  friendliness  there  is  restraint.  She  analyzes  everything.  Is  extremely  ambitious  and  not  very  tolerant  of  people  who  aren't.   And  here's  something  I'll  make  a  bet  about.  Norma  will  never  let  her  emotions  run  away  with  her.  She  was  one  of  the  smartest  patients  I  ever  had  and  hasn't  it  been  worthwhile?  Isn't  her  figure  beautiful  now?  Come  on,  you  girls,  who  complain  that  you  can't  reduce.

Also  how  can  I  reduce  my  stomach?  As  I  am  small  (five  feet  one  inch)  and  not  fat,  the  bulge  in  the  back  and  in  the  front  is  rather  incongruous.   F.  F.  J.,  Atlantic  City,  N.  J.   Here's  the  most  wonderful  exercise  for  you  girls  who  sit  all  day.  At  night  (or  morning)  sit  on  the  floor  with  your  legs  stretched  out  in  front  but  not  touching  the  floor.  Then  hitch  yourself  across  the  room  in  the  sitting  position,  using  your  hands  to  help  you  along  as  little  as  possible.  Get  the  idea?  It's  just  walking  in  a  sitting  position.  You  can  honestly  feel  the  fat  cells  being  smashed  off.  You  can  do  the  same  thing  to  take  off  your  stomach,  but  this  time  lie  on  the  floor  face  down  and  with  arms  above  head  roll  from  side  to  side  and  hitch  yourself  along  on  your  stomach.  Put  the  entire  weight  of  your  body  on  your  stomach.  Those  are  two  great  exercises  and  just  what  you  need.    Now,  go  to  it!   Dear  Sylvia:   I  am  about  five  feet  five  tall,  weigh  about  110 — -but  I  think  my  hips  are  too  large — ■  around  36.     What  exercise  is  good?   C.  R.  H.,  Boston,  Mass.   Here's  a  hip  exercise.  Get  down  on  the  floor  on  your  hands  and  knees.  Stretch  one  leg  back  with  the  toe  pointed  straight  back.  Then  drag  that  foot  forward  on  the  toe.  This  will  make  the  hips  rise  in  the  air.  Then  put  your  weight  on  the  foot  you  have  drawn  for-  ward. Repeat  with  the  other  foot.  You  see?  You  are  really  walking  on  your  hands  and  feet.  Go  back  and  forth  across  the  floor  several  times,  but  keep  that  back  toe  pointed  and  feel  the  muscles  of  the  hips  drawing  tight.  Unless  you  can  feel  that,  the  exercise  won't  do  you  any  good.   Dear  Sylvia :   My  nose  is  large  and  wide.     It  spoils  the   84    MY,  how  the  troubles  come  in —  but  don't  think  I  mind.  If  you  knew  what  joy  it  is  to  be  able  to  tell  all  these  worried  girls  how  they  can  set  everything  right  just  by  working  at  home,  you'll  know  why  Aunt  Sylvia  says,  the  more  the  better.  If  you  have  a  problem,  I'll  be  glad  to  help  if  you'll  just  write,  address-  ing your  letter  to  Sylvia,  care  of  PHOTOPLAY  Magazine,  221  West  57th  Street,  New  York  City.  For  a  direct  answer,  enclose  a  self-addressed  stamped  envelope;  otherwise  watch  these  columns.  No  obligations  what-  ever, of  course — I'm  only  too  glad  to  help.   SYLVIA    looks  of  my  face.    What  shall  I  do  to  make  it  smaller?   E.  B.,  Chicago,  111.   That's  easy,  honestly  it  is.  You  can  take  off  flesh  from  the  nose  exactly  as  you  can  off  other  parts  of  the  body.  I've  done  just  that  to  many  of  the  stars.  Here's  what  you  do:  For  a  half  hour  a  day,  with  the  middle  finger  of  each  hand,  begin  at  the  tip  of  the  nose  and  rub  hard  along  the  sides.  Put  some  cold  cream  on  your  fingers.  Then  right  at  the  base  of  the  nose,  massage  in  a  rotary  movement  with  your'  fingers.  Dig  into  the  flesh  you  want  removed.  The  idea  is  to  rub  your  nose  on  the  spots  that  need  taking  off.  Think  of  it  as  so  much  sculptor's  clay.  You're  the  sculptor  and  you  can  model  that  nose!   REGAINING  PEP   Dear  Sylvia :   I  am  only  twenty-five,  married  and  have  two  sons;  but  I  seem  to  have  lost  all  my  pep.  My  face  is  drawn  looking.  Tell  me  what  to  do  to  look    attractive    again.   Mrs.  N.  S.,  New  Rochelle,  N.  Y.   Pep  is  as  much  a  matter  of  mind  as  of  body.  Get  hold  of  yourself.     Walk  with  your  shoul-    ders thrown  back,  your  head  up.  Take  brisk  sure  steps.  Take  a  cool  shower  every  morn-  ing and  rub  your  body  hard  with  a  Turkish  towel,  rubbing  extra  hard  up  and  down  your  spine.  Then  turn  the  radio  on  to  a  peppy  tune  and  dance  around  the  floor.  I  mean  it —  just  dance  around  by  yourself.  Do  a  little  two-step   with   your  arms  about  your  head.   Spring  on  every  step  and  move  your  body  from  side  to  side.  Feel  all  the  muscles  come  into  play.  Get  your  circulation  stirring.  Stir  up  your  lazy  body.  Don't  eat  fried  foods  or  heavy  pastries  or  highly  seasoned  foods.  Drink  plenty  of  tomato  juice  and  eat  lots  of  raw  tomatoes  (that's  marvelous  for  the  com-  plexion). Drink  orange  juice  in  the  morning  and  grapefruit  juice  at  night.  Only  sleep  about  seven  or  eight  hours.  Start  the  day  with  fifteen  minutes  of  brisk  exercise.    Smile.   Yes,  I  mean  it.  Your  face  won't  look  so  drawn  if  you  smile  a  lot.  Take  an  interest  in  everyone  you  meet.  Look  at  yourself  in  the  mirror  every  day  and  tell  yourself  that  you  feel  great.   REDUCING   Dear  Miss  Sylvia:   Would  you  give  me  a  diet  on  which  I  could  take  off  four  or  five  pounds  a  week?   M.  L.  K.,  Logansport,  Ind.   My  general  reducing  routine  will  take  off  fifteen  pounds  a  month.  But  if  there  is  some  vital  reason  why  you  should  have  those  pounds  off  on  a  weekly  basis,  I'll  tell  you  what  you  should  do.  For  three  days  take  nothing  but  liquids — a  glass  every  two  hours.  You  can  have  your  choice  of  liquids — tomato"  juice,  grapefruit  juice  and  orange  juice — but  arrange  it  so  that  the  orange  juice  is  taken  in  the  after-  noon and  the  grapefruit  juice  just  before  you  retire.  Take  a  glass  of  all  three  liquids  during  those  days.  You  can  use  your  own  choice  about  how  to  scatter  them  along.  For  three  days  eat  normally,  avoiding  fattening  foods,  of  course.  Do  this — three  days  liquid  and  three  days  solid,  until  you're  the  weight  you  want.  This  is  a  pretty  drastic  method  and  should  only  be  done  if  there  is  a  vital  reason  for  easing  weight  quickly.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933    85    JUMPY  SERVES   Dear  Sylvia:   I  am  a  victim  of  nerves.  Should  I  follow  tin-  advice  to  Constance  Bennett  given  in  your  article  in  the  February  issue  of  Photoplay?  I  suffer  with  indigestion  on  account  of  nerves.  I  have  constant  fears  that  I  shall  develop  a  disease  and  while  I  tell  myself  I'm  foolish  to  dwell  on  these  thoughts,  I  still  do.   Mrs.  H.  M.  Y.,  Brooklyn,  N.  Y.   By  all  means  follow  the  Constance  Bennett  routine.  I  told  you  that  she  was  very  nervous  when  I  first  took  her.  But  here  are  some  varia-  tions for  your  special  case.  Instead  of  eating  three  mealsa  day— eat  five  meals.  This  will  mean  that  each  meal  will  be  less  than  the  ordinary.  Take  the  same  amount  of  food  that  you  normally  would,  but  scatter  it  out  into  five  meals.  Eat  lots  of  fresh  vegetables  boiled  low  in  water  and  with  the  butter  put  on  cold  after  the  vegetables  are  off  the  fire.   Don't  eat  much  meat.  Drink  plenty  of  tomato  juice  and  fruit  juices.  Don't  eat  rich  pastries  and  pies.  Eat  simple  foods.  Drink  a  glass  of  grapefruit  juice  just  before  going  to  bed  at  night.  I  promise  you — here's  my  hand  on  it — that  if  you  follow  the  Connie  Bennett  routine  with  these  additions  you  will  be  in  very  good  health.   Dear  Madame  Sylvia:   Did  the  movie  stars  who  now  have  such  beautiful  figures  always  have  small  busts  even  though  they  were  once  stout?  I  am  rather  plump,  but  built  proportionately.  I  am  now  following  your  diet  and  would  like  to  know  if  I  can  reduce  my  bust  very  much.   E.  H.,  Staten  Island,  N.  Y.   Plenty  of  movie  stars  were  big  chested.  I  have  a  special  diet  for  reducing  the  bust,  but  if  you're  built  proportionately — your  bust  not  being  too  large  for  the  rest  of  your  body —  you  don't  need  it.  Just  keep  right  on  with  your  diet  and  exercises  and  you'll  lose  weight  all  over.  You're  lucky  that  you  are  in  good  proportion.

Fame.  Why,  he  can  even  marry  a  star!"   Bob  wanted  to  marry.  He  wanted  a  home  and  children.  Being  studious  by  nature,  he  kept  his  eyes  and  ears  wide  open  as  he  was  rushed  into  the  sacred  precincts  of  Hollywood.  He  gave  a  great  deal  of  thought  and  attention  to  actresses.   In  the  course  of  a  few  months  he  was  seen  constantly  with  half  a  dozen  of  the  young  players.  He  was  rumored  engaged  to  Virginia  Bruce,  fresh  from  Eastern  stage  successes,  and  was  attentive  to  Florine  McKinney.  Miss  Bruce  later  married  John  Gilbert.   FINALLY,  becoming  lonesome,  he  made  a  date  with  Betty,  his  high  school  sweetheart,  over  the  telephone.  Betty,  as  has  been  said,  has  no  motion  picture  aspirations,  is  completely  out-  side the  pale  of  motion  pictures,  and  considers  the  keeping  of  a  home  for  Bob  the  best  career  in  the  world.   "Bob  and  I  have  had  a  frank  talk  about  love,  about  Hollywood  women  and  Hollywood  so-  ciety. His  conclusions  are  bound  to  shatter  the  illusions  of  those  who  look  upon  Hollywood  from  afar  as  a  garden  of  romance,  bound  to  dis-  appoint'those  who  thought  of  him  as  walking  through  a  glamorous  paradise.   "Imagine  marrying  an  actress — having  her  arrive  at  home  an  hour  late  because  something  went  wrong  at  the  studio — imagine  taking  her  in  your  arms  and  have  her  whisper,  tenderly —   "  'What  do  you  think,  Bob?  My  picture  grossed  $14,000  this  week  at  Indianapolis!'   "That's  romance  in  a  big  way,  all  right.  And  supposing  you're  a  big  shot,  and  you  marry.  Your  wife  clicks  better  than  you  do.  You  stay  at  home.  Before  you  know  it,  you're  not  Bob  Young  any  more.  You're  Mr.  Lu-  cretia  Lovejoy,  or  whatever  her  name  happens  to  be.    Not  for  mine.   "Hollywood  women  are  always  tired  out.  They  sell  love  and  romance  for  so  much  a  yard  at  the  studios  all  day.  They  look  mighty  glamorous  to  theater  audiences.  Men  think —  'Gee,  if  a  woman  who  could  love  like  that  would  only  fall  for  me!'  Well,  they're  all  wrong.  They'd  find  the  woman  in  question  emotionally  exhausted  from  being  forced  through  love  scenes."   Y\  7HILE  working  in  "Today  We  Live,"  Bob  W  had  an  experience  he  won't  forget.  He  met  a  young  actor  who,  in  turn,  proudly  introduced  him  to  his  beautiful  wife.  The  actor  displayed  her  "as  if  she  were  a  prize  winning  dog  in  a  show."   "After  she  left,"  Bob  said,  "he  and  I  talked  about  marriage.  I  said  I  thought  she  was  very  beautiful,  and  that  tickled  his  vanity.  He  told  me  she  worked  in  pictures.  I  asked  him  if  he  didn't  mind  that.  He  said  he  didn't— in  fact,  he  went  further,  telling  me  that  he  and  his  wife  had  an  arrangement  under  which  neither  ever  '  bothered'  the  other.  It  seemed  that  she  met  a  lot  of  men  in  the  course  of  her  work,  and  she  was  welcome  to  do  as  she  wished,  any  time,  without  explaining  to  her  husband.  He,  in  turn,  came  and  went  as  he  desired  with  any  of  the  women  of  his  acquaintance.   "  'We're  modern,'  he  told  me,  'and  we  have  a  modern  marriage.  Neither  of  us  wants  a  home — neither  of  us  likes  children.'   "I  told  him  that  I  was  pretty  modern  my-  self— but  that  I  never  could  consider  such  an  arrangement.  I  said  that  it  seemed  to  me  to  be  the  outgrowth  of  two  breadwinners  in  the  same  family.   "He  admitted  that  it  was,  and  assured  me  that  the  marriage  would  not  last  more  than  a  year."   This  shocked  Bob.  Bob  not  only  loves  a  home — he  has  always  had  one — but  he  wants    children.  He  looks  upon  marriage  as  a  sacred  and  beautiful  thing.  An  intimate  thing,  shared  by  just  two  people,  away  from  the  world  and  the  publicity  spotlight.  The  idea  of  looking  on  a  marriage  as  lasting  only  a  year  or  two  is  horrible  to  him.  Bob  says  love  is  not  something  you  can  tear  off  a  calendar  and  throw  away.   Bob  was  born  in  Chicago  in  1907.  His  father,  Thomas  E.  Young,  was  a  contractor.  It  was  a  large  family,  and  Bob  got  a  feeling  of  substance  and  permanency,  lacking  in  modern  homes.   The  family  moved  to  Seattle  and  then  to  Los  Angeles  when  Bob  was  ten.  At  Lincoln  High  School,  he  met  Betty  Henderson,  three  years  younger  than  he  was.   "We  had  an  understanding,"  Bob  says.   The  youngsters  found  they  had  a  great  deal  in  common.  Bob  has  a  hard  time  explaining  it.  He  says:   "We  liked  to  do  the  same  things.  We  thought  the  same  way  about  a  lot  of  things.  We  were  good  company."   The  understanding  didn't  mature  into  an  engagement.  Bob  was  graduated,  worked  night  and  day.  He  clerked  in  building  and  loan  associations,  worked  in  banks,  was  a  motion  picture  property  man,  so  that  he  might  appear  with  the  Pasadena  Community  Players.  Betty  went  to  the  University  of  Southern  California.   "We  sort  of  lost  track  of  each  other,"  he  explains.   "  A  FTER  four  years  at  the  Community  Play-  -*»-house,  I  went  on  the  road  with  the  Moroni  Olsen  Players.  I  tried  again  and  again  to  get  into  pictures.  Finally,  an  agent  took  an  interest  in  me  and  I  was  signed  by  Metro.  I  was  a  boy  with  a  dream  come  true.  I'd  been  an  errand  boy,  saving  my  money  to  go  to  picture  shows.  I'd  stood  in  line  with  the  thousands  at  pre-  mieres to  get  just  a  glimpse  of  stars.  And,  abruptly,  I  was  a  motion  picture  actor — a  male  Cinderella.   "I  was  thrown  into  the  heart  of  the  motion  picture  colony.  It  was  like  being  a  millionaire  for  a  day.  How  I  managed  to  keep  both  feet  on  the  ground,  I  don't  know.    But  I  did.   "  I  went  every  place,  saw  everybody.  There  were  parties  and  more  parties.  I  met  stars,  talked  with  them.   "Then,  as  the  months  passed,  I  began  to  see  the  glamour  peel  away  and  get  underneath  Hollywood  life.  I  saw  the  women,  trading  in  sex — getting  so  much  money  for  so  many  emo-  tions per  reel.  I  saw  young  women  who  were  so  wrapped  up  in  their  work  that  they  could  think  of  nothing  save  success.  They  were  cold.  Their  emotions  were  spent.  What  was  more,  I  saw  married  couples  who  both  had  careers.  I  saw  the  terrific  difficulties  under  which  they  stayed  together.   "And,  later,  I  saw  many  part  as  the  result  of  their  problems.   "I  got  to  thinking  how  much  more  real  my  attachment  for  Betty  had  been  than  anything  I  had  seen  in  Hollywood.  One  night  I  made  a  date  with  her.  Here  was  real  companionship,  sincere  devotion."   IT  was  not  until  recently  that  he  felt  he  had  enough  of  a  margin  above  expenses  to  be  able  to  provide  for  a  wife.   "I've  thought  it  over  carefully,"  he  says.  "At  first,  I  was  afraid  to  think  of  marriage.  Supposing  I  was  only  a  flash  in  the  pan  and  couldn't  make  good?  Then,  any  woman  brave  enough  to  have  married  me  would  have  been  left  holding  the  bag."   But  now,  after  two  years  and  eleven  pictures— "The  Black  Camel/'  "The  Guilty  Generation,"  "The  Sin  of  Madelon  Claudet,"  "The  Wet  Parade,''  "New  Mor-  als for  Old,"  "Unashamed,"  "Strange  In-  terlude," "Hell  Below,"  "Men  Must  Fight,"    Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933    "  The  Kid  From  Spain  "  and  "  Today  We  Live  "  ■ — he  has  had  enough  confidence  to  take  the  step.   Betty  was  graduated  from  the  University  of  Southern  California  last  June,  with  honors.  Almost  immediately  thereafter  she  found  a  position.   "None  of  that,"  said  Bob.  "We're  going  to  get  married  too  soon  to  be  bothered.  I'm  lay-  ing down  the  law  right  now,  young  lady.  There'll  be  just  one  fellow  in  this  family  going  after  the  ham  and  eggs,  and  that'll  be  Robert  George  Young."   Bob  says  he'd  feel  the  same  way  about  mar-  riage if  he  was  a  bank  clerk — banking  almost  was  his  career,  you  know — or  working  in  a  shoe  store.   ""Y"OU  can't  have  a  divided  pay-roll  and  still  ■*■  have  a  central  interest,  no  matter  what  work  you  do,"  he  asserts.  "Ii  I  were  making  less  money  than  I  am,  I'd  not  compromise  and  get  married,  even  with  the  understanding  that  my  wife  could  quit  'after  a  while '  when  the  in-  stallments on  the  furniture  were  met.   "I'd  stay  single  until  I  could  support  my  wife  properly."   As  Betty  agrees  with  these  ideas,  it  looks  as  if  Hollywood  is  about  to  have  another  non-  professional marriage  which  will  be  a  success.  Statistics  show  that  actors  who  marry  non-  professional wives  have  five  times  a  greater  chance  at  happiness  than  those  who  marry  actresses.    Acme    Well,  now,  Tom,  life's  treating  you  easily,  if  you  can  look  so  hearty  and  so  happy,  as  you  take  your  ease  at  Miami.  And  vacation  can't  dim  the  Meighan  fire,  would  you  say,  girls?    Caution:  To  save  lovely  teeth — fight  film    FILM  . .  .  what  is  it?  A  soft,  sticky  mass  that  stains  teeth  an  ugly  yellow.  Food  par-  ticles cling  to  it.  The  mineral  salts  in  saliva  combine  with  film  and  form  hard,  irritating  tartar  that  makes  gums  bleed.   Film's  greatest  damage  is  done  through  tooth  decay.  In  film  are  tiny,  rod -shaped  germs . . .  Lactobacilli.  These  germs  produce  strong  acid.  This  acid  eats  away  the  tooth  enamel  just  as  other  acids  eat  into  cloth  or  wood.  Deeper  and  deeper  goes  the  acid  until  the  nerve  is  reached  .  .  .  the  root  canal  infected . . .  and  unless  repaired,  results  may  well  prove  tragic.   "What  can  I  do  to  fight  decay?"   To  fight  film  use  Pepsodent  instead  of  ordi-  nary tooth  pastes.  Why?  Because  Pepsodent  contains  a  special  film -removing  substance  that  is  one  of  the  great  discoveries  of  the  day.  Its  power  to  remove  every  trace  of  film-  stain  is  revolutionary!  Its  notable  distinction  of  being  twice  as  soft  as  other  materials  in  common  use  has  gained  wide  recognition.

Use  Pepsodent  twice  a  day  and  see  your  dentist  at  least  twice  every  year.    See  how  rapidly  film  forms  on  teeth    These  teeth  were  absolutely  free  of  film  at  8  a.  m.

Going  riding  through  the  mountains  in  the  nuttiest  little  sled  that  looks  like  a  baby  cradle.  Rosie,  Vilma,  Mrs.  Eddie  Goulding  (she  came  up  the  other  day)  and  me.  Rex  begged  to  come  along  toe- — but  I  wouldn't  let  him.  I  think  sometimes  a  wife  and  husband  should  be  apart.  At  least  for  a  few  hours  a  day.  Then  they  don't  run  so  much  chance  of  getting  on  each  other's  nerves.  Which  Rex  and  I  have  never  done  so  far  yet.    (Knock  on  wood.)   Jan.  28th.  If  you're  looking  for  celebrities,  just  come  to  St.  Moritz.  They're  lumped  to-  gether here  like  pieces  of  molasses  candy.  All  sorts.  Princes  and  dukes  and  counts  and  mar-  quises (is  that  the  way  to  spell  it?)  and  barons.  Common  as  extras  in  Hollywood.  Manufac-  turers, and  retired  millionaires — if  there  are  such  people  left  in  the  world.   A  terribly  sweet  boy  who's  head  of  an  im-  portant company  in  America  is  here,  and  he's  been  with  us  practically  every  day.  Is  going  down  to  the  South  of  France  with  us,  too.  Expects  to  sail  on  the  Rex  from  Italy  with  us  when  we  return  to  America.  There  are  lots  of  actors  and  movie  people  and  explorers  and  mountain  climbers  and  champion  sportsmen  here,  too.   And  some  famous  aviators . . .   Jan.  30th.  A  terrible  thing  happened  yester-  day. There's  an  English  aviator  here — I  forget  his  name,  but  he's  terribly  well-known.  The  other  day  he  asked  Rex  and  me  to  take  a  short  flight  over  the  Alps  with  him  and  his  pal,  another  Englishman.  I've  been  leery  of  planes  ever  since  I  was  in  a  smash-up  flying  back  to  Los  Angeles  from  Mexico  with  Harry  Richman.  My  face  was  all  cut  up,  and  I  felt  dreadful  and  looked  worse.  So  I  wouldn't  allow  Rex  to  go  either.  I'm  superstitious  about  flying  now.  So  the  Englishman  didn't  go  either,  but  stayed  and  went  tobogganing  with  us.  His  friend  went  by  himself,  and  was  killed.  Nobody  can  say  I  haven't  got  hunches.  Besides,  I  believe  in  the  law  of  gravity.   What  I  always  say  is:  What  goes  up  must  come  down.   Jan.  31st.  Last  night  was  loads  of  fun.  We  had  an  auction  sale  for  the  benefit  of  the  bob  run.  And  they  auctioned  off  a  picture  of  my-  self. Prince  de  Bourbon — he  comes  from  a  very  old  famous  French  family,  I  think  it  has  some-  thing to  do  with  Napoleon;  maybe  he  was  against  Napoleon,  I've  forgotten — .   Anyway,  he's  a  charming  man,  and  he  kept  on  making  them  raise  the  bid  for  that  picture  of  me.  I  was  surprised  when  it  kept  getting  higher  and  higher.  Princes  and  counts  and  dukes  were  bidding  against  one  another  for  my  picture.  Made  me  feel  kind  of  important.  It  sold  finally  to  Count  Rossi,  an  awfully  nice  gentleman,  for  five  hundred  bucks  .  .  .  Golly,  was  I  the  hit  of  the  evening  after  that!  We  danced  and  played  roulette  till  all  hours.   Believe  me,  this  is  the  life.  Outdoors  all  day,  with  the  wind  and  the  sun  making  your  blood  tingle  in  your  veins.  Developing  a  gosh-  awful  appetite,  exercising  till  you're  ready  to  drop.  Skating,  skiing,  tobogganing,  sleighing.  Then  good  talks  in  front  of  the  blazing  log  fire.  It  feels  so  good  to  relax  that  way,  after  you've  been  out  all  day  in  the  air.  Then  a  dinner  that  would  knock  your  eye  out,  it's  so  good.   And  in  the  evening — dancing  and  bridge  and  roulette  and  all  the  kind  of  gambling  games  they  make  so  much  fuss  over  in  Monte  Carlo.  I  wish  I  didn't  have  to  leave.  .  .  .  And  the  one  thing  I  love  about  it  here  and  about  all  of  Europe  I've  seen  so  far  is  the  freedom.  Nobody  asking  any  questions.  Everybody  minding  his  own  business.    They  don't  give  a  darn  what  you  do  over  here.   That's  the  only  way  to  live.   Feb.  2nd.  There's  an  awfully  nice  man  here  called  Count  Vallombrosa,  who  joins  us  for  roulette  quite  often.  He  was  in  Paris  also  when  we  were  there — and  when  he  left  he  gave  Rex  and  me  a  letter  to  his  friend,  the  Count  de  Polignac,  who  lives  in  Paris  part  of  the  time.  The  rest  of  the  time  this  Count  and  his  Mar-  quis brother  (I  can't  keep  these  darn  titles  straight)  live  in  Reims.  They  have  a  castle  there.  They  own  the  largest  champagne  cellars  in  the  world.  They  make  Pomeroy  Greno  champagne.  They  say  that's  the  most  famous  brand  in  the  world.  Only  we  didn't  get  much  of  that  in  America,  even  before  Prohibition.  Maybe  it  was  too  expensive.  All  I  can  remem-  ber is  Mumm's.   Anyway,  we  met  the  Count.  Because  I  wanted  to  visit  Reims  and  the  battlefields.  I  wanted  to  find  out  what  the  war  was  like,  and  I  wanted  to  see  that  famous  cathedral  the  Germans  bombed.   So  we  visited  Reims  and  tested  some  of  the  swellest  champagne  I  ever  hope  to  get  in  my  young  life.   And  the  warfields  were  just  like  they'd  been  left  on  Armistice  day.  I  think  the  war  must  have  been  worse  than  we  thought.  If  I  have  time  later  I'm  going  to  write  it  up  in  this  diary.  Because  I  think  seeing  those  things  made  a  deeper  impression  on  me  than  anything  else  I  saw  or  did  in  Europe.  I  hope  I  can  write  it  up  the  way  I  saw  it.   Feb.  3rd.  My  skiing  has  improved  like  no-  body's business.  The  teacher  says  if  I  could  take  a  lesson  from  him  every  day  for  the  next  month,  he'd  make  me  like  a  professional.  I  could  even  enter  the  Olympics  for  women.  He  says  even  though  I  haven't  done  much  athletics — only  riding  and  swimming — I've  got  the  build  for  it.  And  he  says  I've  got  remark-  able courage  for  a  woman.  And  lots  of  energy,  more  than  most  other  women.  I  don't  see  any-  thing very  wonderful  about  that.  I'm  just  not  afraid  of  many  things,  except  aeroplanes,  and  talking  before  an  audience.  I  guess  I've  been  around  animals  so  much,  I've  lost  my  fear.  Animals  don't  have  half  the  physical  fear  humans  have.   We  could  learn  a  lot  from  them.   There's  a  great  old  St.  Bernard  up  here.  He  follows  me  everywhere.  I'll  say  I'm  going  to  be  lonely  for  him!  I  would  have  taken  him  back  with  me,  but  it's  hard  to  get  imported  dogs  through  the  American  immigration.  Sukie,  the  kangaroo,  wants  to  come  along  with  me,  too.  But  maybe  she  and  Pinkie  (Clara's  pet  white  rat)  wouldn't  get  along  so  well  together.  And  I  don't  think  she'd  like  the  monkeys  or  the  dogs  at  the  ranch.  So  Sukie  stays  in  St.  Moritz.   Feb.  4th.  Gee,  I  hate  to  leave.  But  Mr.  Bavetta,  the  French  representative  for  Fox  studios  who  managed  my  itinerary  fn  France  and  Switzerland  after  Sam  Rork  re-  turned to  America,  has  been  wiring  us  franti-  cally from  Paris  to  say  if  we  want  to  spend  a  little  time  in  the  South  of  France  before  sailing  for  New  York,  we've  got  to  leave  St.  Moritz  now.  I'm  anxious  to  see  the  Riviera.  Want  to  find  out  if  it  really  beats  Southern  California  for  climate  and  scenery  and  good  times.  I  don't  see  how  that's  possible,  but  I'm  willing  to  be  convinced.   We  expect  to  stay  in  Monte  Carlo  as  long  as  possible,  and  maybe  have  a  day  or  two  at  Nice,  Cannes  and  Juan  les  Pins  (I  always  have  to  look  up  the  spelling  of  these  foreign  places  in  our  Baedecker).  Lilian  Harvey  and  Maurice  Chevalier  both  have  villas  down  there.  We  hope  we'll  have  a  chance  to  see  them — the  houses  I  mean.    Because  both  Lilian  (she  was    Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933    in  our  New  Year's  Eve  party  in  Berlin)  and  Maurice  are  in  Hollywood  now.   I  don't  see  how  the  Riviera  could  beat  St.  Moritz.  Nothing  could  for  me.  And  every-  body's been  so  grand  here.  They're  all  begging  us  to  stay.  But  we're  leaving  tomorrow  prob-  ably, after  the  most  marvelous  two  weeks  I've  ever  spent  in  my  life.  ...  So  here  goes  for  some  packing.  ...  So  long,  St.  Moritz!  I'll  be  seeing  you  again!   Next  month  Clara  will  tell  you  of  her  experiences  in  the  gay  city  of  Paris  and  on  the  battlefields  of  Flanders    A  Millionaire  in  Search  of  Happiness   [  CONTINUED  FROil  PAGE  35  ]    You  have  never  seen  that  tramp  achieve  his  heart's  desire  in  any  of  his  pictures.   That's  because  the  millionaire  has  never  achieved  his  heart's  desire  in  real  life.   To  have  the  tramp  do  so  in  the  picture  would  be  to  reach  an  anti-climax  on  the  screen.  To  satisfy  the  lone  figure  in  life  would  be  to  quench  the  fire  of  genius  from  which  the  brilliancy  of  creativeness  constantly  gleams.   SO  he  remains  the  contradictory  comic  who  solaces  the  loneliness  in  his  soul  with  ram-  bling improvisations  worthy  of  a  Wagner  or  a  Beethoven,  and  then  invites  Einstein  to  his  home  and  clowns  him  into  hysterics.  He  came  from  the  common  people,  but  he  dines  with  the  Prince  of  Wales  and  instinctively  picks  up  the  proper  fork.   He  wanders  in  and  out  of  night  clubs,  sitting  always  at  a  table  alone.  He  is  a  de-  tached being,  even  in  the  melee  of  merriment  at  the  Cocoanut  Grove.   He  is  appalled  at  the  suffering  of  others —  he  has  great  pity  for  those  who  have  to  with-  stand the  ravages  of  poverty,  disappointment,  defeat.  Yet  within  himself  his  sensitive,  never-  to-be-satisfied  soul  suffers  more  than  any  of  those  he  pities.   He  is  a  near-divinity  who  communes  with  the  gods  of  art  while  he  feasts  with  gastronomic  delight  on  a  dish  of  stewed  tripe.   Many  times  this  prince  of  inconsistencies,  this  most  complex  being  of  idiosyncrasies,  has  attempted  to  capture  happiness  in  his  grasp.  Many  women  have  loved  him,  and  he  has  thought  himself  in  love  with  many  women.   But  no  woman  who  has  loved  him  could  offer  the  tenth  part  of  what  he  had  to  give —  not  one  of  them  could  follow  his  moods,  com-  mune with  his  thoughts,  share  with  him  the  mental  world  he  occupied.   To  him  none  of  them  could  be  companion.  He  found  that  he  must  walk  alone  in  his  own  chosen  paths  even  while  he  lived  with  them.   "TMSAPPOINTED  once,  he  tried  again.  Dis-  *— ^appointed  again,  he  tried  yet  another  time.  Even  in  woman  he  sought  something  which  he  could  not  find.  Yet  he  must  keep  on  eternally  trying,  because  he  was  lonely  deep  down  in-  side of  him.  But  there  was  no  kindred  soul  that  he  could  discover;  always  there  was  some-  thing lacking.  The  woman  who  could  under-  stand his  whims  would  have  had  to  be  a  clair-  voyant, and  she  who  could  change  her  own  mood  to  match  his  would  have  needed  to  be  a  genius,  also.   And  there  were  none  such,  it  seemed.   He  tries  to  formulate  her  now  on  the  key-  board of  that  organ,  from  the  tremolo  strings  of  that  violin.  There  is  a  place  waiting  for  her  in  the  mansion  where  he  now  lives  alone — and  it  is  really  alone — with  his  five  servants.   One  woman  was  mirrored  in  all  of  his  early  films,  and  Hollywood,  at  least,  believes  that  she  was  the  only  woman  who  brought  "him    89    AN  AMAZING  OFFER!

THOUSANDS  roar  farewell— the  42nd  Street  Special,  most  sensational  train  in  railroad  history,  pulls  out  of  Los  Angeles  with  its  cargo  of  picture  stars  on  a  cross  country  trip  of  good-will.  The  train  is  ablaze  with  light —  huge  signs  on  both  sides  run  its  full  length.  In  those  signs  are  more  than  3500  lamps — unpro-  tected— every  one  of  them  bearing  the  honorable  mark  (M).  Giant  searchlights  sweep  the  sky  as  this  spectacular  comet  of  the  rails  heads  east  for  the  mountains  and  beyond.  The  grind  has  begun.  Many  stops  to  make — which  means  speed  to  keep  with  the  schedule,  60,  even  70  and  more  miles  an  hour  sometimes.  The  train  lurches  and  jars — terrific  strain — the  lamps  in  the  signs  outside  are  taking  a  beating  from  the  ripping  winds  and  penetrating  moisture;  dust  hammers  against  them — the  temperature  goes  down  .  .  .  they're  getting  the  bitterest  test  any  lamps  on  earth  could  possibly  get!   Yet  in  Chicago — after  3098  miles  of  moun-  tains and  deserts  and  plains  and  wind  and  cold  — only  eleven  of  them  weren't  burning!  Of  these,  five  had  been  taken  as  souvenirs  by  fans,  three  had  been  shattered  by  pebbles  kicked  up  by  the  rush,  and  only  three  had  burned  out!  Think  of  it — every  one  of  the  more  than  3500  unprotected  lamps  suffered  more  torture  than  you'd  give  a  lamp  in  your  home  in  years.   This  amazing  story  of  lamp  quality  is  of  real  dollars-and-cents  significance  to  you.  It  means  that  lamps  bearing  the  trustworthy  monogram  ra|)  can  take  it!  It  means  they  won't  die  young,  blacken  too  soon  or  otherwise  disappoint  you.  And  they  don't  squander  current — they  make  electricity  an  even  more  economical  servant.

And  he  is  still  grateful  to  her,  even  though  other  women  succeeded  her  as  his  moods  changed.   His  pictures  are  largely  a  diary  of  his  loves,  written  like  milestones  upon  his  road  of  life.  Some  of  them  have  exploited  him,  some  have  brought  him  a  brief  taste  of  delight;  in  the  end,  all  of  them  have  failed  him  because  they  were  not  of  the  same  caliber  as  he.   "He's  a  glutton  for  punishment,"  says  Hollywood.   "DUT  Hollywood  is  wrong.  The  punishment  ■'-'is  incidental,  perhaps  unavoidable,  while  the  pilgrim  pursues.  And  he  is  compelled  to  keep  on  pursuing  by  the  desire  within  him.  He  is  driven — driven  to  all  those  long,  lonely  walks,  driven  to  his  music,  to  his  pictures,  even,  by  the  compelling  urge  to  seek  everlastingly  with  the  hope  that  he  shall  find.    He  is  a  Gulliver  in  a  land  of  Lilliputians,  an  artistic  oak  in  a  forest  of  saplings.  Therefore,  with  the  multitudes  around  him,  admiring  and  acclaiming  him,  he  is  alone.   TWHEN  he  is  making  a  film  and  comes  to  a  w  temporary  impasse,  he  asks  all  his  staff  to  leave  him,  to  stay  away  from  him,  until  he  shall  have  thought  his  way  out  by  himself.  They  are  powerless  to  help  him,  because  he  alone  knows,  he  alone  has  the  God-given  in-  stinct, to  go  on.   A  great  soul  is  a  lonely  soul.  Others  can-  not commune  with  him.   It  was  a  fitting  gesture  of  fate  to  mask  such  a  soul  with  the  body  of  a  buffoon.   His  buffoonery  has  made  him  many  times  a  millionaire.  He  gives  happiness  to  all  the  world.  But  not  all  his  millions  can  buy  him  happiness.

(I  smiled  at  the  emphasis  Clark  put  upon  the  big.  Eight  dollars  was  still  a  mag-  nificent sum  to  this  man  making  thousands  weekly.  Which  explains  why  Helen  Hayes  calls  him  'completely  unspoiled!')   "I  wrote  that  letter  from  a  lumber  camp.  I  was  overworking.  My  health  broke.  .  .  .  There  were  doctor  bills.  I  wired  father  for  help.     There  was  no  answer!   ''Today  I  can  understand  dad's  attitude.  It  was  his  way  of  forcing  me  to  come  home  to  him;  to  make  me  see  that  what  he  wanted  for  his  only  son  was  for  the  best.  I  didn't  see  it  then.  I  only  became  more  bitter.  And  he  became  more  disappointed.   "I  thought  my  father  cruel.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  he  was  actually  kind.  His  stubbornness  increased  my  stubbornness  to  stick  to  my  dream  of  the  stage.  He  tied  me  to  my  star  more  firmly  than  ever.  In  fact,  I  hated  then.  Youth  is  always  so  extravagant  in  its  emotions.   "Now,  I  am  grateful  to  him.  Mature  man  seems  capable  of  looking  at  both  sides  of  a  question  whereas  youth  sees  only  one.  The  ego,  so  necessary  to  the  boy,  mellows  to  a  more  objective  tolerance  in  the  man.   "T  EVEN  hated  my  fellow  workers  in  those  *~  days.  When  I  did  get  theatrical  engage-  ments, other  actors  advised  me  to  give  up.  They  swore  I  couldn't  make  the  grade.  They  said  my  father  was  right;  advised  me  to  return  home  to  safety.  They  insisted  I  lacked  every  qualifica-  tion for  acting.  My  ego  hated  them;  my  stub-  bornness rebelled  and  in  rebellion  strengthened  my  determination.   "Today,  I  do  not  hate.  I  appreciate.  I  real-  ize that  I  was  serving  my  apprenticeship;  going  through  my  college  education.  Suppose  a  boy  is  studying  law  or  medicine  and  his  professor  advises  him  to  choose  another  profession.  He  says,  '  You  are  not  fitted  for  this.  You  will  not  succeed.  Change  before  it  is  too  late.  That  young  man  changes  if  he  is  weak;  persists,  if  he  is  strong.  And  fights  his  unfitness  until  he  overcomes  it.   "Those  other  actors  took  the  place  of  in-  structors. My  father  was  the  professor.  All  youth  must  go  through  college,  whether  in  an  institution  or  not.   "My  father  seemed  to  be  proved  right  for    many  long  years.  I  made  no  money;  I  got  nowhere.  I  was  just  one  more  failure!  Some  boys  are  forced  to  remain  in  college  longer  than  others.   "Then,  out  of  the  blue,  came  the  'lucky'  break — the  law  of  averages.   "When  father  accidentally  saw  my  name  in  a  review  of  '  Machinal '  in  a  New  York  news-  paper which  somehow  reached  his  hands,  he  wrote  me  in  care  of  the  Equity  Association.  It  was  a  note  of  congratulations — with  no  return  address.   "  I  could  not  find  him.  I  tried  to  avoid  talk-  ing about  it  in  Hollywood  until  after  I  had  located  and  talked  with  him.  I  didn't  know  how  he  felt,  and  I  certainly  didn't  want  him  to  hear  from  me  through  a  discussion  of  our  separation  in  the  newspaper  columns.   ""RINALLY,  I  found  him  on  a  farm  in  North   *■  Dakota.  He  had  not  struck  his  well,  but  he  had  saved  enough  to  return  to  the  work  from  which  he  made  his  stalwart  beginning.   "It  took  another  year  and  numerous  letters  to  get  him  to  come  down  here.  I  had  thought  I  would  never  talk  about  him  for  publication.  I  have  refused  again  and  again,  but — ."   The  fact  that  Clark's  father  is  now  living  in  a  small  home  not  far  from  his  son's  big  one,  is  only  proof  that  the  wilfulness  and  impulsive-  ness of  youth  turn  to  tolerance  at  maturity.  That  the  obdurate  protectiveness  of  parent-  hood can  be  converted  into  a  deeper  under-  standing of  the  needs  of  an  offspring  who  is  different  from  one's  self,  when  maturity  turns  to  kinder  middle  age.   The  added  fact  that  his  father  is  a  bridegroom  (having  recently  married  his  brother's  widow  — Clark's  aunt)  demonstrates  also  that  a  father  and  son  can  agree  that  it  is  quite  natural  for  a  single  man  and  woman  in  their  sunset-  years  to  give  a  personal  meaning  to  what  youth  terms  "love,"  and  maturity  terms  "com-  panionship."   Watching  Mr.  Gable,  Sr.,  and  the  new  mother-in-law  dining  each  Sunday  with  Clark  and  Ria  Gable — who  could  guess  the  gigantic  struggle,  the  bitterness,  the  disappointment  and  sorrow  which  once  separated  father  and  son?  ,   Clark  relaxed,  smiled.  "My  father  thought  I  was  not  sincere.  If  I  should  ever  give  a  really  inspired  performance  on  stage  or  screen,  it  will  be  because  I  have  always  been  so  sincere  that  my  sincerity  reflects  in  that  performance.   "  Dad  thought  I  was  taking  the  gamble.  He  thought  the  stage  unstable.  He  couldn't  realize  that  saving  money  to  invest  in  a  wildcat  oil  well  is  the  biggest  gamble  in  the  world.  It's  too  bad  that  only  hardship  can  mellow  people  to  understand  the  other  fellow's  view-  point.   But  I  guess  talking  doesn't  help.    We    all  have  to  suffer  through  our  college  educa-  tions on  our  own.   "I  don't  suppose  anyone  can  ever  change  human  nature.  I  don't  suppose  this  story  can  help.  But  if  boys  and  girls  would  only  decide  what  they  want  to  be,  and  then  want  to  be  that  more  than  anything  else  in  the  world!  It  doesn't  matter  how  humble  the  choice.  If  you  make  up  your  mind  to  be  the  best  shoemaker  and  work  at  that  without  once  side-stepping,  you're  bound  to  feel  you  have  accomplished  some-  thing in  life!"    Tm  Right,  You're  Wrong"   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  45  J   "He  discovered  that  the  aunt  was  an  old  beau  in  New  York  for  one  evening.  She  hadn't  seen  him  for  years.  My  friend  saw  that  girl  only  once  after  that — to  tell  Jier  what  he  thought!   "Do  you  know  that  this  was  years  ago,  but  that  girl  still  writes  to  him?  He  wastepaper-  baskets  her  letters.   "T  WATCHED  another  couple  for  two  years.  -*■  She  was  the  boss.  He  did  as  she  dictated  and  they  were  both  miserable.  She  kept  threat-  ening divorce.  One  day  he  up  and  knocked  her  in  the  jaw.  She  hasn't  peeped  about  the  di-  vorce since  and  they  are  actually  happy."   It  is  a  theory  of  our  modern  era  that  the  so-  called  gangsters'  molls  are  the  most  loyal  sweethearts  and  wives.  I  had  always  sus-  pected this  might  be  partially  due  to  fear.  Jack  scoffs  at  that  idea.  "Fear  never  bred  anything  fine,  so  it  couldn't  breed  loyalty,  which  is  one  of  our  finest  emotions.  It's  re-  spect. A  gangster  won't  stand  nonsense  from  his  woman.  He  bosses  her  and  she  loves  it.  She  admires  him  if  he  beats  her.  A  woman  who  gets  what  she  deserves  is  always  loyal  to  the  man  who  gives  it  to  her!   "But  so  few  of  us  have  the  nerve  to  do  that.  And  women  have  been  so  trained,  especially  in  this  country,  to  the  ideas  of  gallantry,  hat-  tipping,  rising-in-the-street  car,  that  many  of  them  won't  admit  they  like  a  little  brute  force  when  they  do  get  it.  Their  dignity  or  pride  forces  them  to  the  divorce  courts.  They'd  rather  be  miserable  the  rest  of  their  lives  than  admit  enjoyment  of  what  civilization  and  edu-  cation is  supposed  to  have  cured  in  them.   "But  they  don't  have  to  admit  anything  when  they  thrill  in  the  darkness  of  a  motion  picture  house  to  vicarious  man-handling.  It  doesn't  injure  their  dignity  or  their  pride,  or  their  refinement.    No  one  knows!   "When  they  handed  me  the  script,  I  read  it  with  just  one  question  in  my  mind:  'Will  I  commit  screen  suicide  if  I  play  it?'   "When  I  finished,  I  thought:  'No,  it  isn't  suicide,  and  it  may  give  me  a  new  break.  This  is  the  hardest  guy  ever  pictured.  He  is  so  hard  he  can  never  be  topped.  The  women  won't  approve,  but  they  will  go  to  see  him.'"   TXTHILE  George  Raft  said,  "No  woman  ** would  ever  want  to  see  me  in  any  other  role  if  I  play  it.  They'd  always  remember  me  as  Trigger  and  hate  me  for  it!"   I  am  not  taking  sides — but  I  wonder  if  George  Raft  is  not  remembered  more  for  Ri-  naldo  in  "Scarface,"  than  for  any  other  role  he  has  played — and  Gable  for  "Night  Nurse,"  "A  Free  Soul"  and  "Possessed."   George  and  Clark  showed  the  world  their  cold  steel  first — then  admitted  to  tender  mo-  ments. The  same  with  Jimmy  Cagney.  The  grapefruit  he  plunged  into  Mae  Clarke's  eye  in  "Public  Enemy"  made  him  famous.   Jack  LaRue  is  willing  to  show  cold  steel  as  none  of  these  has  shown  it.  But,  when  he  does  it,  he's  betting  on  women.  A  dangerous  habit.     George  Raft  prefers  horses.

X  TOW  is  your  chance  to  do  a  good  stroke  for  -t  Mhe  picture  that  gave  you  most  pleasure —  the  kind  of  picture  you'd  most  like  to  see  more  of — that  was  released  in  1932 !  You  can  do  it  by  voting  for  that  picture  to  receive  Photoplay's  famous  Gold  Medal,  awarded  the  best  picture  each  year.   Other  fields  have  their  Nobel  prizes,  their  Pulitzer  awards.  But  in  cinemaland,  Photo-  play's Gold  Meda!  is  the  ultimate,  the  highest,  in  distinction.  It  is  made  of  solid  gold,  weigh-  ing 123]^2  pennyweights,  from  the  design  by  Tiffany  and  Company,  New  York — and  it  is  the  supreme  earmark  of  distinction,  for  it  is  the  honor  which  you  and  the  millions  of  your  fellow  picture-goers  award  by  your  votes.   Nor  do  you  merely  honor  a  great  picture  when  you  vote  in  this  contest.  A  great  national  referendum  such  as  this  carries  weight  every-  where— points  unerringly  to  the  sort  of  picture  the  public  will  support  most  generously.  So  casting  your  vote  for  your  selection  adds  just  that  much  to  the  incentive  producers  and  studios  will  feel  to  give  you  more  like  it.   No  rules,  no  limitations,  restrict  you.  Out-  standing work  by  one  or  more  stars  naturally  will  count,  and  count  heavily.  But  you  will  remember  the  supporting  players — the  direc-    tion— settings  and  staging — and  of  course  the  merits  of  the  story  itself.  And  the  best  test,  the  one  which  no  doubt  will  decide  you  in  the  end,  is  the  one  of  which  picture  wears  best  with  you,  as  you  look  back  to  it,  and  compare  it  with  others  of  the  year,  and  with  those  you  are  see-  ing now.  The  picture  that  stands  out  best  is  the  one  for  which  you  will  vote.   To  aid  you  in  recollecting  which  were  the  pictures  of  1932,  we  print  a  list  below;  but  your  choice  is  not  limited  to  those  in  this  list.  If  you  consider  some  other  picture  superior,  and  it  was  released  in  1932,  you  are  perfectly  free  to  vote  for  it.   One  other  point :  While  the  picture  must  be  one  released  in  1932,  you  need  not  have  seen  it  in  that  year.  If  you  saw  it  this  year,  that  is  quite  all  right.   If  the  picture  was  reviewed  in  January  1933,  or  earlier,  it  was  certainly  a  1932  release.   For  your  convenience,  a  voting  coupon  is  printed  herewith,  but  a  letter  or  postcard  will  do  as  well.  Your  vote  is  what  counts,  however  you  send  it.   Remember,  nothing  counts  but  your  votes —  but  in  order  to  count,  your  vote  must  be  at  hand  when  the  polls  close.

Raymond  Hatton,  Fuzzy  Knight,  Fred  Kohler  and  John  Lodge  complete  the  cast.  Good  fun  for  Western  addicts,  and  others  too.

Dickie  Moore,  although  pleasing  in  his  childish  appeal,  is  hopelessly  miscast  as  Oliver.  Alec  B.

"I  Couldn't  Stay  Ina  Claire"    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  51  ]    By  merely  crossing  the  mountains  on  my  way  East.  Hollywood  immediately  receded  to  its  proper  proportions,  my  standards  began  to  re-  organize themselves.  It  was  amazing.  That  episode  now  is  a  half  forgotten  patch  on  my  life."   I  was  tempted  to  ask  Miss  Claire  directly  about  ex-husband  Jack  Gilbert.  But — in  time  — I  recalled  her  remark  about  being  shanty  Irish.    Why  take  the  chance?   "Do  you  want  to  know  why  I  failed  in  pictures?"  asked  Miss  Claire.   "I  failed,"  said  the  actress,  "but  not  by  such  a  big  margin,  at  that.  I  am  not  saying  these  things,  by  the  way,  as  an  enemy  of  motion  pictures.     I  like  them.   "And  pictures  are  not  to  blame  for  the  con-  ditions surrounding  them.   "Acting  to  me  is  a  very  exact  science.  First  I  was  a  dancer.  I  learned  the  technique  of  movement,  that,  to  be  expert,  you  must  train  every  muscle  and  study  continuously.  Every  day  now  I  exercise  and  take  instructions  in  the  handling  of  my  speaking  voice.    I  spend  hours    preparing  for  my  hour  and  a  half  on  the  stage.  You  know,  you  only  get  spontaneity  through  hard  work.   "When  I  take  a  role  on  the  stage  I  first  study  the  drama  thoroughly.  I  consider  and  analyze  the  character  alone,  impartially.  Then  I  take  that  character  and  consider  it  in  terms  of  myself.   "I  think  out  why  this  woman  does  this  and  that,  and  then  picture  all  the  varying  moods  and  emotions  in  terms  of  myself.   "You  cannot  do  that  in  motion  pictures.  You  do  scenes  here  and  there,  with  no  con-  tinuity or  orderly  system.  Frequently,  the  picture  story  is  in  the  throes  of  changes  while  you  are  making  it.  You  start  a  big  scene.  Now  I  must  know  what  it  leads  from  and  to,  in  order  to  depict  it  at  all.  'We  haven't  time,'  is  the  studio  protest  to  that.  'Just  go  ahead  and  be  yourself,'  they  tell  you.   "That  doesn't  help  me.  I  have  no  indi-  vidual personality.  I  am  just  a  fluid  waiting  to  be  pressed  into  the  boundaries  of  an  author's  character.     So  you  see  that  screen    Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933    work  is  torture  for  me  and  that  it  makes  me  profoundly  unhappy.   "Mr.  Goldwyn,  who  presented  me  in  'The  Greeks  Had  a  Word  For  Them,'  told  me  I  talked  too  much  on  the  set.  That  was  be-  cause I  wanted  to  know  about  my  scenes  and  what  they  meant  to  the  story.  'Just  act,  Miss  Claire,'  he  told  me,  'that's  all  we  want.'   "I  do  not  know  why  I  made  'The  Greeks  Had  a  Word  For  Them,'  anyway.  Any  chorus  girl  could  have  played  my  role.  Maybe  I  didn't  get  a  chance  to  protest.  Mr.  Goldwyn  talked  so  fast  and  so  enthusiastically  that  I  had  no  opening.  'You  will  wear  Chanel  gowns,'  he  exclaimed.  'Think  of  that!'  I  did  not  have  the  heart  to  tell  him  that  I  had  worn  dozens  of  them  on  the  stage.  I  hated  to  destroy  his  enthusiasm.   "TN  the  talkies,  cameras  shoot  at  you  from  -*-every  side.  Usually  three  face  every  one  of  your  scenes  from  various  angles.  To  me  that  is  paralyzing,  because  I  work  out  my  scenes  in  such  detail  that  every  move,  the  very  spot  you  stand,  the  tiniest  facial  flicker,  is  exactly  calculated  to  get  the  most  out  of  that  par-  ticular moment.  You  simply  cannot  act  a  scene  in  three  different  directions  to  three  different  cameras.  For  at  least  two  of  them  the  acting  is  obscure,  if  not  lost.   "To  me  or  anyone  like  me,  present  screen  methods  are  impossible.  To  succeed  in  pictures  you  must  have  a  pleasant  appearance  and  a  superficial  pliability,  an  easy  way  of  slipping  into  easy  poses  indicating  easy  motions.  I  cannot  fake  emotions.    I  must  feel  them.   "Also,  you  must  have  luck  if  you  come  from  Broadway.  You  never  get  a  second  chance.  My  first  pictures  were  duds  and  consequently  I  missed  out.  Had  I  been  an  unknown  I  would  have  had  time  to  try  again.  Suppose  'The  Sin  of  Madelon  Claudet'  had  gone  out  as  it  was  originally  filmed.  Helen  Hayes  would  have  been  a  failure.  She  saw  it,  realized  its  faults  and,  with  her  husband,  Charles  Mac-  Arthur,  fought  for  a  mass  of  retakes.  They  had  their  way — and  Miss  Hayes  became  a  sensation.   "There  is  another  Hollywood  weakness.  You  never  can  tell  who  is  to  be  blamed  for  a  failure;  who  is  to  be  credited  for  a  success.  It  may  be  the  actor,  the  director,  the  electri-  cian who  lights  the  scenes,  some  able  directorial  assistant,  the  scenarist  or  the  cameraman.  Maybe  even  the  cutter.  I  have  discovered  that  the  cutter  can  ruin  your  scenes.  You  know  the  habit  of  cutting  scenes  right  after  the  big  lines.  The  snap,  the  tang  of  these  lines  may  be  due  to  a  lift  of  the  eyebrow,  a  movement  of  the  hands,  that  is  to  follow,  but  the  cutter,  unfamiliar  with  dramatic  technique,  does  not  know  that.  He  cuts — and  everybody  wonders  why  the  good  lines  curl  up  and  die  without  getting  the  expected  response.   "TN  all  my  screen  work  I  had  but  one  director  -*-of  ability,  George  Cukor.  And  even  he  was  learning  then.   "Another  reason  I  failed  was  because  I  did  smart,  high  comedy.  They  made  me  do  that  because  I  had  been  doing  it  on  the  stage.  Now  America,  as  a  whole,  doesn't  give  a  heck  about  brittle  dialogue,  subtle,  guarded  emotions  or  poised  epigrams.  As  I  grow  older  I  shall  do  character  roles  on  the  stage.  It  will  be  my  next  step.  Then,  when  I  get  a  good  one  with  lots  of  tear  jerking  moments,  I  hope  to  try  the  movies  again.  Character  roles  are  the  ones  that  bring  film  success.   "I  got  an  interesting  glimpse  of  Hollywood  when  I  went  back  last  summer  to  play  ten  weeks  on  the  stage  in  'Reunion  in  Vienna.'  Hollywood  was  suspicious  at  first,  suspecting  that  I  wanted  to  try  the  films  again.  Out  there  they  seek  a  motive  for  everything.  Actually  I  only  wanted  to  earn  some  money.   "I  went  to  some  of  the  parties  again.  There  were  the  same  people  still  talking  about  them-  selves, with  the  same  grievances,  the  same  worries.  Being  of  a  world  apart,  I  got  a  lot  of  good  laughs.  I  rather  enjoyed  the  experience.

I  knew  that  photo-  graphs of  my  bedroom  were  no  longer  studied  in  every  home  in  America  and  part  of  Europe,  not  to  mention  Asia.  Nobody  cared  enough  to  write  the  things  they  thought  I  ought  to  say."   Miss  Claire  surprised  me  in  talking  about  Greta  Garbo.  If  Hollywood  was  to  be  be-  lieved, Miss  Claire  once  viewed  the  Swedish  star  sharply,  as  a  previous — and  perhaps  un-  forgotten— love  of  her  actor  husband.  But  there  was  no  bitterness  in  Miss  Claire's  comment.     Quite  the  contrary.   "Miss    Garbo    is    the    greatest    actress    in    pictures  because  she  has  the  background,"  she  said.  "Nobody  seems  to  remember  her  fine  training  in  the  Stockholm  conservatory.  They  taught  her  the  essentials — how  to  move  gracefully,  to  dance,  to  fence,  to  study.  To  make  the  progress  she  has  made  in  pictures,  she  must  study  intensely.  To  do  that,  she  cannot  go  about  as  does  Hollywood,  taking  life  easily.  Consequently,  Hollywood  does  not  understand  her.   "Actually,  she  is  the  one  person  untouched  by  the  mad  town,  the  one  person  to  preserve  her  sanity  in  the  midst  of  insanity."    t?    Why  I'll  Return  to  the  Stage"    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  69    true  profession  which  has  proved  to  be  a  red  friend  is  fortunate,  so  one  who  makes  five  real  friends  in  a  lifetime  is  indeed  fortunate!   "You  know,  it  is  so  funny  to  have  come  to  this  town,  known  as  mad  Hollywood,  and  have  found  four  friends  who  mean  more  to  me  than  any  gold  statues  or  money  which  I  could  take  from  it.  When  I  am  huddled  over  the  fireplace  in  my  old  age,  smoking  my  corncob  pipe,  I  will  have  those  four  sitting  with  me  to  talk  things  over.  What  more  can  one  get  from  life?  I  didn't  have  that  in  the  East.  Just  one  friend  for  mother  and  me,  there.  Four  here.  That  makes  my  five.    I  am  a  fortunate  woman."   The  four  in  Hollywood  are  Norma  Shearer  and  Irving  Thalberg;  Clark  and  Ria  Gable  (Mrs.  Clark).  A  group  which  is  so  un-Holly-  wood  as  the  world  knows  this  city  that  they  are  difficult  to  understand  unless  you  study  them  together.   "TT  is  strange,  but  we  were  talking  about  this  -'■just  the  other  night,"  Helen  continued.  "We  even  made  up  a  game  to  test  whether  others  were  our  friends  or  our  acquaintances  We  decided  that  a  friend  is  one  whom  we  would  defend  violently.  One  of  my  so-called  friends  was  mentioned.  'But  she's  so  affected,'  some-  one said.  And  I  answered, '  Yes,  but  she  means  well—'   "  Don't  you  see  how  the  game  works?  That  wasn't  friendship.  There  are  no  buts  in  friend-  ship. If  anyone  had  said  anything  like  that  of  Norma  or  Irving  or  Ria  or  Clark,  he  would  have  left  my  house  with  a  black  eye.   "We  are  friends  only  to  those  who  are  cf  enough  importance  for  us  to  act  violently  in  their  defense.  And  we  have  few  people  who  be-  come of  enough  importance  to  us  for  that.  We  couldn't  act  violently  for  too  many.   "As  for  acquaintanceship.  I  ask  only  one  thing  of  it.  Charm.  Worth-while  acquaint-  ances should  be  able  to  tell  a  dinner-table  story  which  will  make  me  laugh  and  be  able  to  laugh  when  I  tell  a  good  one.  Acquaintances  should  make  the  surface  of  life  more  pleasant  for  one  another.    Charm.    That  is  all  that  is  necessary.   "One  woman  I  know  in  Hollywood  is  trying  to  make  a  career  of  friendship.  She  is  proud  of  being  'an  awfully  good  friend'  to  half  of  Holly-  wood and  defending  the  other  half  to  the  first.  It  can't  be  done.  She  is  attempting  to  spread  emotions  too  expansively.  She  says  she  is  always  frank  and  honest.  I  won't  bluff  with  you —   ""D  UT  I  don't  want  any  but  my  real  friends  to  -'-'be  frank  and  honest  with  me.  I  won't  allow  more  than  four  or  five  people  that  privilege.  .  .  .  And  I  won't  fight  with  ac-  quaintances. A  fight  is  too  intimate — it  is  the   privilege  of  friends.   "Which  reminds  me  of  another  acquaint-  ance. She  was  intensely  emotional  but  inter-  esting. A  certain  charm.  And  then,  suddenly,  I  found  we  were  on  the  brink  of  a  row.  There  was  no  fight.  I  withdrew.  She  never  knew  what  had  happened.  But  she  was  not  even  an  acquaintance  after  that.  A  fight  would  have  forced  an  unwelcome  friendship.    "Friendship  cannot  be  forced,"  Helen  Hayes  went  on,  thoughtfully.  "It  comes  or  ic  doesn't.  You  know  someone.  You  hear  something  about  him  and  suddenly  you  find  yourself  fighting  violently  for  him.  Friendship  has  come.  If  that  happens  five  times,  natur-  ally, during  one  life — you  are  wealthy.  But  you  don't  want  the  responsibility  of  having  it  happen  more  often."   TLJELEN  paused  and  smiled  that  rare  smile  -*-  -^which  lifts  her  face  from  wistfulness  to  real  beauty.  "I  just  can't  get  over  coming  to  Hollywood  and  finding  four  people  like  that  in  a  town  where  so  many  seem  to  think  friendship  consists  in  running  to  someone  and  saying,  '  I  am  your  friend  and  I  think  someone  should  tell  you  that  so-and-so  said  this  about  you.'   "Some  people  draw  remarks  like  that,  of  course,  as  the  roots  of  a  cactus  draw  water.  It  doesn't  happen  to  me  much  because  the  first  thing  I  do  when  I  land  in  a  town  is  to  let  every-  one know  how  sensitive  I  am.  If  people  think  I  am  sensitive,  they  don't  try  nearly  so  hard  to  become  that  type  of  friend.  I  am  probably  the  least  sensitive  person  in  the  world.  And  the  funny  part  of  it  is,  the  really  sensitive  people  are  the  kind  who  attract  that  type  of  friend."   Experts  on  the  art  of  acting,  who  never  mis-  take a  pretty  ankle  and  a  cute  nose  for  genius,  are  practically  unanimous  in  calling  little  Helen  Hayes  a  faultless  actress.  Their  archives  do  not  record  that  she  has  ever  failed  in  a  part  in  all  her  twenty  years  before  the  public.  And  Helen,  just  over  her  thirty  mark,  has  been  stage-playing  since  she  was  ten.   Painstakingly,  untiringly,  little  Hayes  has  poured  her  whole  existence  into  the  theater.  And  she  has  her  reward  today  in  love  and  glory.  She  began  when  she  was  a  tot  in  Wash-  ington, guarded  and  guided  by  her  mother.  One  of  her  mother's  treasured  pictures  is  a  snapshot  of  Helen,  taken  nineteen  years  ago  at  a  stage  door,  a  tike  in  white  sailor  suit,  with  rn  unruly  mop  of  yellow  hair.   A  ND  from  this  humble  beginning,  Helen  hr.s  -**-worked  and  studied  and  developed  a  his-  trionic ability  which  was  a  real  loss  to  Broadway  when  she  deserted  the  footlights  for  the  kliegs.   Helen  has  learned  much  about  life  in  her  brief  years.  And  from  that  wealth  of  experi-  ence which  has  helped  her  develop  her  re-  markable acting  talent,  she  has  learned  to  sift  the  dross  from  the  gold.   So  it  is  a  happy  thought  she  brings  us,  on  leaving  Hollywood  for  her  beloved  Broadway  again:   Five  friends  who  are  worth  the  privilege  of  being  unpleasant;  hundreds  of  acquaintances  who  are  allowed  to  furnish  charm.   The  stage  will  mean  much  more  work  for  Helen,  too.  Day  in  and  day  out.  No  rests  at  Palm  Springs.  No  trips  to  Europe  with  her  beloved  Thalbergs.  No  happy  vacations  at  the  beach  with  the  Gables.   But — though  the  charm  of  an  acquaintance-  ship with  picture-making  may  be  forgotten;  the  fidelity  of  Helen's  friendship  for  the  stage  remains!    Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933    97    Norma's  Love  Comes  First   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  31  \   Bennett  and  Bebe  Daniels.  "There's  a  '7'  on  my  cup — that  stands  for  zebra.  And  there's  a  'D'  that  stands  for  Daddy,"  he  went  on  and  on,  explaining  all  the  letters  of  the  alphabet.  A  precocious  laddy.  And  very,  very  sweet.   Irving  Thalberg,  who  at  thirty  years,  has  accomplished  more  than  most  men  do  in  a  lifetime,  and  who  at  eighteen  years  was  hailed  "the  boy  wonder"  of  the  motion  picture  industry  because  of  his  rare  business  and  artistic  acumen,  gazed  fondly  upon  his  son  and  then  said:   CERTAINLY,  we're  taking  him  to  Europe  with  us!  We  couldn't  be  at  peace  or  enjoy  ourselves  without  him.  We  took  him  to  Europe  two  years  ago  and  then  he  was  a  mere  babe.  I  have  grown  very  close  to  the  boy  in  the  past  couple  of  months.  Sickness  has  its  compensations — it  permits  a  busy  man  to  get  acquainted  with  his  family,  and  makes  him  realize  fully  what  the  real  values  in  life  are."   I  had  gone  down  to  see  Norma  to  ask  her  whether  she  felt  she  was  sacrificing  her  career  for  the  human  urges  of  love,  and  devotion  to  her  husband,  and  the  preservation  of  her  marriage.   At  the  time  Norma  and  Irving  and  the  baby  left  for  abroad,  six  months  had  elapsed  since  she  had  made  a  picture.  By  the  time  she  returns  and  finds  a  suitable  story  and  gets  into  production  on  the  first  picture  of  her  new  two-year  contract,  almost  a  year  will  have  passed  since  audiences  have  viewed  he/  in  "Smilin'  Through."  This  is  considered  a  seriously  long  while  for  a  star  of  Norma's  box-office  appeal  to  be  off  the  screen.    The  newest  design  for  sports  clothes  and  accessories  is  perforation — to  give  you  lots  of  cooling  air  when  strenuously  occupied.

On  the  other  hand,  I  have  discovered  that  it  is  no  saving  to  buy  cheap  cosmetics  for  I  have  been  using  a  cheap  powder  and  the  result  is  that  my  nose  and  chin  are  filled  with  blackheads.  Please  give  me  some  practical  advice.   Elaine  E . . . ,  Bronxville,  N.  Y.  DEAR  MISS  E .  . .  :   I  will  let  you  into  a  little  secret.  For  a  dollar  you  can  get  one  of  my  lipsticks  in  the  new  Red  Poppy  shade  or  Red  Raspberry  or  Red  Geranium  or  Red  Coral.  And  you  can  use  it  as  a  cheek  rouge  too.  Or  you  can  get  my  rouge  en  creme  in  either  of  the  four  Rubinstein  reds  and  use  it  for  your  lips.  That's  real  economy,  and  you  will  be  sure  you  are  getting  pure  cosmetics  that  contain  the  finest,  safest  ingredients  and  last  a  long  time.   Since  you  say  your  pores  have  become  opened  and  embedded  with  blackheads  because  you  have  been  using  cheap  powders,  I  think  you  will  be  interested  to  know  that  my  powders  are  only  1.00.  And  I  am  certain  you  will  adore  the  new  Peachbloom  shade.  To  get  rid  of  the  blackheads  you  now  have,  I  sug-  gest that  you  wash  with  my  Beauty  Grains  which  remove  all  skin  impurities.  They  are  from  .50  up.

Was  it  sacrifice  on  her  part?  I  know  many  famous  stars  who  would  not  have  done  it,  on  the  logical  grounds  that  it  interfered  with  their  careers.   Human  impulses  of  kindness  and  common  decency  notwithstanding.   "I  simply  can't  see  that  viewpoint,"  Norma  said  in  a  tempo  a  little  less  brisk  than  formerly.  Norma  has  always  talked  fast — she  thinks  fast — but  it  seems  to  me  that  there  is  a  mellowness  rounding  the  crisp  edges  of  her  words  these  days.  Philosophy  is  taking  a  deeper  hold  on  her.  She  appeared  as  gay  and  carefree  as  of  old,  but  a  new  and  very  at-  tractive quality  of  repose  has  superseded  her  former  smart  audacity.  It's  a  lovely  develop-  ment.   "Y\  THAT  sort  of  person  would  I  have  been   W  to  have  left  my  husband,  who  has  been  such  a  great  friend  and  helper  to  me,  at  the  time  when  he  really  needed  me?  At  least,  I  am  conceited  enough  to  feel  that  he  needed  my  companionship,  loyalty  and  understanding  when  he  was  sick  and  disturbed  over  the  million  troublesome  things  which  come  in  the  picture  business.   "Of  course,  if  I  had  been  in  the  middle  of  a  picture,  it  would  have  been  wrong  for  me  to  have  stayed  at  home,  no  matter  how  ill  Irving  was.  You  can't  expect  forgiveness  for  holding  up  a  costly  production  under  almost  any  circumstances.  And  Irving  would  never  have  permitted  me  to  do  so.  But  I  felt  I  could  hold  off  making  a  picture  at  this  time,  especially  since  the  right  stories  are  hard  to  find,  and  stay  close  to  my  husband.   "I  have  been  in  pictures  for  eleven  years —  they  are  so  much  a  part  of  me  that  I  can't  imagine  myself  separated  from  them.  They  are  much  of  my  life.   "But  just  the  same,  I  don't  think  they  ever  could  be  so  important  now  that  they  could  take  the  place  of  Irving.   "Once,  the  first  five  years  of  my  career,  there  was  nothing  of  importance  to  me  except  to  become  a  big  star  and  make  lots  of  money.  That's  all  that  mattered  to  me.  Maybe  that  sounds  shallow.   "But  it  didn't  seem  so  then.  It  was  more  than  an  ideal  with  me.  It  was  a  burning  necessity.    I  simply  had  to  become  a  star!   ""DUT  experience  changes  one.  Especially,  ■'-'the  experience  of  illness.  Suffering  seems  to  open  our  eyes  and  hearts  to  a  deeper  under-  standing of  life.  You  suddenly  realize  what  it's  all  about.  Just  seeing  an  active  man  like  Irving,  a  dynamo  of  energy  and  resistance,  suddenly  put  on  his  back  because  of  some  silly  little  germ  like  the  'flu' — seeing  that  terrifically  busy  life  abruptly  stopped  in  its  tracks — first  tore  my  heart,  and  then  made  me  stop  and  think.   "It  made  me  think  about  many  things.  Careers,  fame,  husbands,  children.  Careers,  I  decided,  were  unsteady  things.  Here  today  — gone  tomorrow.  Children,  I  knew,  were  the  greatest  experience  of  a  woman's  life.  But  after  all,  their  love  is  transitory.  They  re-  main at  home  until  their  wings  are  strong  enough  to  take  them  out  into  the  world— and  then  they  marry.  .And  you  are  alone.  A  hus-  band, I  realized,  is  the  most  important  love,  friend,  helpmate  in  a  woman's  world.  He  is  the  most  worthwhile  thing  a  woman  can  fight  for.   "I  don't  know  if  I  have  been  a  good  mother,  a  good  wife  and  a  good  actress,  all  at  the  same  time.  Three  careers  are  very  hard  for  the  strongest  and  ablest  of  women.  I  do  not  be-  lieve that  there  exists  any  woman  who  can  do  all  three  in  highest  order.  Of  course,  I  know  that  I  never  could  have  carried  on  the  three  careers  if  my  husband  had  been  in  any    other  line  of  work.  A  wife  who  comes  into  her  home  for  dinner  at  eight  o'clock,  with  make-up  on  and  feeling  exhausted,  and  a  husband  who  comes  home  from  his  work  at  six,  can't  possibly  have  a  very  happy  meeting  ground  night  after  night.   "I  remember  right  after  my  baby  was  born  there  was  only  one  thing  I  really,  wanted  to  do,  and  that  was  to  stay  at  home  with  him.  The  hardest  thing  I  ever  had  to  do  in  my  life  was  to  leave  him  and  go  back  to  work.  I  just  couldn't  seem  able  to  pull  myself  away  from  him.   "Yet,  some  of  my  most  successful  pictures  were  made  during  that  period.  I  suppose  that  should  be  consolation. "   ""THERE  were  tears  in  Norma  Shearer's  eyes  ■*■  when  she  told  me  this.  They  streamed  down  her  cheeks  and  dropped  heavily  onto  the  blouse  of  her  dress.   "There  are  nine  months  that  I  really  lost  out  of  little  Irving's  babyhood  and  I  sort  of  resent  them.  And  I  always  get  mad  when  I  think  of  the  times  when  I  returned  home  from  a  hard  day's  work  and  wanted  to  play  with  my  baby,  and  the  very  proficient  nurses  that  we  mothers  always  engage  for  our  first-born,  would  say  to  me,  'Not  now,  Mrs.  Thalberg.  You  musn't  see  the  baby  just  yet.  It  wouldn't  be  right.  You  will  disturb  him.  He  has  just  had  his  bottle.'  How  in  the  world  would  I  have  disturbed  my  baby?    I  was  his  mother!   "Irving  was  a  great  comfort  to  me  during  that  period.  And  also  a  fine  mentor.  He  didn't  mince  words  with  me  when  he  said,  'Well,  you've  got  your  baby,  and  you've  got  your  career.  You  always  wanted  to  be  a  big  movie  star.    Now  prove  it  by  sacrificing  for  it.'   "There  are  many  people  who  feel  that  be-  cause of  Irving's  position  in  the  M-G-M  organization,  I  have  had  all  the  best  acting  parts  handed  me.  Well,  that's  far  from  the  truth.  •  Being  the  boss's  wife  has  many  ad-  vantages and  also  disadvantages.  There  are  many  stories  I  yearn  to  do  but  Irving  is  too  honest  with  me  to  let  me  attempt  them.  After  all,  he  has  to  make  money  out  of  my  pictures  for  the  company  and  he  isn't  going  to  let  me  have  my  way  to  please  my  whims.  I've  got  to  make  pictures  that  bring  in  money  or  else  it  will  be  just  too  bad  for  me,  no  matter  whose  wife  I  am.   "But  Irving  has  been  wonderful  to  me  and  has  given  me  the  'breaks,'  as  he  has  every  other  actor  and  actress  on  the  lot.  And  it  would  be  foolish  for  me  to  say  that  he  didn't  feel  a  little  more  anxiety  for  my  pictures  when  he  previews  them  than  he  does  for  other  stars.  That's  only  natural.   "I  wouldn't  know  what  to  do  without  Irving.  He  is  such  an  encouragement  to  me  in  my  trials  and  disappointments.  I  always  feel  he  is  right  behind  me  urging  me  ahead.  That's  a  wonderful  thing,  isn't  it?  He  is  far  from  being  easy  on  me  in  his  criticisms  but  I  always  know,  for  that  reason,  when  he  says  a  thing  is  bad,  it  is,  and  when  he  admits  it  is  good  that  I  can  rely  on  it.   WOULD  you  believe  that  after  all  these  years  in  pictures,  the  first  time  I  ever  felt  that  I  really  belonged  to  the  business,  that  it  was  my  work,  was  in  'Strange  Interlude'  and  'Smilin'  Through'?  I  didn't  want  to  make  'Smilin'  Through.'  I  didn't  feel  it  was  my  type  of  role,  but  Irving  made  me  do  it.  But  for  the  first  time  in  my  entire  career  I  felt  no  self-  consciousness,  no  fear,  no  uncertainty — which  have  always  been  my  three  bugaboos.   "As  for  the  future,  all  I  can  say  is  that  I  feel  all  the  yearnings  for  great,  emotional  roles  that  any  terribly  ambitious  actress  does.  I  should  like  to  have  a  bigger  and  finer  career  in  this  business  that  I  love  so  much.  I  am  willing  to  work  always  harder  and  sacrifice  for  it.  But  I  will  never  sacrifice  the  love  of  my  husband  for  it.  A  career  is  meaningful  but  never  that  important.  Wherever  Irving  is,  and  my  baby,  there  I  want  to  be.  I  know  the  glory  of  that  happiness  and  I  never  want  it  destroyed."

Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933    IOI    Alice  Completes  Her  Cycle    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  50    A  rookie  in  the  army  doesn't  encounter  as  many  situations  needing  discreet  silence  as  a  raw  recruit  in  Hollywood.   Alice  White  never  suspected,  until  quite  re-  cently, that  anything  less  than  the  whole  truth  as  she  saw  it,  on  any  subject  whatsoever,  could  be  admirable  or  profitable.   HpHERE  was  no  one  to  tell  her  that  candor  ■*■  with  relationship  to  human  beings  must  be  tempered  with  discretion  and  delicacy.   She  spoke  her  mind  about  eve^thing  and  everybody,  never  with  any  intention  of  unkind-  ness,  but  because  she  knew  no  other  answers  than  truthful  ones.   This  honesty,  this  freedom  of  speech,  was  like  a  defiance  hurled  into  the  traditions  of  studio  deportment.  Very  few  individuals  whether  concerned  in  making  pictures  or  man-  ufacturing pretzels,  are  broad-minded  enough  to  tolerate  rock-bottom  frankness.   It  alienated  people  from  her.  Alice  did  not  understand.  She  did  not  know  how  to  be  other  than  herself.  If  they  resented  her,  well,  let  them!  It  aroused  her  fighting  blood.  She  was  too  young  to  reason.  She  thought  only  with  her  emotions.   She'd  show  them,  and  show  them  she  did.   It  bred  a  defense  mechanism  in  the  game    kid;  a  defense  to  keep  anyone  from  suspecting  how  deeply  she  longed  for  companionship  and  affection.  With  her  back  against  the  wail,  she  built  an  outward  front  that  completely  blinded  everyone  to  her  real  character  underneath.   She  became  cockier  than  ever.  If  the  studio  asked  her  if  she  thought  she  could  play  a  certain  part,  her  answer  was  the  same  no  matter  how  difficult  the  role  was.  "  Sure,  I  can  play  it.  Nobody  could  do  it  better.  Watch  me  get  every  bit  of  meat  out  of  it."  And  she  would.   Alice  disproved  the  theory  many  times  that  an  actor  is  only  as  good  as  his  material.  She  was  often  far  superior  to  the  parts  she  played.   "D  UT  such  self-reliance  in  one  so  inexperienced  -*-Avas  almost  a  sacrilege.  It  was  super-ego,  absurd  vanity,  the  studio  concluded.  It  pre-  vented anyone  from  trying  to  help  her.  If  her  clothes,  her  hair,  her  walk  needed  improving,  no  one  made  suggestions.  You  do  not  offer  aid  and  sympathetic  advice  to  one  who  apparently  has  no  need  of  them.   Alice  had  thrown  down  the  gauntlet.  She  went  to  great  lengths  to  show  people  she  was  sophisticated,  hard-boiled,  and  could  take  care  of  herself.   If  dresses  were  short,  Alice's  were  shorter.    Billie  Burke  looks  as  if  she  might  have  stepped  out  of  a  page  in  Godey's  Lady's  Book — yet  she  is  a  picture  of  modern  chic  in  this  charming  plaid  chiffon  gown.  The  lacy  mesh  gloves  and  even  the  line  of  her  straw  hat  lend  an  old-fashioned  air.

If  necklines  were  low,  Alice's  were  lower.   She  gave  out  thoughtless  interviews.  She  spoke  of  her  own  sex-appeal  and  the  havoc  it  had  wrought  here  and  there.  I  remember  she  talked  freely  of  the  many  jobs  she  had  lost  because  jealous  wives  would  get  one  look  at  the  White  face  and  figure  and  make  their  suscept-  ible husbands  fire  her.   She  discussed  at  great  lengths  her  come-  hither  capacity.   It  was  bad  judgment  and  it  was  bad  taste.   People  around  the  studio  gradually  but  firmly  let  Alice  alone.   They  spoke  of  her  then  as  "that  impossible  White  kid,"  but  usually  added,  "Goodness  knows,  she  can  act. "   CHE  did  a  good  job  of  creating  a  false  exterior  '-'for  herself,  and  all  the  while  she  was  just  a  scared  kid,  and  lonelier  than  a  ghost  in  a  deserted  village.   Her  popularity  with  the  movie-goers  in-  creased with  every  picture,  however.  They  adored  her.   I  believe  Alice  White  is  the  only  player  on  record  who  experienced  the  thrill  of  having  exhibitors,  who  played  her  pictures,  demand  that  the  producing  company  re-engage  her  after  her  contract  expired.   She  never  knew  of  this,  however,  until  long  after  First  National  had  given  her  a  new  agree-  ment.   Otherwise,  she  might  have  asked  for  and  received,  a  raise  in  salary.   As  it  was,  she  signed  at  the  old  salary,  which  was  small  indeed  as  compared  to  the  earnings  of  other  featured  players.   It  didn't  last  for  long,  though.  The  studio  had  lost  interest  in  Alice  White,  even  if  the  public  had  not.   One  day  she  found  herself  without  a  contract  and  no  prospect  of  one  in  sight.   Then  followed  a  period  of  idle  waiting  around  Hollywood  for  several  months.  Nothing  is  more  demoralizing.   Each  day  one's  estimate  of  one's  self  de-  creases until  courage  wears  perilously  thin.  Only  a  stout  heart  can  survive  a  long  period  of  idleness  in  the  town  where  everybody  talks  of  their  work  in  minutest  detail.   Eventually,  Alice  packed  her  bags  and  went  for  a  long  vaudeville  tour.  You  know  all  about  that.   It  was  a  great  triumph  for  her.   I  say  this  not  because  she  was  an  instan-  taneous hit  in  vaudeville,  and  not  because  loyal  followers  flocked  in  thousands  to  see  her  wherever  she  appeared.  It  was  a  triumph  for  her  because  of  the  thing  which  happened  within  Alice  herself.   On  the  long  train  jumps,  during  the  weary  hours  of  dance  practice,  during  the  vocal  lessons,  Alice's  one  thought  was  of  regaining  her  place  in  the  Hollywood  sun.   She  had  plenty  of  time  to  analyze  herself.  That  same  honesty  of  thought  which  had  caused  her  downfall  now  turned  unflinchingly  inward.   She  took  an  inventory  of  Alice  White's  short-  comings. She  put  her  faults,  like  a  fly,  on  the  point  of  a  pin  and  examined  them  microscop-  ically.   How  many  of  us  are  able  to  recognize  our  own  weaknesses  while  we  are  still  young  enough  to  make  a  fresh  start?   Alice  did.    IME  was  no  object  to  her.    She  returned  to  Hollywood  only  when  she  had  mastered  her-    T   self.   I  saw  her  just  after  she  got  back  out  there  and  before  she  had  started  work  on  "Em-  ployees' Entrance."   All  of  the  old  fire  of  Alice  White  was  there,  but  it  was  held  on  a  leash.  The  red-hot,  hot-  cha-cha  youngster  had  been  tamed,  but  not  extinguished.  The  quick,  immature  judgment  had  been  supplanted  by  tolerance  and  patience.  Most  of  all  patience,  which  is  the  modesty  of  the  intellect.   Not  a  word  of  resentment!     No  brooding    with  animosity  over  the  previous  treatment  accorded  her  in  Hollywood.   She  was  that  unusual  person  who  did  not  blame  her  fall  from  stardom  on  anyone  but  herself.   "It  has  not  been  easy,"  she  said.  " It's  hard  to  face  unpleasant  truths  about  oneself,  but  I  had  to.  There  was  no  one  else  on  whom  to  put  the  blame."   Again  the  honest  Alice  speaking.   ""EVERY  morning  my  chin  is  up  and  my  face   *— 'is  forward,"  she  went  on.  "I  am  grateful  for  the  opportunity  to  work  in  pictures  again  and  I  mean  to  prove  it.  I  am  trying  to  live  above  petty  things.  The  unimportance  of  trifles  is  a  motto  I  keep  always  before  me."   "What  is  your  chief  ambition  now,  Alice?"  I  asked  her*   "I  have  two,"  she  answered  quickly.  "I  want  to  become  known  as  a  fine  actress  in  many  kinds  of  parts.  I  never  want  to  be  a  star  again,  ever.  I  shot  up  too  quickly  before.  I  was  not  ready  for  the  responsibilities  of  star-  dom. Success  at  the  top  can  only  last  a  few  years  at  best.  Then  it  is  very  difficult  to  adjust  oneself  to  a  lesser  position.   "I  want  to  act  as  long  as  I  live,  and  when  you  are  recognized  as  a  capable  actress  in  any  role,  there  are  no  limitations  to  one's  career."   "You  mentioned  two  ambitions.  What's  the  other  one?  "  I  queried.   "I  want  Hollywood  to  like  me,"  she  an-  swered wistfully.  "I  mean  fellow  players,  all  the  people  I  work  with.  They  didn't  before,  you  know.   "It  didn't  sour  me  against  the  world,  but  it  hurt  terribly."   As  she  talked,  I  thought  of  what  the  old  massa'  himself,  Charlie  Chaplin,  once  said  to  her.   He  really  was  the  first  to  see  possibilities  in  the  White  youngster  and  give  her  en-  couragement about  a  picture  career.   Alice  was  a  script  girl  at  the  Chaplin  studio.  She  was  working  for  Von  Sternberg  who  was  directing  Edna  Purviance  under  Chaplin's  supervision.   One  day,  the  cameraman  had  to  test  out  a  new  lens  for  his  camera  and  needed  a  photo-  graphic subject.   Just  anyone  would  do.   A  LICE  was  a  favorite  on  the  set.  She  was  ■*  *-so  tiny  that  she  never  sat  straight  in  a  chair  but  usually  curled  her  legs  up  like  a  ball  with  her  feet  under  her.   This  earned  her  the  nickname  of  "Peter  Rabbit,"  which  was  eventually  shortened  to  "Pete."   "Pete"  begged  to  be  allowed  to  make  a  test  with  the  new  lens.   Without  make-up  of  any  kind  and  without  direction  of  any  sort,  they  permitted  her  to  cavort  before  the  camera.   She  did  every  fool  thing  that  came  into  her  head.   Of  course,  it  was  terrible,  but  no  one  looked  at  it  anyway,  except  the  cameraman,  and  he  was  only  looking  for  photographic  effects.   But  one  day  Chaplin  asked  how  the  new  lens  was  working  and  was  shown  Alice's  test.   Later,  he  came  onto  the  set  where  she  was  working  and  said,  "Pete,  you  should  go  in  pictures.  You've  got  something  different  from  anybody  else.    You  could  go  far."   It  planted  the  germ  in  her  head  which  finally  carried  her  to  stardom.   And  now  I  have  two  predictions  to  make.   Alice  need  not  worry  about  Hollywood  liking  her  this  time.  She  will  find  them  generous  with  their  companionship  and  affection  when  they  recognize  the  real  Alice  White  for  what  she  is  today.   And  lastly,  with  half  a  break,  the  career  which  she  has  begun  again  will  not  be  a  cycle  this  time.   It  will  be  a  spiral,  rising  slowly  but  steadily  to  a  very  fine  height  indeed,  because  as  Chaplin  said,   "She's  got  something  different  from  any-  body else."    Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933    IO    3    My  Sister,  Ann  Harding    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  53    Woods'  office  and  told  him  of  her  reception.  He  remarked,  quite  characteristically:   "  Why  the  s —  of  a !    Here,  sweetheart,   read  these — I'll  star  you  in  any  one  you  like. "  And  he  shoved  four  manuscripts  across  the  desk.   As  she  turned  to  go,  he  called  her  back  and  handed  her  a  fifth  script,  saying:   "Here,  read  this  and  give  yourself  a  good  time.  I  can't  give  it  to  you  because  Kit's  going  to  do  it,  but  tell  me  what  you  think  of  it."   It  was  "  The  Green  Hat. "  She  read  the  four  in  which  he  was  willing  to  star  her — all  very  depressing.   Then  she  read  "The  Green  Hat,"  returned  to  Woods'  office,  laid  the  four  on  his  desk  and  held  out  "The  Green  Hat,"  saying,   "This  is  the  one  that's  going  to  run.  I  don't  want  to  be  starred.  Kit's  a  grand  actress —  I'd  be  very  happy  to  support  her,  and  the  part  of  Venice  is  just  my  size."   "TF  you  will  do  this  for  me,  sweetheart,"  -^-exploded  Al,  "I'll  give  you  anything  you  want — but  your  salary."  He  picked  up  the  phone.  "Get  me  Lee  Shubert  .  .  .  Lee,  you  gotta  give  me  a  better  percentage  on  that  house!  Look  at  the  cast  I  got!  Kit  Cornell,  Leslie  Howard,  Ann  Harding — "   This  went  on  for  minutes — it  was  a  terrible  fight.   He  hung  up  the  receiver  finally  and  an-  nounced:   "Okay,  kid,  we  start  rehearsal  next  week.  What'll  you  take?"   "I  don't  care  what  it  is  so  long  as  it  comes  in  every  week  for  a  while.  Give  me  whatever  the  part  is  worth."   Which  unprofessional  remark  nearly  finished  Al  for  the  day.   "The  Green  Hat"  opened  in  Detroit  and  by    the  middle  of  the  week  Ann  had  to  draw  some-  thing on  her  salary  with  which  to  eat.  So  she  went  to  the  manager  and  asked  him  what  her  salary  was,  thinking  it  was  probably  around  one  hundred  fifty  dollars  a  week.   "Doncha  know  what  your  salary  is?"  The  man  couldn't  believe  his  ears.   "No,"  said  she.   "Well,  in  case  you're  interested,  it's  three  hundred  dollars  a  week."   ON  Saturday  her  pay  envelope  contained  four  hundred  dollars  and  a  wire  from  Woods  to  the  manager  authorizing  this  sum.  While  she  was  still  pondering  this  phenomenon,  Woods  himself  came  on  from  New  York  and  offered  her  a  contract,  which  she  signed  on  the  spot.   She  wondered  at  the  time  what  he  meant  when  he  said,  as  soon  as  she  had  signed,   "Now  I'll  fix  the  so-and-so."  She  found  out  a  few  days  later.  It  seems  that  Colonel  Savage  had  failed  to  cast  "Stolen  Fruit"  dur-  ing these  months  and  had  finally  decided  that  Ann  was  the  one  for  the  part.  But  he  had  reckoned  without  Al.  By  signing  her  up  with  an  exclusive  contract,  Woods  made  him  pay  well  for  her  services.  Savage  had  been  forced  to  give  him  half  of  the  show  in  order  to  get  her!   "CTOLEN  FRUIT"  established  her  once  and  ^for  all  as  star  material.   The  press  hailed  her  as  the  new  Bernhardt,  another  Duse;  but  she  refused  to  be  starred,  preferring  to  impress  audiences  by  her  per-  formance rather  than  by  seeing  her  name  billed  first  over  the  marquee.   After  a  highly  successful  run  in  New  York,  "Stolen  Fruit"  went  on  the  road  and  closed  in  Detroit  in  May.  Ann  had  had  five  years  of  uninterrupted  work,  no  vacations,  no  rest;  she    Here  we  see  Ann  Harding  and  Harry  Bannister  in  one  of  those  rarefies  of  the  film  world — a  husband  and  wife  cast  as  such  in  a  picture.

Hotel  Sherman,  Chicago     .     415  Greenwich  St.,  New  York    Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933   had  reached  such  a  point  of  utter  weariness  that  it  became  an  effort  to  eat,  impossible  to  carry  on  a  conversation,  unthinkable  to  start  work  on  another  play.   But  she  accepted  an  offer  to  take  over  the  old  Garrick  Theater  in  Detroit  at  once  and  run  a  stock  company  there  for  the  summer  season.   Rollo  Peters,  also  of  "Stolen  Fruit,"  was  persuaded  to  join  the  company,  and  Detroit  was  treated  to  an  unusually  fine  season  of  stock.   Toward  the  end  of  the  summer,  her  one  venture  as  actress-manager,  she  found  herself  without  a  leading  man  for  the  last  two  weeks  of  the  season.   Mr.  Peters  had  been  recalled  to  New  York  for  a  new  play.   She  was  very,  very  tired  by  that  time  and  when  the  manager  of  the  theater  told  her,  "There's  a  guy  who  has  just  closed  here  in  'White  Cargo' — looks  like  a  good  leading  man,"  she  just  said  wearily,  "All  right,  sign  him  up."   "tvTEEDING  a  rest  badly,  she  had  put  on  a  ■^•^play  that  did  not  require  her  services  in  the  cast  for  that  week,  and  was  enjoying  a  quiet  dinner  with  some  friends.   Just  as  the  coffee  was  being  served,  the  manager  called  her  on  the  phone  and  asked  her  to  come  down  to  the  theater  and  meet  this  prospective  leading  man.   "I  don't  want  to  sign  him  without  your  okay,  Miss  Harding,"   he  said.   "If  he  looks  all  right  and  doesn't  want  too  much  money,  you  have  my  okay  right  now.  I've  seen  all  the  actors  I  can  stand  for  this  year!"   "He  looks  great,  but  he  wants  a  lot  of  money,"  was  the  troubled  reply.   "Does  he  look  good  enough  to  be  worth  it?"  asked  Ann,  with  a  sigh.   "That's  what  I  want  you  to  decide."   So  she  left  the  table,  got  rebelliously  into  her  car  and  went  down  to  the  Garrick,  where  she  met — Harry  Bannister.   She  decided  that  he  did  look  good  enough  to  be  worth  his  outrageously  high  salary.  He  got  the  job.   At  the  close  of  the  season,  she  rushed  back  to  New  York,  already  a  few  days  late  for  re-  hearsals of  "A  Woman  Disputed,"  with  Lowell  Sherman.   Harry  came  to  New  York  also  and  went  into  rehearsal  of  "Yellow,"  George  M.  Cohan's  play.   They  saw  a  great  deal  of  each  other  during  the  next  few  weeks,  and  his  whirlwind  court-  ship resulted  in  their  becoming  engaged.  Very  shortly  thereafter  they  were  married  at  The  Little  Church  Around  the  Corner.   It  was  to  be  a  very  quiet  wedding.  Dean  Ray  had  asked  if  they  wanted  ushers,  but  was  assured  that  they  would  not  be  necessary,  as  not  more  than  a  dozen  or  so  people  had  been  invited.   However,  an  early  edition  of  the  afternoon  papers  spread  the  news  on  the  front  page.  When  we  got  to  the  church  the  street  was  blocked,  special  traffic  officers  had  been  summoned,  the  sidewalks  were  jammed,  the  yard  was  filled  with  the  overflow  from  the  church.   YX  THEN  Ann  turned  from  the  altar  after  the  W  service  had  been  read,  she  saw  for  the  first  time  that  the  church  was  filled  with  old  friends,  most  of  whom  she  had  not  seen  since  grammar  and  high  school  days  in  Montclair  and  East  Orange.   Then  a  tall  figure  approached,  dressed  in  familiar  O.  D.  uniform.  It  was  Colonel  George  Vidmer,  a  friend  of  father's,  who  told  Ann  that  the  only  quarrel  he  had  ever  had  with  George  Gatley  was  over  his  attitude  regarding  her  going  on  the  stage — that  he  thought  the  Army  should  be  represented  at  this  wedding  and  that  he  had  come  in  from  Long  Island  to  pay  his  respects.   The  tears  were  hard  to  control  this  time,  but  she  squeezed  his  hand  in  appreciation,  in  lieu  of  the  words  which  were  somehow  choked    BY  THE  DAY   at  the   SHERRY-NETHERLAND   1933  rates   You  may  think  of  the  Sherry-Nether-  land  as  an  exclusive  residence  hotel.

Father  had  not  even  replied  to  her  letter  telling  him  of  her  approaching  marriage.   DURING  the  following  year  while  on  the  road  with  "A  Woman  Disputed,"  she  suffered  a  complete  breakdown,  but  could  not  be  convinced  of  the  fact.  To  the  eternal  credit  of  the  doctors,  let  it  be  said  that  they  each  and  every  one  told  her  the  same  story — that  the  only  thing  for  her  to  do  was  not  to  go  to  the  theater  at  all — that  if  she  insisted  upon  being  such  a  fool,  they  would  wash  their  hands  of  her — that  the  sooner  she  became  unconscious  and  could  not  drive  her  steps  to  the  stage  door,  the  better  off  she  would  be.   She  finally  collapsed  on  the  stage.  She  should  have  been  taken  to  a  hospital  at  once,  but  the  curtain  was  held  for  forty-five  minutes  while  an  incompetent  doctor  worked  over  her  with  the  one  idea  of  getting  her  back  onto  the  stage  as  quickly  as  possible.   Finally,  in  a  semi-conscious  condition,  she  was  dressed  and  actually  thrust  onto  the  stage,  managing  only  by  sheer  force  of  indomitable  will  to  get  through  the  rest  of  the  perform-  ance.   She  got  back  to  her  hotel  under  the  doctor's  supervision,  but  he  permitted  her  to  return  to  the  theater  that  night.   As  she  reached  for  her  make-up  she  quite  suddenly  went  out  of  her  head.  It  was  the  only  real  case  of  hysterics  she  has  ever  had  in  her  life.   She  sent  for  the  stage  manager  and  told  him  that  there  was  a  girl  upstairs,  playing  a  bit,  who  knew  Ann's  lines — she  was  a  good  little  actress  and  could  be  depended  upon  to  step  right  into  the  show  and  give  a  good  per-  formance.   Ann  was  informed  that  if  she  did  not  go  on  herself,  the  management  would  have  to  refund  the  three  thousand  dollars  which  a  sold-out  house  had  netted,  and  that  she  would  have  to  reimburse  the  theater  in  full  for  that  loss.   "Wasn't  she  a  trouper?"  and  "Where  was  her  pride?"   "What  about  the  old  tradition  'The  Show  Must  Go  On'?"   She  could  just  get  herself  out  there  on  the  stage — or  else  .  .  .   "DOR  the  one  and  only  time  in  her  life  she  lost  *■  control  of  herself  entirely,  grabbed  things  off  the  make-up  shelf  and  threw  them  indis-  criminately about  the  room.   She  told  them  in  no  uncertain  terms  exactly  where  they  could  go  and  ordered  them  out  of  her  dressing-room.   Ann  was  finally  persuaded  by  this  break-  down that  a  rest  was  imperative,  and  she  was  bundled  off  to  a  heavenly  rest  resort  in  the  Catskills.   During  the  first  week  or  so  she  would  burst  into  tears  at  any  mention  of  her  stepping  onto  a  stage  again — ever!  Gradually  the  feeling  wore  off  and  in  the  fall  she  returned  as  usual  to  her  Woods  contract,  this  time  in  "The  Trial  of  Mary  Dugan,"  her  last  great  success  on  the  stage.   It  was  a  new  Ann  Harding  who  reported  at  the  Woods  office.   Her  eyes  danced  with  excited  anticipation  as  she  read  the  script  in  Al's  office.   But  what  was  this?   As  originally  written,  the  play  was  divided  into  three  separate  acts  with  the  usual  con-  ventional curtains.   The  first  act  curtain  was  built  to  quite  a  climax,  culminating  in  the  bringing  onto  the  stage  of  a  life  size  nude  photograph  of  Mary  Dugan.   "What  are  you  going  to  do  here,  Al,  in-  stead of  the  photograph?"  she  asked  him  quietly.   "Why,  sweetheart,  that's  the  best  first  act  curtain  I've  staged  in  ten  years.  Now  don't  worry,"  as  he  saw  the  light  of  battle  gathering  in  darkening  eyes,  "I'm  not  asking  you  to  pose  for  it — I  got  that  all  fixed — got  something  to  show  you."    Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933   He  rang  a  buzzer  and  asked  his  secretary  to  bring  in  the  Mary  Dugan  stills.  The  secretary  returned  staggering  under  several  seven-foot  photos.   "See,  sweetheart,"  exulted  Al,  in  his  most  ingratiating  manner,  "I  got  a  Follies  girl  to  pose  for  it!"   Ann  gaped  at  the  photograph.   They  had  put  a  blonde  counterfeit  of  the  Harding  hair  on  the  girl  and  had  her  lovely  nude  body  posed  with  the  head  turned  quite  to  one  side,  so  that  to  all  intents  and  purposes  it  was  a  life  size  study  of  Ann  Harding  in  the  nude!   "  A  L  WOODS !"  she  gasped,  "I  know  I  didn't  -**-pose  for  it,  but  the  people  out  front  could  never  be  convinced  of  the  fact.  Take  it  out  of  here — tear  it  up — burn  it!  I  wouldn't  do  that  for  any  play  or  any  manager,  and  I  don't  want  the  public  to  think  I  did."   "But,  sweetheart,  it's  my  first  act  curtain!"  He  was  almost  crying.   "Well  then,  don't  have  any  curtain!"  she  stormed.  "I  will  not  sanction  that  photograph,  do  you  understand?  If  you  must  have  it,  just  get  someone  else  to  play  the  part  who  won't  mind  going  onto  the  same  stage  with  that  picture!"   "But  Ann — be  reasonable — listen — don't  you  see — the  sort  of  girl  who  would  stand  for  that  isn't  the  type  I  want  for  the  part!"   This  outburst  of  mixed  logic  was  too  much  for  Ann.   She  appealed  to  Equity.   "As  a  matter  of  fact,  Miss  Harding,  we  are  unable  to  help  you.  You  are  engaged  to  act  in  the  play.   "That  is  a  definite  part  of  the  play  and  we  cannot  stand  behind  you  if  you  refuse  to  play  it  as  written. "   That  dictum  meant  that  if  she  refused  she  was  out  of  the  theater  or,  at  best,  would  suffer  a  long  suspension  for  violation  of  contract.   "All  right,"  she  said,  "I  can  always  go  back  to  punching  a  typewriter."  And  what's  more,  she  meant  it.   Woods  finally  compromised  by  draping  the  model  in  a  definitely  boudoir  but  thoroughly  modest  fashion  which,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  did  not  eliminate  the  "kick"  from  the  drama,  as  he  had  feared.   Toward  the  end  of  May,  the  impending  arrival  of  little  Jane  caused  her  withdrawal  from  the  "Mary  Dugan"  cast.  Harry  had  arranged  to  return  to  Pittsburgh  that  summer  with  their  own  stock  company.   They  started  out  with  high  hopes,  but  it  turned  out  to  be  a  hectic  and  disappointing  season,  brightened  only  by  the  arrival  of  Jane  en  July  24th.   That  winter  Harry  started  rehearsal  in  "Strange  Interlude,"  with  the  Theatre  Guild.  "Strange  Interlude"  was  to  come  to  Cali-  fornia after  the  New  York  run,  with  one  week  stops  across  the  country  en  route.   Ann  arranged  the  cancellation  of  her  con-  tract with  Woods,  after  making  a  final  appearance  in  "Mary  Dugan"  in  Newark,  and  bundled  Jane  and  the  nurse,  the  crib  and  the  carriage  onto  a  train  heading  for  Los  Angeles.  She  rented  a  dear  little  place  in  Pasadenr. —  a  small  house  with  a  real  yard,  surrounded  by  a  white,  vine-covered  wall,  where  Jane  could  lie  in  her  carriage  under  real  orange  trees.   A  BOUT  a  month  later  the  "Strange  In-  -*Merlude  "  company  arrived  in  Los  Angeles.  Through  their  publicity  man  the  news  leaked  out  that  Harry  Bannister's  wife  was  with  him,  that  she  was  Ann  Harding  of  "The  Trial  of  Mary  Dugan,"  etc.-   Just  at  that  time  the  panic  was  on  in  the  various  studios  during  the  transition  period  from  silence  to  sound.   Here  was  manna  dropped  from  heaven —  three  of  the  largest  studios  called  for  her  to  make  appointments  for  tests — and  her  brief  period  of  retirement  was  at  an  end.   All  that  has  happened  since  the  signing  of  her  contract  with  Pathe  has  become  front  page  news,  and  needs  no  repetition  here.    //    I  always  notice  perfume"   "I'M  VERY  susceptible  to  perlumes —  all  men  are.

Helen  is  usually  coming  in  the  front  door  just  as  Adrienne  hides  under  the  bed.  Or  Adrienne's  husband  is  everlastingly  ringing  the  front  doorbell,  just  as  Maurice  and  I  get  really  interested.  What  I'm  going  to  do,  one  of  these  days,  is  get  hold  of  that  husband  part  and  chew  it  to  mince  meat.  There's  no  place  in  a  Chevalier  and  LeRoy  picture  for  ajius-  band.   I  must  confess,  I'm  terribly  fond  of  Helen.  She  plays  my  nurse  in  the  picture,  and  "Good  Night  Nurse"  do  we  cut  capers?  Maurice  falls  in  love  with  her  in  the  picture,  but  I  give  him  plenty  of  competition.  After  all,  what's  he  got  that  I  haven't  got?  With  the  possible  exception  of  an  accent.   I  fixed  him,  too.  There  was  one  colossal  set  where  I'm  in  bed.  Helen  is  tucking  the  covers  over  me  when  in  comes  Maurice.   "Helen,  I  loff  you,"  he  says.  Suddenly,  my  ire  was  ud.  So  I  let  out  one  long,  loud  rasp-  berry.    "Pffft,"  like  that.     The  bubbles  flew.    Maurice  looked  surprised.  "Here,  don't  do  that,  LeRoy,"  he  said.  "You  mustn't  give  me  the  raspberry."  Oh,  I  mustn't  eh,  I  thought.    Try  to  stop  me.   So  they  tried  the  scene  over.  "Helen,  I  loff  you,"  he  said.  "Pffft,"  I  went,  even  louder.  Maurice  was  furious.  Our  director,  a  nice  fat  man  called  Norman  Taurog,  couldn't  help  but  laugh.  The  cameraman  had  choked  back  a  laugh  till  his  face  was  purple.  And  Maurice  was  getting  madder  and  madder,  I  could  see  that.   So  he  tried  it  again.  "Helen — ,"  was  all  he  said  when  "Pfffffft,"  I  went,  and  this  time  the  bubbles  were  thick.  Maurice  jerked  back  in  surprise  and  the  director  gave  one  long  whoop  while  they  led  the  cameraman  out  in  convulsions.     So  we  gave  up  the  scene.   After  all,  they  made  me  a  movie  star.  I  never  asked  to  be  one.  And  they'll  have  to  put  up  with  my  temperament  and  like  it.   T  HEARD  the  director  tell  something  they  call  ■*■  a  supervisor,  that  every  time  I  took  a  nap  when  they  were  ready  to  shoot  a  scene,  it  cost  Paramount  just  two  thousand  dollars.  You  see,  they  never  waken  me  when  I  want  to  sleep.  The  director,  in  fact  everyone,  is  kind  and  thoughtful,  I'll  say  that.  But  I  found  a  way  to  check  that  Maurice  from  chiseling.   The  next  day,  they  were  all  ready  to  shoot  the  scene  over.  The  lights  were  placed,  the  cameraman  ready,  Helen  was  standing  over  me,  the  director  said  "Camera"  and  in  came  Maurice.  "Helen,"  he  said.  And  that  ended  it.  I  simply  lay  back  and  went  to  sleep  on  them.  And  the  scene  was  out.  It  may  have  set  Mr.  Paramount  back  several  grand  but  it  did  the  trick,  anyway.    Am  I  learning?    After  all,  I'm  the  only  star  in  this  picture  with  his  own  portable  dressing-room.  Just  like  Joan  Crawford's.  Every  day,  my  dressing-  room  is  wheeled  from  set  to  set.  Does  Chev-  alier have  a  portable  dressing-room?  Does  he  have  his  own  little  electric  stove?  His  own  refrigerator?     His  own  little — ,  well,  skip  it.   AND  how  many  times  a  day  does  he  lunch?  Once.  Once,  mind  you,  while  I  lunch  five  times.  Of  course,  he  can  sing.  I'll  admit  that.  But  can  he  put  his  toe  in  his  mouth  the  way  I  can?  Or  make  bubbles?  Yeah,  I'd  like  to  see  him.   And  he  can't  go  to  sleep  in  the  middle  of  a  scene  and  get  away  with  it,  either.  Only  I  and  Lionel  Barrymore  can  do  that.  And,  tell  me  this,  does  he  have  a  sign  like  mine  on  his  cart  that  says,  "Do  not  touch  the  buggy"?  Exclusive,  that's  me.   Of  course,  he's  got  a  real  stand-in,  while  mine's  only  a  doll  full  of  sawdust.  But,  if  you  ask  me,  there're  a  lot  of  people  around  this  town  full  of  sawdust.   Between  scenes,  they  wheel  me  out  onto  a  grassy  plot  on  the  lot.  And  do  I  attract  the  beautiful  women?  There's  one  gorgeous  blonde  who  comes  to  see  me  every  day.  Peggy  Hopkins  Joyce,  they  call  her.  Me.  I  just  grab  right  hold  of  my  buggy  and  keep  my  equilibrium  when  she  says,  "Oo  is  the  tootest  ittle  sing  I  ever  saw,  oo  is."   Tell  Chevalier  he  is  "the  tootest  ittle  sing  she  ever  saw,"  and  that  Frenchman  would  be  running  around  in  circles.     Calm,  that's  me!   Besides,  I  have  my  own  limousine  and  chauffeur  that  drive  me  home  from  the  studio  every  night.  And  come  for  me  every  morn-  ing.   Am  I  a  star,  or  am  I  the  star?   My  director  calls  me,  "Howda."  "King  Howda."  Cute  name,  eh?  I  like  it  better  than  Jackie  Cooper  or  Bobbie  Coogan.  "King  Howda,"  now  really  has  class.   There's  one  man  in  my  picture  called  Edward  Everett  Horton,  who  simply  tickles    Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933   me  to  death.  Now  mind,  I  like  him  very  much,  but  there's  something  about  him  that  just  throws  me  into  fits.  I  think  it's  his  face.  I  just  can't  look  at  that  face  without  gurgling  myself  into  spasms.  Why  every  time  I'm  ready  to  make  a  serious  or  dramatic  scene,  I  have  to  be  sure  Edward  Everett  is  locked  in  the  closet,  or  under  a  bed  somewhere,  before  I  can  go  on.   There  was  that  bath  sequence,  where  I'm  in  the  tub  and  Maurice  skids  on  a  piece  of  soap,  and,  suddenly,  he's  in  the  tub  also.  You  can't  even  take  a  bath  in  private  in  the  movies,    it    seems.   Well,  I  was  doing  my  scene  just  fine  when,  suddenly,  Maurice  and  I  looked  up  and  there  stood  Edward  Everett,  with  that  face  and  a  doily  on  his  head  for  a  cap  and  we  both  nearly  drowned.   Shocks  like  that  are  bad.   Yes,  movie  acting  has  its  hardships.  There  are  interviews  to  give,  and  you  should  hear  me  lay  it  on  during  interviews;  and  publicity  pictures  to  pose  for,  and  all  sorts  of  nonsense.   "pOR  instance,  someone  got  the  bright  idea,  ■*■  I  should  have  a  mental  test.  Imagine,  a  movie  star  surviving  a  mental  test.  Anyway,  they  brought  out  a  professor  of  psychology  from  the  University  of  California  and  every-  one gathered  around  to  watch.   Just  after  we  began,  I  made  a  sudden  leap  in  the  air.  "Why,  his  manipulatory  develop-  ment is  perfect,"  the  professor  said.   Well,  I  thought,  if  you  had  a  safety  pin  sticking  in  you,  your  manipulatory  develop-  ment would  be  even  hotter.   Yes,  we  actors  certainly  do  lead  a  life.  What  we  go  through  for  the  sake  of  art  is  a  crime.  And  when  this  picture  is  over,  and  I  can  get  this  Chevalier  off  my  hands,  I  plan  to  go  away  for  a  long  time.  Out  in  the  open  spaces  where  I  can  get  away  from  it  all.   Alone,  and  at  peace  with  my  toe  in  my  mouth  and  my  bottle  by  my  side.    I07    Who's  Zoo  In  Hollywood    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  59  ]    Yes,  it's  a  bitter  fate  for  a  hard  he-man  to  face.  But  many  a  hard  he-man  is  facing  it  in  Hollywood  today.   A  slightly  inebriated  actor,  long  out  of  work,  returned  home  in  the  early  morning  hours.  His  wife  waited  for  him  to  come  upstairs.  One  hour  passed.  Two  hours  passed.  Becoming  alarmed,  she  crept  to  the  stairway  and  beheld  her  husband  behind  the  open  front  door,  with  a  club  in  one  hand  and  waving  a  pork  chop  in  the  other.   "Shush,"  he  called  to  her,  "go  back  to  bed.  I'm  waiting  for  'the  wolf  at  the  door'  to  stick  his  head  in.  I'll  stun  him  with  this  club  and  we  can  put  him  in  the  movies.  We'll  be  rich,  honey,  we'll  be  rich."   Queenie,  the  chimpanzee,  was  the  star  of  "Kongo."  After  the  first  day's  rushes,  there  was  no  question  about  it.  Queenie  was  it.  Between  scenes,  she  sat  in  her  little  rocking  chair  and  rocked.  Handing  out  a  polite  rasp-  berry to  one  and  all  who  passed.  Except  Lupe  Velez.    Where  Lupe  went,  Queenie  went.   QUEENIE  sat  off  in  her  rocking  chair  and  -watched  Lupe  at  her  make-up  box,  patting  on  the  powder,  using  the  lipstick  and  mascara.  Quietly  she  sat  and  took  it  in.   A  moment  later,  Lupe  was  called  into  the  scene.  Every  eye  was  on  the  action.  Then  came  time  for  Queenie  to  join  the  scene.  The  cue  was  given,  in  steps  Queenie,  and  two  cameramen  took  to  the  rafters,  the  director  fell  in  a  swoon,  six  electricians  ran  screaming  from  the  place,  while  Lupe  rolled  on  the  floor  in  hys-  terics.   For  there  was  Queenie.  A  ghastly,  hideous  sight,  with  face  powder  from  head  to  foot,  lip    rouge  on  the  end  of  her  tail  and  mascara  dripping  from  her  whiskers.   It  took  two  days  to  scrape  the  make-up  off.   Every  morning  Lupe  and  Queenie  played  hide-and-seek.  Queenie  would  hide  and  Lupe  would  hunt.  Then  Lupe  would  hide  and  Queenie  would  hunt.   HPHEN  came  the  morning  Lupe  didn't  have  ■*■  to  work.  Queenie  and  Walter  Huston  had  a  heavy  scene  to  do  alone  that  day.  But,  at  ten  thirty,  Lupe's  phone  rang.  "Lupe,"  the  director  said,  "could  you  come  over?  Queenie  won't  act  and  I'm  nearly  crazy."  "What's  the  matter  with  Queenie?"  Lupe  asked.  "She  wants  to  play  T  Spy,'  "  the  director  groaned.  "I've  hid,  the  electricians  hid,  the  cameraman  has  hid  and  it's  done  no  good.    She  wants  you."   "No,  no,"  Lupe  said,  "I  must  have  rest  to-  day.   Queenie  will  be  all  right."   At  two  o'clock,  the  phone  rang  again.  It  was  the  voice  of  a  famous  and  dignified  execu-  tive. "Lupe,  listen,"  he  said,  his  voice  quiver-  ing, "would  you  do  this  just  for  me?  Couldn't  you  come  over  and  play  'Hide-and-go-seek'  for  just  a  little  while  with  Queenie?  Look,  Lupe,  every  one  on  this  lot  has  been  trying  to  play  it.  For  two  hours,  Lupe,  where  have  I  been?  In  the  rafters,  trying  to  get  Queenie  to  hunt  me.  And  she  don't  even  know  I'm  gone  yet.  If  you  could  only  just  play  it,  Lupe,  we  could  get  this  scene  today."   "All  right,  I'll  come,"  Lupe  said.  Twenty  minutes  later,  Lupe  burst  onto  a  disheartened  sound  stage.  Every  one  sat  about  in  deep,  dismal  gloom.  With  a  whoop,  Queenie  was  at  her.  And  for  ten  minutes,  an  amazed  crew  watched  an  exciting  game  of  T  Spy'  with    Lustrous  Color  for   STREAKED  HAIR   Have  ever-youthful  looking  hair  this  SAFE  way.

The  game  over  Queenie  steps  into  the  scene  and  gives  a  performance  that  slays  'em.   Believe  it  or  not,  it  has  reached  the  place  that,  unless  you  actually  resemble  a  snarling  lion,  can  bark  like  a  frost-bitten  seal  or  slink  like  a  panther,  you  have  no  more  chance  in  the  movies  than  a  rabbit.  Rabbit  nothing.  You'd  probably  end  up  by  becoming  stand-in  for  the  rabbit.   A  PE-MEN  contests  are  waged.  Lion-men  ■'^■contests  are  waged.  Panther-women  con-  tests are  waged.  Many  a  man  has  run  screaming  from  his  house  when  wifie  came  in  with  the  breakfast  toast,  slinking  with  what  she  imagined  was  a  pantherish  slink.   They  found  "Tarzan,  the  Ape  Man"  in  Johnny  Weissmuller.  At  tremendous  expense,  they  hired  monkeys  and  chimpanzees.  They  took  off  Johnny's  clothes,  made  up  his  face,  gave  him  a  yell,  and  the  fun  was  on.  The  monkeys  licked  the  make-up  off  his  face,  as  fast  as  he  could  put  it  on,  and  the  first  time  Johnny  let  out  his  ear-splitting  scream,  the  chimps  took  to  the  tall  trees  and  for  days  could  neither  be  begged  nor  coaxed  down.   In  Buster  Crabbe,  they  found  their  "Lion  Man."  "Now,  there's  nothing  to  it,"  they  kept  telling  the  slightly  nervous  Buster.  "Nothing  at  all.  These  lions  are  absolutely  harmless.  Now,  just  to  have  you  get  used  to  lions,  we'll  have  you  pose  with  Nemo.  Every-  one knows  good  old  Nemo.  Harmless  as  a  kitten."   So,  finally  persuaded  all  was  indeed  well,  Buster  removes  his  breeches,  dons  a  loin  cloth  and  enters  the  cage  with  Nemo — whereupon  good,  old,  harmless  Nemo  flew  at  him  and  nearly  bit  the  leg  off  the  "Lion  Man."   In  Kathleen  Burke,  they  found  their  "Panther  Woman"  for  "The  Island  of  Lost  Souls."  They  did  cattish  things  to  her  eye-  brows, taught  her  to  slink,  and  look  felinish  at  the  drop  of  the  hat.   Then,  when  they  were  all  ready,  she  sud-  denly remembered  there  was  just  one  thing  she'd  forgotten  to  mention.  She  just  loathed  cats  of  any  size  and  any  shape.  And  if  they  didn't  mind,  she'd  just  use  sheep  dogs  in  the  jungle  scenes.  And  that  one  sent  a  producer  to  a  rest  cure  for  six  months.   For  "King  of  the  Jungle"  one  scene  called  for  all  the  animals,  male  and  female,  lions,  leopards  and  tigers  to  be  let  loose  to-  gether. "It  can't  be  done,"  Mr.  Al  Barnes  said,  who  owned  the  animals.  "It  never  has  been  done.  The  females  will  kill  the  males,  the  tigers  will  destroy  the  leopards,  and  it  will  be  a  horrible  sight.  To  say  nothing  of  the  expense  incurred  by  the  loss."   XTEVERTHELESS,  they  determined  to  try  ■*-^*it.  Dozens  of  armed  guards  were  placed  about  the  huge,  open  arena,  watching  and  ready  for  the  horrible  slaughter.  Friends  who  had  been  told  of  the  event,  slipped  out  to  the  place  stealthily.  Keepers  spoke  in  whispers.  It  was  a  dreaded  and  fearful  event.  At  last,  every-  thing was  ready.  Now.  The  signal.  Out  sprang  a  male  lion,  a  tiger,  a  female  lion,  a  male  tiger,  a  leopard,  a  panther,  more  lions,  more  tigers,  more  leopards.   The  silence  was  thick.  A  female  lion  slunk  over  to  a  ferocious  male.  There  was  a  mo-  ment of  suspense.  Suddenly,  she  lifted  a  paw.  Tap.  Ever  so  gently  she  tapped  his  ear.  Sur-  prised, he  turned  and  looked  at  her.  Again  she  lifted  her  paw.    Tap.    Nothing  happened.   Tap.  But  the  male  lion,  utterly  bored,  uttered  a  long,  loud  raspberry  and  strolled  off.  Two  other  lions  were  rolling  about  like  kit-  tens. A  tiger  yawned  openly  and  sprawled  out  for  a  nap.  A  panther  sat,  blinking  at  a  leopard.   Who  blinked  back.  And  a  half  hour  later,  the  armed  guards  awoke  the  beasts,  who  had  fallen  asleep  by  this  time,  and  returned  them  to  their  cages.    Heigh  ho.   Over  on  "The  Big  Cage"  set  at  Universal,  a  weary  looking  assistant  director  strolled  by.    "What's  the  matter,  Jack?"  a  friend  asked.  "You  don't  seem  well."   "I'm  all  right,"  he  replied,  "but  I'm  tired.  I  don't  sleep  well.  You  see,  since  we  switched  from  actors  to  animals  in  Hollywood,  my  wife  won't  let  me  in  the  house.  I  smell  up  the  cur-  tains. So  she  takes  the  dog  in  the  house  at  night,  and  I  sleep  in  the  dog  house."   A  well-known  actor  suddenly  found  him-  self out.  His  option  hadn't  been  taken  up.  "Haven't  I  been  making  money  for  you?"  he  demanded  of  the  producer.   "Yes,  you  have,  my  boy.  But,  you  see,  we  wanted  to  renew  the  option  on  the  turtle  and  we  just  couldn't  afford  you  both.  You  know  how  it  is,  old  fellow."   In  a  scene  for  "King  of  the  Jungle,"  a  fire  was  to  break  out  in  a  circus,  causing  a  fearful  pandemonium  among  the  men  and  beasts.  "Watch  out,"  they  warned,  "the  fire  will  drive  the  lions  to  a  mad  frenzy."   All  was  ready.  Torches  were  applied.  Flames  shot  out.  People  ran  screaming  for  their  lives,  the  lions  sprang  from  their  open  cages,  reached  the  fire  and  calmly  and  deliber-  ately sat  down  on  it.   T"X  THEN  the  flames  grew  too  warmish,  they  ***  merely  moved  over  to  another  spot.  Not  quite  so  hot.  It  took  three  Los  Angeles  fire  companies  to  get  the  lions  off  the  fire.  But,  for  two  weeks  after,  they  could  only  shoot  the  fronts  of  the  lions.  The  rears  were  singed  beyond  photographing.   Vince  Barnett  was  playing  a  part  with  the  tigers.  "Vince,"  a  friend  said  one  day,  "Why  do  you  wear  that  peculiar  striped  sweater?"   Vince  called  him  aside.  "If  you  really  want  to  know,"  he  said,  "I'm  yessing  the  tigers."   A  certain  scene  in  "The  Big  Cage"  calls  for  a  tiger  to  leap  over  the  arena  and  land  in  a  smaller  cage.  Everything  was  ready.  Cameras  set,  lights  placed  and  the  tiger  properly  prodded.  Enraged,  he  leaped,  but  instead  of  landing  in  the  cage,  he  lit  squarely  on  the  calliope.  The  jar  set  it  going.  It  blasted  out,  "Over  the  Fence  Is  Out — Pop."  The  tiger  flew  twenty  feet  in  the  air  and  landed  squarely  back  on  the  calliope  that  let  out  another  "Over  the  Fence  Is  Out — Pop"  and  again  the  tiger  leaped  until,  well,  it  was  a  riot.   But  the  prize  of  all  the  animal  stars  goes  to  Blue  Boy,  the  prize  hog  of  "State  Fair."  A  nine  hundred  pound  boar  hog,  for  weeks,  Blue  Boy  was  the  star  attraction  of  the  Fox  lot.  A  group  of  visitors  from  the  East  were  being  shown  about  the  lot.  "Now,  who  would  you  like  to  see?"  they  were  asked.  "Sally  Eilers  or  Jimmie  Dunn?"  "Oh,"  one  lady  gurgled,  "if  you  don't  mind,  I'd  rather  see  Blue  Boy.    I  hear  he  has  such  soulful  eyes."   Reporters  were  wild  about  him.  Hanging  about  his  pen  for  hours.  While  divorces  and  scandals  passed  by  unnoticed.   "Listen,"  a  famous  star  stormed  in  the  publicity  office,  "what's  the  matter  with  you?  I  haven't  had  any  publicity  for  six  weeks."   "What,"  shrieked  the  publicity  man,  "you  come  up  here  demanding  publicity  when  we've  got  a  nine  hundred  pound  hog  on  the  lot?    Who  do  you  think  you  are?"   A  DIETITIAN  was  hired  who  carefully  looked  after  Blue  Boy's  diet.  A  beautician  was  actually  hired  to  prepare  his  lovely  face  and  form  for  the  camera.  And  when  the  picture  was  over,  they  decided  a  college  education  was  all  Blue  Boy  needed  to  set  the  world  on  fire.  So  he  was  enrolled  at  the  California  Polytechnic  Institute  at  San  Luis  Obispo.   Several  days  ago,  a  young  director  jauntily  entered  the  Brown  Derby,  bowing  to  friends  from  right  to  left.   Suddenly,  as  he  raised  his  sandwich  to  his  lips,  a  horrible  look  came  into  his  eyes.  His  face  grew  wan  and  pale.   Nick,  the  waiter,  rushed  over.  "What's  the  matter,  sir?"  he  demanded.   "Nick,  look,  I  can't  eat  that  sandwich.  You  hear  me.  I  can't  eat  it.  How  do  I  know  it  might  not  contain  my  favorite  movie  star?"   And,  weeping  and  wailing,  they  led  him  out.    XXave  You  A  BOY  FRIEND  WHO  NEEDS  A  JOB?

He  has  been  in  pictures  since  1926.  During  the  past  year  he  has  ap-  peared in  "Up  for  Murder,"  "Bad  Company,"  "Murder  at  Midnight,"  "The  Famous  Fergu-  son Case,"  and  "By  Whose  Hand?"  His  latest  is  "Lawyer  Man."  Ken  is  a  native  of  Pittsburgh,  Penna.  He  is  5  feet,  11  inches  tall,  and  has  jet  black  hair  and  brown  eyes.  Had  considerable  stage  experience  before  he  appeared  in  silent  pictures  back  in  1926.   Betty  D.  Conolly,  Powell  River,  B.

It's  Southern,  Johnny  being  a  native  of  Alabama.  He  was  born  in  Dothan,  Ala.,  just  28  years  ago.  Is  6  feet  tall,  weighs  165  and  has  black  hair  and  brown  eyes.

Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933   Screen    Memories    From    Photoplay   15  Years  Ago    (CURIOUSLY,  the  one  notice-  ^-*able  reflection  of  the  war  in  this  issue  was  a  smashing  appeal  to  buy  "smileage  books" — cou-  pon admissions  to  camp  movie  theaters.  Photoplay,  like  every-  one else,  had  passed  the  "talk"  stage,  and  was  buckling  into  the  real  business  of  winning  the  war.   Likewise,  Doug  Fairbanks,  Sr.,  had  just  scooped  in  $40,000  from  San    Franciscans   for   camp   ac-  tivities with  a  rodeo.    Among  the  interested    spectators    were    the  first  M  rs.  Fairbanks  and  a  chubby  boy,    Doug    Jr.     Mary    had    "adopted"    a  regiment  of  field  artillery  at  Camp  Kearney,  and  we  showed  pictures  of  the  loving  cup  the  regiment  presented  to  her.   Among  favored  players  of  the  day,  we  con-  trasted Beverly  Bayne's  "baby  stare"  with  Theda  Bara,  asking  of  the  latter,  "Does  She  Believe  Her  Own  Press  Agent?"  Elliott  Dexter,  who  seems  to  have  been  the  current  Clark  Gable,  broke  down  and  confessed  in  our  pages    about  feminine  stars  he  had   "loved,"  while  we  hinted  at  the   impending    passing    of    another   great    favorite,    Clara    Kimball   Young.    After  growing  big  in  the   business,  it  seems  she  was  doing   likewise  in  the  figure.     Charlie   Chaplin    had    just    spent    some   half-million    dollars    building    a   studio  of  his  own,   to  suit  his   tastes.   Beverly  Young   players   were   not   so   Bayne  much  on  the  up-and-up  in  those   war-starved  days.    We  did  have   room,  however,  for  pats  on  the   back   to  Jack   Holt  in   "Loaded   Dice"  and   Lionel  Atwill's  attempt,  in  "Eve's  Daughter,"   to  do  wrong  by  Billie  Burke.     Fortunately,   noble  Tom  Meighan  intervened.   Admirers  of  Johnny  Weissmuller  may  be  interested  to  know  that  Tarzan,  done  by  Elmo  Lincoln,  was  described  at  some  length  in  this  issue.  Ethel  Barrymore  also  had  provided  a  thrill  for  her  admirers  with  a  rendition  of  "Camille."     Gail  Kane  on  cover.    10  Years  Ago    IN  our  opinion,  the  big  news  of  May,  1923,  was  the  release  of  "The  Covered  Wagon"  —  the  same  film  later  voted  by  Photo-  play readers  the  best  of  the  year.  So  enthusiastic  were  we  that  the  opening  page  of  the  issue  urged  everyone  to  see  it.   This  film,  of  course,  was  credited  largely  to  Jimmy  Cruze's  direction.  Of  those  in  the  cast,  headed  by  J.  Warren  Lois   Kerrigan,  the  names  still  seen  in  Wilson   current  productions  are  two-  Lois  Wilson  and  Ernest  Tor-  rence.  Of  those  featured  in  the  other  five  best  for  the  month,  Ramon  Novarro  and  Marion  Davies  are  active,  while  Huntly  Gordon  has  a  part  in  Mary  Pickford's  current  "Secrets."  Of  the  others,  Walter  Hiers  later  died  at  the  height  of  his  fame,  and  the  rest  are  just  missing.   Mary  and  Doug  were  married  by  now,  and  we  showed  them  attending  a  motion  picture  circus  in  Los  Angeles — an  event  featured  by  a    race  between  Jack  Pickford,  Douglas  MacLean  and  Reginald  Denny,  mounted  respectively  on  an  ostrich,  a  donkey  and  a  camel.  Ruth  Clifford  was  quite  a  current  rage,  and  Ruth  Roland,  of  serial  fame,  was  busily  tuck-  ing her  money  into  Los  Angeles  real  estate.   Family  news  told  of  Barbara  La  Marr  (we  called  her  "orchid-  aRious")  adopting  a  baby.   Viola  Dana,  current  flapper,  though  a  widow,  was  populariz-  ing her  phrase,  "Be  Yourself";  while  among  newer  players,  Mae  Busch  had  reached  stardom  in  "The  Christian."  Norma  Shearer  was  pictured  a  la  circus  equestrienne,  and  we  said  of  her,  "attractive  enough  to  win  a  place  for  herself."  An  interesting  item  in  the  "History  of  the  Movies"  then  running,  related  that  July  14,  1908,  all  a-tremble,  D.  W.  Griffith  sneaked  into  a  New  York  movie  house  to  see  how  his  first  effort  at  producing  went  over.   The  cover — Lois  Wilson.    5  Years  Ago    y.\Y,  1928— a  relatively   •'•'•'■peaceful   month   in   cinema   circles,    as    peace    goes.      That   stormy  petrel  of  the  films,  Pola   Negri,  was  ending  an  $8,000  a   week  contract,  and  was  said  to   be     hesitating     between     three   offers  at  her  new  figure — $10,000   a  week.     (That  docs  sound  like   five  years  ago!)    As  big  news  as   any  was  the  fact  that  Charlie   Farrell  was  stepping  about  with  Barbara   Virginia  Valli.  La  Marr   Mute  and  sorrowful  testimony  to  the  rapid  tempo  of  change  in  Hollywood:  The  boy,  whose  adoption  by  Barbara  La  Marr  was  chronicled  five  years  before,  now  has  been  taken  by  ZaSu  Pitts —  because  of  his  adopted  mother's  death.  Holly-  wood likewise  was  agog  over  the  business  of  finding  a  successor  to  Jackie  Coogan,  the  rage  of  five  years  before.  We  submitted  pictures  and  the  question  whether  one  Master  Freddie  Frederick  might  not  be  the  heir  to  the  vacated  Coogan  throne.    We  had  quite  a  splash  upon  another  engaging  new  personality  — director   Eric   Von   Stroheim,  called  by  us  "Hollywood's  one  real  genius."    Another  genius —  Greta  Garbo — in  her  autobiog-  raphy told  how,  as  part  of  her  progress    in    Sweden,    she    pro-  cured the  lead  of  a  film  which  made  a  hit  in  Berlin.     This,    it  seems,   was  enough   for  Holly-  wood— for  Louis  B.  Mayer  an-  nexed her  on  a  contract,  and  the  end  of  the  installment   told  of  her  quiet  arrival  in  New  York.  Kathryn  Carver  rated  two  pages  of  pictures,  because    for   her   honeymoon    in    Paris    with  Adolphe   Menjou,   she   had   chosen   to   "buy  Hollywood"  as  to  trousseau.   Among  newer  players  we  fancied  Anita  Page.  We  also  related  how  Jean  Hersholt's  work  in  "Abie's  Irish  Rose"  had  won  him  the  accolade  of  stardom  in  Griffith's  "The  Battle  of  the  Sexes."  The  cover  picture— ah,  a  novelty!     Greta  Garbo.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  May,  1933    I  I  I    Addresses    of  the   Stars    Hollywood,  Calif.

"Coat,  with  Dietrich  shoulders;   "Vest,  with  deep  Garbo  V;   "Trousers,  with  Hepburn  flare."   And  did  the  crowd  gather?   T_TERE'S  a  real  true  story  that's  stranger  ■*■-*■  than  fiction.  Remember  "Baby  Marie"  Osborne?  She  was  one  of  the  screen's  first  stars.  She  made  a  fortune,  then  lost  it  trying  to  produce  her  own  pictures.  Then  she  went  to  work  in  the  five  and  ten  cent  store.   She  married  Frank  Dempsey  and  a  child  was  born  to  them  a  few  months  ago.  Then  Frank  lost  his  job.  They  went  to  live  with  the  Osbornes.  Out  of  the  silver  lining  behind  their  cloud  came  news  of  a  large  inheritance  set  aside  by  H.  L.  Shriver,  a  wealthy  Wash-  ington, Pa.  engineer,  for  Marie.  So  the  story  found  its  climax  like  that  of  any  movie  when  it  was  learned  Baby  Marie  was  not  the  child  of  the  Osbornes,  but  the  daughter  of  Shriver  who  had  left  her  in  a  Colorado  orphanage  years  ago.   TS  it  true — those  rumors  that  Marlene  Die-  trich and  Maurice  Chevalier  are  no  longer  so  friendly?    It's  hard  to  believe.    Maurice  is    a  friend  not  only  of  Marlene  but  of  her  hus-  band. Remember  how  the  Frenchman  posed  with  the  Dietrich  family,  even  at  the  station,  when  hubby  was  departing?   And  can  it  be  that  Chevalier's  supposed  interest  in  Lilian  Harvey  has  anything  to  do  with  it?   What  a  riot  this  newcomer  Lilian  is  causing  ■ — a  long  line  including  every  other  bachelor  in   town  seems  to  be  waiting  for  an  inning.   PLY  CULBERTSON  is  surely  having  a  hard  time  convincing  Hollywood  that  his  "sys-  tem" is  any  good.  Currently  making  a  bridge  short,  he  has  "grand  slammed"  two  super-  visors, three  directors,  five  cameramen  and  all  kinds  of  executives.  It  seems  that  Ely  has  ideas,  not  only  about  bridge,  but  about  making  movies.   But — he  just  couldn't  see  his  way  clear  to  play  the  Marx  Brothers,  could  he?

That's  how  most  of  her  followers  feel  about  Polly  Moran  quitting  movies  for  personal  appearances  in  vaudeville  and  radio.  Her  departure  from  the  lot  severs  one  of  the  most  humorous  teams  in  moviedom  and  Marie  Dressier  feels  it  keenly.   XTINTETT  SUNDERLAND,  who,  in  case  you  don't  know,  is  really  Mrs.  Walter  Huston,  is  playing  her  first  picture  part  in  "Sweepings" — and  that's  Lionel  Barrymore's  film,  not  Walter's.

ILLUSION:   A  roaring  fire  was  built  in  an  oven... the  temperature  rose  to  600°  F.  Into  the  oven  walked  the  "fire"  king,  M.  Chabert,  carrying  several  raw  steaks.  A  few  minutes  later  the  doors  were  flung  wide  and  out  he  stepped. . . safe  and  sound. . .  with  the  steaks  thoroughly  cooked.   EXPLANATION:   Heat  rises.  When  Chabert  en-  tered the  oven  he  hung  the  steaks  above  the  fire,  then  dropped  to  the  floor  at  the  side,  covering  his  head  with  a  hood  made  from  his  shirt.

Plenty  of  attractive  men  came  her  way.  Why  did  they  never  ask  her  out — or  at  least  not  more  than  once?  If  she  only  knew ! . . .  If  only  someone  would  tell  her!  .  .  .  But  of  course  no  one  did.   *  *  *   Actual  tragedy  can  enter  a  girl's  life  through  halitosis  (unpleasant  breath)  —  and  without  her  ever  suspecting  she  has  it.  That  is  the  insidious  thing  about  it.  You  cannot  know,  yourself,  when  the  breath    is  offensive,  and  your  most  intimate  friends  won't  tell  you.  Yet  it  is  a  scien-  tific fact  that  practically  everyone  has  halitosis  now  and  again.   You  cannot  avoid  it.  But  you  can  cor-  rect it— by  gargling  and  rinsing  the  mouth  with  Listerine.  Every  morning.  Every  evening.  And  between  times  be-  fore every  social  engagement.   Listerine  immediately  stops  fermenta-  tion in  the  mouth— the  cause  of  90%  of  all  cases  of  unpleasant  breath.  Listerine  overcomes  the  odors  at  once.  There  is  ab-  solutely nothing  like  it  for  the  purpose.  Clinical  tests  have  shown  that  Listerine  instantly  conquers  mouth  odors  that  ordi-  nary mouth  washes  cannot  hide  in  12  hours!  Begin  this  very  day  with  Lister-  ine. It  is  refreshing.  It  cannot  harm  teeth  or  gums.  It  is  the  safe  antiseptic  with  the  pleasant  taste.  And  it  ends  the  awful  risk  of  halitosis!

And  certainly  no  harsh  foods.    Her  gums  are  inactive,  tender — and  the  "pink"  on  her  tooth  brush  signals  danger.    She  may  be  tired  from  too  much  activity.    But  her  gums  are  unhealthy  from  too  little  activity.    They  need  Ipana  and  massage.    Tm    OU  aren't  safe  from   "Pink  Tooth  Brush,"  either!    AS  a  child,  you  had  firm  gums.  Nature  /  A.  saw  to  that.   But  whether  you  were  fed  from  a  silver  service  or  an  earthenware  bowl — whether  a  trained  nurse  supervised  your  diet,  or  an  over-worked  mother  prepared  your  food  with  her  own  hands — you  ate  the  softest  of  foods.  You  have  continued  to  eat  soft  foods.   Crusts,  crunchy  grains,  tough  meats,  and  other  harsh  foods  have  practically  disappeared  from  the  American  diet.

But  these  foods  do  not  exercise  the  gums.  So  your  gums  first  become  lazy  and  slug-  gish. Soon  they  are  weak-walled  and  tender.  They  deteriorate  until  you  find  a  trace  of  "pink"  upon  your  tooth  brush.   This  condition  is  called  "pink  tooth  brush."  It  is  serious.  It  may  be  the  fore-  runner of  gingivitis,  Vincent's  disease,  and  even  the  feared  (though  infrequent)  pyor-  rhea.   It  may  even  endanger  sound  teeth.   To  regain  their  healthy  firmness,  your  gums  need  assistance.    Your  dentist  will    explain  that  they  need  massage.   Clean  your  teeth  with  Ipana.  Further:  put  a  little  extra  Ipana  on  your  brush  and  rub  it  into  your  gums.   Why  massage  with  Ipana?  Because  Ipana  contains  an  ingredient  known  as  ziratol.  This  a  ids  in  stimulating  circulation  through  the  gum  walls.  The  walls  become  firm  again.   Use  Ipana  with  massage  regularly,  and  your  teeth  will  be  beautifully  clean  and  bright.  Your  gums  will  improve  rapidly.

Copyright,  1933,  by  the  Photoplay  Publishing  Company,  Chicago    Ike  Audi    lence    lalks  Dack    In  "42nd  Street,"  Ruby  Keeler,  who  heads  this  line  under  George  Stone's  coaching,  plays  a  chorus  girl  who  crashes  through  to  fame  in  one  show.  "42nd  Street"  was  Ruby's  first  film — and  what  a  hit!  She  went  over  those  movie  barriers  like  the  British  fliers  over  Mt.  Everest    THE  $25  LETTER   Why  must  motion  pictures,  newest  and  finest  of  the  dramatic  arts,  rush  each  year  to  the  boards  of  Broadway  to  select  next  season's  films?   Pictures  depend,  not  on  reproducing  the  legitimate  stage,  but  on  creating  an  art  vastly  different  and  possibly  superior.  Color  and  artistic  photography  lie  at  the  cinema  pro-  ducer's door  alone.  Possibilities  for  fantasy,  spectacle,  grand  sets,  clever  lighting,  travel  are  in  his  grasp.  The  world's  best  players  are  his  instruments  and  he  chooses  to  produce  prosaic  novels  and  stilted  plays.   Only  when  the  picture  producers  create  can  they  be  called  artists.  The  actors  have  had  to  carry  the  burden  too  long.  So  here's  to  a  new  art  and  greater  cinema  world!   Robert  Downing,  Cedar  Rapids,  Iowa.   THE  $10  LETTER   The  vitality  of  the  movies  must  be  bound-  less, else  how  could  they  stand  up  under  the  barrage  of  unfair  criticism  that  is  constantly  being  hurled  in  their  direction?   Because  little  Mary  IJones,  aged  seven,  is  somewhat  jittery  after  seeing  "Frankenstein,"  Mary's  mother  immediately  writes  a  letter  denouncing  all  movies  as  having  an  evil  in-  fluence on  children.  The  real  trouble,  of  course,  lies  in  Mrs.  Jones,  who  should  super-  vise Mary's  movie  consumption  as  carefully  as  she  does  her  diet.   And  so  it  goes,  the  movies  bearing  the  bl  ime  for  everything  from  Willie's  bad  manners  to  grandma's  rheumatism.   In  other  phases  of  life  we  take  the  bad  with  the  good  without  too  much  complaint.  Why  in  the  name  of  common  sense  can't  we  apply  this  philosophy  to  the  movies,  also?   Lovise  Latura,  Memphis,  Tenn.   6    THE  $5  LETTER   Xew  faces!  Glowing  youth  and  beauty.  I  suppose  we  must  have  them  for  the  younger  generation,  but  somehow  we  miss  our  own  favorites  of  former  days — Lillian  Gish,  Norma  Talmadge,  Maurice  Costello  and  the  others.  What  a  whale  of  a  difference  a  few  wrinkles  make  in  this  glorious,  yet  tragic  profession!   It  makes  one  realize  what  a  good  loser  one  has  to  be  to  enter  the  movie  field.  A  few  years  of  fame,  success  and  the  height  of  pop-  ularity— and  then— what  a  terrible  feeling  it  must  be  when  fan  mail  drops  off,  when  con-  tracts are  not  renewed  and  one  is  lost  in  the  fog  of  oblivion.   Personally,  I'd  much  rather  be  a  store-  keeper or  a  minister,  where  Father  Time  is  not  so  cruel  in  relieving  one  of  his  duties.   E.  B.  Hill,  Hornell,  N.  Y.    SO  "42nd  Street"  leaps  to  the  front  and  heads  the  entire  parade.  And  Ruby  Keeler!  Yum,  yum,  how  they  love  that  girl!  From  practically  no  letters  last  month,  to  leader  in  our  mail  this  time — that  is  something!  The  Bouquets  this  month  tell  why.   "State  Fair"  has  struck  deep,  with  its  message  of  contentment  and  peace  in  simple  surroundings;  while  "Cav-  alcade" is  running  strong,  and  "Ras-  putin" is  coming  up.  One  writer  asks  about  this  film:  "Is  it  possible  to  have  too  much  star?"  She  means  the  three  spectacular  Barrymores!   Two  of  our  recent  articles — "Which  Movie  Star  Dominates  You?"  and  "Is  the  Garbo  Rage  Over?"  still  provoke  extended  discussion.  "No  man  dom-  inates me,"  one  girl  writes  haughtily.    When  the  audience  speaks  the  stars  and  producers  listen.  We  offer  three  prizes  for  the  best  letters  of  the  month — $25,  $10  and  $5.  Literary  ability  doesn't  count.  But  candid  opinions  and  constructive  sugges-  tions do.

"42nd  Street"  with  its  abundance  of  enter-  taining glamour,  fairly  picked  me  up  out  of  my  seat  and  knocked  me  down  for  the  "count."   I  was  so  utterly  thrilled  with  its  beautiful  settings  and  clever  routines  that  I  stayed  to  see  it  twice.  After  the  picture  came  to  a  dramatic  close  for  the  second  time,  I  was  brought  back  to  earth  by  the  realization  that  there  were  gnawing  pains  of  hunger  inside.  How  happy  I'd  have  been  if  I  could  have  nibbled  upon  the  top  of  the  seat  in  front  of  me  and  then,  appeased,  lose  myself  in  the  glory  of  a  third  performance!  Cheers  for  "42nd  Street!"  Let's  have  more  like  it.  Etheldreda  McDonough,  Pittsburgh,  Pa.   Just  recently  I  saw  "42nd  Street"  and  did  I  enjoy  it!  There's  a  picture  fast  moving  and  entertaining.  When  you  watched  that  chorus  backstage  you  could  readily  see  that  those  acting  the  parts  had  done  some  heavy  re-  hearsing themselves.  Warner  Baxter  made  a  director  who  will  make  some  girls  hesitate  be-  fore they  decide  on  being  chorines.  I  never  dreamed  of  how  hard  such  a  life  could  be.  My  eyes  are  opened  now,  thanks  to  Warner  Bros.   Ida  J.  AiF.R,  Chicago,  111.   A  new  picture  personality,  a  new  star  born  and  does  she  twinkle?  Verily,  from  her  scintillating  eyes,  to  the  tips  of  her  dance  mad  feet — she  twinkles.  Ruby  Keeler  in  "42nd  Street. "  We  don't  wonder  that  Al  Jolson  sings  like  thai,  with  Ruby  for  an  inspiration.  Hail  Queen  Ruby!   Mrs.  Marvin  M.  Gray,  Palmyra,  Mo.   ABOUT  THOSE  DOMINATING  STARS   Your  article,  "Which  Movie  Star  Dominates  You?"  has  more  truth  than  poetry.   I  married  a  rough,  tough  he-man.  But  I  dominated  him.  I  knew  it,  so  did  he.  Now  I  am  a  divorcee.  Yet  the  same  type  of  man,  to  a  certain  extent,  appeals  to  me.  Johnny  Weiss-  muller  and  Gary  Cooper.    I  adore  them.   Johnny  has  the  most  beautiful  body  in  the  movies.  Maybe  he  makes  us  sex  conscious,  I  don't  know.  But  I  get  a  thrill  looking  at  him.  And  Gary  Cooper  has  that  "you  can't  win  me"  air  that  arouses  a  desire  to  show  them.  Yet  neither  is  handsome.   I  want  a  masterful  man  who  is  also  romantic  and  an  idealist,  and  yet  I  want  to  dominate.  I  want  him  to  have  Gary  Cooper's  indifference  to  all  women  but  me,  Johnny  Weissmuller's  body  and  Leslie  Howard's  culture  and  ideals.  Is  there  such  a  man?   Mrs.  Alyce  Bateman1,  Zanesville,  O.   You  ask  who  of  the  screen  dominates  me.  Most  any  of  my  friends,  relatives  or  acquaint-  ances could  tell  you  as  it  has  been  the  same  person  ever  since  his  first  appearance  in  the  movies  in  "The  White  Sister."  Why  they  put  Clark  Gable  in  the  talkie  version  is  beyond  my  comprehension.

His  pictures  are  too  few  and  far  apart  to  suit  me.  But  what  can  I  do  about  it?   Ora  Jane  Hollman,  Kansas  City,  Mo.   "BACK  TO  THE  FARM"  WITH  "STATE  FAIR"   Hail  to  "State  Fair."  It's  such  a  vivid  painting  of  rural  life  that  it's  like  a  refresh-  ing breath  of  clover-laden  country  air.   This  colorful  comedy-drama  with  Janet  Gay-  nor  and  Will  Rogers  at  their  very  best,  ob-  scured sky-scrapers  and  gangdom,  undressed  sirens  and  murderers,  bank  holidays  and  bare  cupboards,  and  carried  me  back  to  thrilling  State  Fair  days  of  my  own  youth.   With  real  vacations  so  few  this  summer,  I'm  for  more  pictures  like  "State  Fair."   A.  M.  Comsienator,  Detroit,  Mich.   We,  of  the  farms,  have  long  hours  of  toil,  very  little  money  and  few  amusements.  And  so,  in  behalf  of  the  farm  people,  allow  me  to  express  our  appreciation  for  "State  Fair. "   A  few  days  ago,  I  rode  into  town,  sold  my  basket  of  eggs  and  wandered  into  a  movie  house.  "State  Fair"  was  being  shown  and  it  fully  made  up  to  me  for  my  keen  disappoint-  ment of  last  fall  when  I  was  unable  to  attend  our  own  State  Fair  in  Milwaukee.  I  thrilled  with  Miss  Gaynor  on  the  dizzy  roller  coaster.  I  enjoyed  the  side  shows,  I  tasted  the  hot  buttered  pop  corn  and  quenched  my  thirst  with  the  ice  cold  pop,  and  all  for  the  small  sum  of  twenty-five  cents  or  one  dozen  of  eggs.

GARBO'S   ADMIRERS    SPEAK   UP   I  was  annoyed  and  frightened  when  I  glimpsed  "Is  the  Garbo  Rage  Over?"  on  your    April  cover — annoyed  because  you  referred  to  the  public's  appreciation  of  Miss  Garbo  as  a  rage,  and  frightened  because  if  it  were  true  we  would  be  doomed  to  a  bleak  and  dismal  Garbo-  less  future.  My  resentment  gave  way  to  relief  after  I  read  the  article,  for  I  thought  I  rec-  ognized in  you  a  sort  of  "kindred  spirit."   In  January  our  local  morning  newspaper  printed  an  article  in  the  editorial  section  en-  titled "We  Want  Garbo."  Fort  Wayne  is  the  second  city  in  Indiana  and  is  widely  known  as  a  theatrical  town.  Only  one  other  cinema  celebrity  has  ever  been  paid  a  like  tribute  by  this  paper — that  inimitable  genius,  Lionel  Barrymore.   When  Fort  Wayne  announces  by  way  of  an  editorial  (after  all  these  months  of  Garbo's  absence)  that  "We  Want  Garbo,"  now  isn't  that  something,  I  ask  you?   If  that  makes  me  a  Garbo-maniac,  bring  on  the  padded  cell.  Geraldixe  Frederick,  Fort  Wayne,  Ind.   The  only  way  in  which  the  Garbo  rage  can  be  over  is  that  it  has  deepened  from  an  hysterical  hubbub  over  a  movie  actress  mean-  ing sex  into  a  sincere  and  no  less  devout  appreciation  of  an  artist  meaning  genius.  I  go  to  Vanderbilt  University.   It  has  been  my  observation  that  those  people,  whose  intelligence  and  taste  I  think  most  of,  deem  Greta  Garbo  the  greatest  actress  of  the  screen.   The  more  enlightened  of  the  movie-going  public  demand  that  she  come  back.   P.  N.  B.,  Nashville,  Tenn.   I  bought  the  magazine  this  month  to  read  "Is  the  Garbo  Rage  Over."  Yes  it  is,  as  over  and  dead  as  Jimmy  Walker.  After  she  "ban  go  home"  we  received  Helen  Hayes.   Let  Garbo  stay  home,  and  build  up  Hepburn,  who  is  better  looking  and  far  and  away  a  better  actress.   Mrs.  Celeste  Davey,  Coronado,  Calif.    WON'T    THAT    BE    SOMETHING!   Well,  well,  well — and  now  it  would  seem  the  vogue  is  for  animal  pictures.   What  a  relief  thai  is.   Wild  animals  instead  of  wild  women.   Great  apes  instead  of  the  genus  Homo  adonis.  Thank  heavens  they  haven't  as  yet  dug  up  a  wise-cracking  hippopotamus  or  a  sophisticated  elephant.   But  I  suppose  they  will.   They  gave  King  Kong  a  yen  for  a  blonde —  and  it's  only  a  question  of  Directorial  Time  before  they  inject  the  eternal  triangle  into  the  love-life  of  a  couple  of  alligators.   Hugo  E.  Jung,  No.  Hollywood,  Calif.   REVEALING  THE  ROMANOFFS   "Rasputin  and  the  Empress"  was  actually  a  picture  that  helped  to  solve  many  problems  concerning  the  days  of  Rasputin's  reign.  I  am  so  proud  to  say  it  has  cleared  my  mind  on  things  which  were  always  a  mystery  to  me.   I  have  read  many  books  on  this  particular  subject,  and  although  I  have  done  so,  I  could  never  get  a  good  idea  of  the  meaning  until  I  saw  it  on  the  screen.   The  directors  were  most  accurate  in  select-  ing the  characters  for  such  a  noble  picture.  The  Barrymores  cannot  be  surpassed  in  this  type  of  acting.   Evelyn  Watt,  Greensburg,  Penna.    The  queen  sails  to  re-ascend  her  throne  and  her  faithful  subjects  are  all  for  her.  Garbo  was  as  mysterious  in  her  sailing  on  an  obscure  steamer  to  California  as  she  was  as  a  spy  in  "Mata  Hari."  It  is  an  occasion  of  rejoicing.  We  welcome  home  Your  Majesty!     Long   live   the   Queen!    What  You  Think  of  Pictures  and  Stars    TOO  MUCH  STARLIGHT?   I  wonder  if  anyone  else  found  the  same  difficulty  with  the  marvelous  picture  "Ras-  putin and  the  Empress"  that  I  did.  Keeping  in  mind  the  various  members  of  the  Romanoff  family  wouldn't  have  been  so  difficult  except  that  I  was  so  aware  of  that  other  royal  family,  the  House  of  Barrymore.   Since  the  Barrymores  are  so  well-known  and  as  well  established  institutions  as  the  5  and  10  Stores,  Babe  Ruth  and  the  Notre  Dame  football  team,  it  is  very  hard  to  con-  centrate on  the  Imperial  court  as  one  ought.  Instead  one  is  bound  to  compare  the  voices  and  acting  of  the  respective  Barrymores.   The  Barrymores  forever,  I  say,  but  if  it's  all  the  same  to  Hollywood,  let's  have  them  one  at  a  time.   Marshall  Mills,  Boston,  Mass.   THEY  LIKE  "CAVALCADE"   It  was  with  considerable  prejudice  that  I  went  to  see  "Cavalcade"  at  our  local  theater,  since  I  find  it  extremely  difficult  as  a  rule,  to  understand  or  sympathize  with  British  char-  acters and  situations.   After  the  first  few  moments,  however,  I  found  myself  completely  carried  away  by  the  production  and  sat  enthralled,  to  the  end.   "Cavalcade"  is  a  picture  which  mirrors  the  hopes,    aspirations,    patriotism    and    human    Concerning  some  players,  comment  is  varied — but  George  Arliss  ad-  mirers agree  on  one  thing.  Everyone  notes  the  finished  artistry  of  his  work,  as  here  when  shaking  hands  with  Patricia  Ellis  in  "The  King's  Vacation."  One  letter  says  it's  joy  even  to  see  him  open  a  cigarette  case    Edna  May  Oliver  holds  a  legion  of  admirers — but  it  seems  that  "The  Penguin  Pool  Murder"  had  some-  thing which  was  particularly  pro-  ductive of  comment.  Many  of  our  readers  thought  that  she  struck  a  high  new  note  in  the  grand  scale  of  mystery  thriller  productions    problems  of  any  race  and  any  time.  Director,  i  writers,  cast  and  technicians  together,  have  given  us  a  production  splendid  in  its  epic  quality,  dramatic  in  its  situations,  intensely  interesting  in  its  problems,  and — above  all —  human  to  the  very  core.   Barry  O'Dell,  Oakland,  Calif.   In  these  times  when  so  many  pictures  are  being  produced  ridiculing  our  National  Gov-  ernment, it  is  surprising  and  astonishing  to  see  such  an  excellent  picture  as  "Cavalcade"  up-  holding the  British  government.  It  is  stupend-  ous in  its  ability  to  show  the  loyalty  of  the  English  people  to  their  country.   But  believe  you  me,  there  is  no  more  loyalty  anywhere  than  that  which  we  Americans  have  for  our  country.  Why  can't  the  producers  do  as  well  for  our  history  as  "Cavalcade"?   And  here's  a  suggestion.  Why  not  give  us  pictures  depicting  the  family  history  of  a  family  in  each  of  the  nations  of  the  world?  It  would  give  Uj  a  better  insight  into  the  habits  and  customs  of  other  lands.   Robert  Allen,  Jr.,  Nashville,  Tenn.   I  hesitate  to  criticize  the  best  pictures,  but  as  a  rule  there  are  many  details  concerning  marine  settings  which  could  be  made  much  more  convincing.   In  artificial  settings  the  action  of  the  water  at  the  side  of  the  ship  is  seldom  convincing.  When  a  real  ship  is  under  weigh,  foam  and  water  are  sliding  by  beyond  the  rail,  and  the  bow  wave  is  widening  out,  to  meet  with  the  other  waves.  While  stateroom  doors  opening  out  on  deck  are  usual  on  many  coastwise  vessels,  they  are  seldom  seen  on  ocean-going  steamers,  except  in  the  movies.  In  "Caval-  cade," where  every  attention  was  paid  to  de-  tail, nevertheless  the  rolling  of  the  "Titanic"  was  too  rapid  for  a  ship  of  her  size,  especially  since  the  motion  must  have  come  from  a  long  ocean  swell,  as  the  picture  showed  a  calm  sea.   Meredith  A.  Scott,  Framingham,  Mass.    THAT'S  PUTTING   IT  OVER,  LEE!   In  "Private  Jones,"  Lee  Tracy  presents  a  typical  American  doughboy  with  the  natural-  ness that  makes  the  character  a  living  person.  To  any  of  us  who  shouldered  a  gun  in  those  distant  days,  Private  Jours  is  a  real  buddy.  We  can  almost  feel  the  cooties  crawling  up  our  back  again,  as  we  join  him  in  his  hectic  ad-  ventures.   Good  work,  Lee!   J.  B.  Sinclair,  San  Francisco,  Calif.   A  CHEER  FOR  ARLISS   If  ever  an  actor  was  born  and  destined  to  be  such,  it  is  George  Arliss,  for  to  my  mind,  he  is  the  most  outstanding  male  personality  on  our  American  stage  or  screen  today.  Youthful  movie  followers  may  have  their  Gable,  Cooper,  Howard,  Fairbanks,  Jr.,  and  their  type,  but  I  am  one  hundred  per  cent  for  George  Arliss.  His  perfect  English,  his  unaffected  nonchalant  air  and  stately  bearing,  fit  him  perfectly  for  playing  the  roles  that  none'othcr  than  he  could  enact  with  such  charm  and  graciousness.   To  watch  intently  his  simple  act  of  closing  a  cigarette  case,  instantly  impresses  one  with  the  fact  that  he  is  an  artist  to  his  very  finger-  tips. Who  among  our  younger  heroes  of  the  screen  will  ever  rise  to  his  supreme  heights?  Millie  Irwin,  Harmon-On-Hudson,  N.  Y.   "THE  SIGN  OF  THE  CROSS"   I  am  a  minister  of  the  gospel  and  a  movie  devotee,  too,  if  you  please.  I  studied  about  the  reign  of  Nero  in  the  seminary,  but  how  much  more  vivid  the  story  becomes  after  seeing  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross"!   I  have  no  patience  with  the  clergy  that  condemn  the  whole  industry  because  of  a  few  pictures  that  may  seem  a  little  off-color.  Charles  Conrad,  Captain  Chaplain  U.  S.  Army,  (Res.)  [  please  turn  to  page  10  ]    What  the  Audience  Thinks    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  9  ]    Mother  has  been  one  of  these  "movie  knockers."  Several  evenings  ago  we  took  her  to  see  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross."  She  was  agreeably  surprised — both  as  to  settings  and  players,  whom  she  thought  were  marvelous.  Now  she  is  thoroughly  convinced  that  movies  are  all  right.   Judith  Walline,  Holdrege,  Neb.   Claudette  Colbert  and  Fredric  March  were  wonderful  lovers  in  "Tonight  Is  Ours."  Their  love  was  beautiful  and  fascinating!   Later,  I  saw  them  in  "The  Sign  of  the  Cross."  It  was  a  great  picture,  but  I  was  disappointed  in  the  feeling  between  Fredric  March  and  Claudette  Colbert.  Turning  from  a  romantic  lover  in  one  picture  to  a  disin-  terested male  in  another  ruined  the  entire  film  for  me.   Producers,  please  don't  make  the  mistake  again  of  having  two  lovers  from  one  picture  become  enemies  in  another.   Ruth  Mac  Nelley,  Delmar,  N.  Y.   HOW  MANY  AGREE?   Greta  Garbo  is  .exotic — Myrna  Loy  is  seductive — Joan  Crawford  in  provocative —  Norma  Shearer  is  delightful — and  Edna  May  Oliver  is  delicious.   I  hadn't  been  feeling  my  usual  tip-top  self  —with  all  the  depression  and  worries  of  this  day — and  quite  absent-mindedly  I  bought  a  ticket  for  "The  Penguin  Pool  Murder."  Had  I  read  the  title  I  should  never  have  entered  the  theater.  But  the  glory  of  the  movies!  I  heard  a  familiar  voice  say,  "Well — ah — I'm  accepting" — well,  just  to  anticipate  the  be-  ginning of  the  picture,  knowing  that  the  great-  est comedienne  of  them  all,  Edna  May  Oliver,  was  the  heroine — was  enough  to  perk  me  up —  and  it  did!   Here's  to  Oliver,  the  Queen  of  Fun!  Mrs.  Harry  Glueck,  Cincinnati,  O.   SALUTE  TO  TOM  MIX   It  is  with  deep  regret  that  I  read  of  Tom  Mix's  retirement  from  the  screen.  Never  will  I  forget  when  Tom  Mix  came  to  our  town  with  the  circus.  Just  before  his  afternoon  per-  formance a  little  crippled  boy  who  couldn't  go  to  the  circus  received  the  biggest  thrill  of  his  life  in  a  visit  from  Tom  and  Tony.  I  don't  know  what  Tom  said  to  him  but  there  was  a  brighter,  happier  look  on  that  kid's  face  from  that  time  until  he  passed  away  a  few  months  later.   Even  at  the  last  he  would  "buck  up  and  laugh"  because  "his  good  friend  Tom  Mix"  said  that  was  the  way  to  do.   A  great  man  in  a  great  industry,  Tom  Mix.  Celeste  B.  Martin,  Clarksdale,  Miss.   FIRST  AID  FOR  EDUCATORS   When  the  talkies  first  came  to  town,  a  great  deal  of  fun  was  poked  at  the  young  screen  actors  for  their  mad  scramble  to  learn  perfect  English.  However,  after  all  is  said  and  done,  I  have  noticed  this — the  young  generation  who  attend  the  talkies  nowadays  speak  far  better  English  than  they  ever  did  before  the  advent  of  the  talkies.   My  young  son  and  daughter,  whose  ruthless  butchery  of  the  English  language  has  for  years  given  me  hot  flashes  and  bitter  regret,  now  correct  my  own  speech  with  disdainful  con-  descension, which  I  accept  with  silent  delight.  If  the  talkies  have  accomplished  nothing  else,  they  have  given  our  young  people  a  new  under-  standing and  appreciation  of  their  mother  tongue!   Mrs.  B.  Fair,  San  Diego,  Calif.   10    Mary's  following,  of  course,  is  de-  lighted to  have  her  back  in  "Se-  crets"— and  one  reader  said  it  was  too  bad  Mary's  mother  had  not  lived  to  see  her  really  "grown  up"  in  pictures.  Leslie  Howard,  too,  pleased,  even  if  not  quite  as  real  a  rancher  as  some  seemed  to  want   Since  Leslie  Howard  in  "The  Animal  King-  dom" told  Myrna  Loy  that  she  was  "alluring,"  radio  announcers  and  other  actors  have  used  the  same  word  with  the  same  enunciation;  and  now  I've  heard  it  in  my  own  Southern  town.   These  foreigners  have  offered  a  challenge  that  isn't  limited  to  actors  and  public  speakers.  I  am  an  English  teacher  in  a  town  where  the  youngsters  have  always  dubbed  as  "sissy"  any  attempt  at  correct  enunciation.  This  present  younger  set,  however,  all  enthusiastic  admirers  of  the  foreign  actors,  speak  better  English  than  any  set  I  have  ever  taught.  Please,  if  only  for  the  sake  of  the  poor,  strug-  gling English  teachers,  don't  let  any  legislation  send  our  foreign  born  actors  home.   Elisabeth  Murphy,  Salisbury,  N.  C.   The  talkies  have  driven  me  to  my  dictionary.  Far  too  many  times,  since  the  advent  of  the  talkies,  I  have  been  not  a  little  surprised  and  embarrassed,  by  some  player  pronouncing  a  word  differently  from  the  way  I  had  always  pronounced  it.  And,  on  rushing  home  and  looking  up  the  word,  I  have  found,  without  exception,  that  my  dictionary  agreed  with  the  player.   My  craving  for  an  extensive  vocabulary  is  almost  an  obsession.  But,  ah  me,  in  my  haste  to  garner  more  and  more  new  mots,  I  failed  to    take  cognizance  of  the  pretty  little  symbols  that  serve  as  guides  to  orthoepy.  I  high-  hatted  all  phonetic  letters  and  diacritical  marks  in  a  shameful  manner.  It  remained  for  the  talkies  to  make  me  seek  an  acquaintance  with  these  afore-scorned  characters.   Ivan  G.  Bedell,  Bloomington,  Ind.   One  curiously  interesting  effect  of  the  movies  on  the  life  and  culture  of  these  times  comes  constantly  to  my  notice.  Teaching  speech  to  groups  of  very  average  young  people  is  never  an  easy  task.  And  yet,  lately,  there  has  been  a  change — a  gradual  one  to  be  sure,  but  increasingly  noticeable.   Broad  "a's"  crop  up  astoundingly,  and  one  or  two  healthy  farm  boys  have  even  gotten  around  to  "eyether!"   It  is  a  good  sign,  and  the  movies  are  re-  sponsible for  it.  Only  today  a  boy  asked  me  if  all  Englishmen  spoke  like  Leslie  Howard,  and  a  girl  hesitatingly  wanted  to  know  if  I  couldn't  teach  her  to  talk  like  Helen  Hayes!  I  had  to  say  "no"  to  both  of  them — and  they  were  very  disappointed.   Agnes  Johnston,  Urbana,  111.   AROUT  ANNOUNCING  CASTS   This  is  the  first  time  I  have  written  to  you  or  any  other  screen  magazine,  but  one  movie  studio  has  conceived  a  very  brilliant  and  inex-  pensive idea  and  I  just  had  to  tell  you  how  fine  I  think  it  is.   The  idea  is  that  of  repeating  the  cast  at  the  end  of  a  picture  under  the  clever  caption  "A  Good  Cast  is  Worth  Repeating.  "   The  usual  trend  at  the  beginning  of  a  picture  is  to  note  the  first  three  or  four  names  of  the  cast  or  to  run  the  eyes  through  the  whole  list  for  familiar  names.  By  this  more  brilliant  method  of  announcing  the  casts  twice,  an  un-  known actor  who  does  his  part  well  is  properly  associated  with  his  name  at  the  end  of  the  picture,  becomes  known  and  is  on  his  way  to  success.   Carmen  K.  Payne,  Detroit,  Mich.   About  two  months  ago  a  picture  was  run  at  our  neighborhood  theater,  which  had  a  clever  way  of  introducing  the  characters.  In  place  of  the  usual  list  of  players,  a  short  section  of  the  picture  was  run  showing  the  player  in  character,  the  name  of  the  character  and  the  name  of  the  player.  This  left  absolutely  no  doubt  as  to  who  was  who.   Earl  J.  Kixgsley,  Portland,  Ore.   THEY  AGREE  ON  JOHN,  ANYWAY   Have  you  seen  "Topaze"?  In  spite  of  John  Barrymore's  other  recent  outstanding  per-  formances (you  know  what  I  mean)  this  seems  to  be  the  one  that  will  make  him  more  popular  than  ever — if  that  be  possible.  It's  one  of  those  few  near-perfect  pictures  that  contain  both  well  directed  cast  and  well  written  con-  tinuity; a  combination  that  makes  you  sit  back  and  really  enjoy  the  complete  performance.  Keen,  amusing  with  very  clever  little  bits —  What?  All  in  one  picture?  Yes,  it's  "Topaze."  Beatrice  Mack,  San  Francisco,  Calif.   Very  much  disappointed  after  taking  in  the  film  "Topaze."  John  Barrymore  as  usual  was  studiously  good,  in  a  scenario  carefully  ar-  ranged to  please  the  American  audience.   It  carries  very  little  resemblance  to  the  play  by  Marcel  Pagnol.   Give  the  public  more  "State  Fairs,"  "If  I  Had  A  Million,"  things  truly  in  the  American  atmosphere.   Leave  foreign  plays  to  those  who  understand  and  like  the  gentle  art  of  philosophy.   Catherine  Larue,  New  York,  N.  Y.    ILLUSION:   In  India,  the  fakirs  present  a  spectacle  to  tourists. Two  lovely  performers  appear,  throw  jag-  ged pieces  of  glass  into  a  box  already  filled  with  broken  glass.  They  step  barefooted  into  the  box  and  do  an  Oriental  dance — uninjured.  EXPLANATION:   Before  appearing  the  perform-  ers toughen  their  feet  in  a  solu-  tion of  alum  water  and  rub  them  with  pulverized  resin.  They  throw  the  sharp  glass  around  the  edges  of  the  platform.  The  glass  on  which  they  actually  do  dance  has  the  edges  rounded  off.  They  just  pretend  to  dance  on  the  sharp  glass.    Copyright,  1933,  R.  J.

One  of  the  tricks  of  cigarette  ad-  vertising is  to  pretend  that"Heat  Treatment"  is  an  exclusive  pro-  cess, making  one  cigarette  better  than  any  other.   EXPLANATION:  All  cigarette  manufacturers  use  heat  treat-  ment. The  first  Camel  cigarette  ever  made,  and  every  one  of  the  billions  of  Camels  produced  since, has  received  the  necessary    heat  treatment.  Harsh,  raw  to-  baccos require  intensive  process-  ing under  high  temperatures.  The  more  expensive  tobaccos,  which  are  naturally  mild,  call  for  only  a  moderate  application  of  heat.   It  is  a  fact,  well  known  by  leaf  tobacco  experts,  that  Camels  are  made  from  finer,  MORE  EXPENSIVE  tobaccos  than  any  other  popular  brand.   Try  Camels.  Judge  them  criti-  cally. Compare  them  with  others  for  mildness,  for  throat-ease,  for  good  taste.  They'll  win  you !

Meals  should  contain  adequate  "bulk"  to  prevent  faulty  elimination.  Otherwise,  skins  may  turn  sallow.  Eyes  become  dull.  Wrinkles  and  pimples  appear.   Searching  laboratory  tests  prove  that  Kellogg's  All-Bran  furnishes  the  required  "bulk" — and  also  supplies  vitamin  B  and  iron.  This  "bulk"  in  All-Bran  is  much  like  that  found  in  leafy  vegetables.   Enjoy  All-Bran  as  a  tasty  cereal  with  milk — or  cook  into  fluffy  bran  muffins,  breads,  waffles,  omelets,  etc.  Two  tablespoonfuls  daily  are  usually  sufficient.  How  much  better  than  tak-  ing patent  medicines — so  often  habit-  forming.   Kellogg's  All-Bran  is  not  fat-  tening.

Name    Address-    Appetizing  Menu  Novelties   To  Test  Your  Culinary  Skill    WHEN  next  you  are  confronted  by  the  problem,  so  common  to  housewives,  of  what  to  serve  that  is  different  from  the  usual  routine,  why  not  try  "Pigs  in  Blanket,"  made  ac-  cording to  Wera  Engels'  German  recipe.   Two  cups  of  mashed  potatoes,  seasoned  with  salt  and  pepper,  should  be  mixed  with  cream  and  one  beaten  egg  to  a  consistency  that  is  not  too  thin.  Scald  small  link  sausages  enough  to  cook  them  through.  Separate  the  links  and  roll  each  single  one  in  the  mashed  potato  substance,  shaping  into  a  small  patty.  Then  roll  each  one  in  crisp  bread  crumbs.  Fry  in  butter,  turning  frequently,  until  a  nice  golden  brown.  Serve  with  hot  apple  sauce,  or  cold  if  you  prefer.  This  quantity  is  sufficient  for  four.  Excellent  as  a  Sunday  night  sup-  per dish.   The  latest  dessert  of  the  film  players  is  "Crepe  Suzettes."  They  are  served  in  the  afternoon  in  place  of  delicate  tea  tidbits,  at  night  as  a  final  snack  before  retiring.  And  have  even  taken  the  place  of  toast  and  marmalade  on  the  breakfast  menu.  This  dish  was  introduced  in  Holly-  wood by  Miss  Engels  who  uses  the  same  ingredients  and  method  of  preparation  as  Oscar,  famous  chef  of  the  Waldorf  in  New  York.   Crepe  Suzettes    Beat  together  for  five  minutes,  until  thoroughly  thickened,  4  ounces  flour,  ^  ounce  powdered  sugar,  2  whole  eggs,  pinch  of  salt,   %  pint  milk,  2  drops  vanilla  essence,  4  drops  orange  flavoring.  Now  pass  through  colander  into  another  vessel  and  let  stand  for  thirty  minutes.   Slightly  grease  bottom  of  a  small  frying  pan  with  melted  butter  and  put  into  the  pan  two  tablespoonsful  of  the  batter  for  each  pancake.  Spread  over  the  pan  and  do  not  turn  until  well  browned.  Cover  hot  plate  with  powdered  sugar  to  pre-  vent sticking,  then  turn  cake  onto  it.  Proceed  to  make  number  of  pancakes  required  exactly  the  same  way.  Keep  cakes  warm  in  oven  until  all  are  done.    Here  we  see  Wera  Engels  enjoying  a  portion  of  "Pigs  in  Blanket,"    one  of  her  favorite  dishes    The  sauce  which  is  served  with  the  pancakes  is  made  by  mixing  well  the  following  ingredients:  6  ounces  butter;  \^  pint  orange  juice;  6  pieces  lump  sugar  wrapped  in  orange  peel,  to  ex-  tricate the  oil  flavor;  1  ounce  brandy;  1  ounce  curacoa,  and  1  ounce  kirsch.  Now  let  the  whole  thing  come  to  a  slight  boil,  form-  ing a  foam  on  the  surface  which  indicates  the  perfection  of  the  sauce.

Before  serving,  squeeze  a  little  lemon  juice  over  the  pancakes.  Your  friends  will  all  be  clamor-  ing for  the  recipe  of  this  truly  Continental  delicacy.   Miss  Engels'  long  list  of  delec-  table foreign  dainties  also  in-  cludes something  quite  well  known  to  us  Americans — though  she  prepares  it  a  bit  differently.   Seven  Layer  Cake  (Dobos  Torte)   7  eggs,  separated  1  cup  powdered  sugar  1  cup  flour,  well  sifted  Beat  yolks  of  eggs  very  well  with  sugar,  add  flour  and  fold  in  egg    whites,    beaten    very    stiff.  Spread  seven  layers  evenly  on  well  buttered  and  floured  shal-  low jelly  tins.    Bake  in  a  moder-  ately hot  oven,  375  degrees  F.,  for  eight  minutes.  Remove  care-  fully from  pans  with  spatula.  For  filling:  3  eggs   V/l  cups  sugar  3-3  lb.  sweet  chocolate  3  tbs.  cold  water  Y2  lb.  butter  1  ts.  vanilla  Melt  chocolate  with  water  in  double   boiler.      Mix    eggs   and  sugar,   add   to   chocolate,   cook  until  thick,  stirring  constantly.  Remove  from  stove,  add  butter,  stir   until    melted.      Then    add  vanilla.    Beat  until  cool  and  just  stiff    enough    to    spread    easily.  Spread  between  layers,  over  top  and  sides.     To  keep  layers  in  place,  put  several  toothpicks  through  top  layers,  until  filling  sets  firmly.     Serve  after  twenty-  four  hours.   The  cake  may  be  served  this  way  or  you  may  prefer  it  with  a  chocolate  icing.  Here  is  one  that  is  made  quickly  and  with  very  little  trouble.   To  eleven  ounces  of  cold  condensed  milk,  add  three  squares   of  unsweetened  chocolate,  cut  in  pieces.  Place  over  low  flame  and  cook  until  thickened.  Stir  constantly.  Thin  by  adding  water,  a  few  drops  at  a  time,  until  the  icing  is  of  right  con-  sistency to  spread.

With  maddening  slowness  time  drags  on!  .  .  .  And  woman  waits!  .  .  .  Waits  and  worries  over  her  upset  health.   Seldom  does  she  know  that  FEAR  itself  ...  FEAR  of  an  imaginary  crisis  is  the  very  thing  that  throws  her  delicate  femi-  nine mechanism  out  of  gear  .  .  .  Seldom  does  she  realize  that  this  health-stealing  FEAR  is  the  direct  outcome  of  either  timid  ignorance  or  gross  neglect  of  proper  marriage  hygiene.   She  has  failed  to  follow  that  correct  method  of  feminine  antisepsis  as  en-  dorsed for  over  40  years  by  leading  doc-  tors, clinics,  hospitals  and  gynecologists.    They  have  freely  recommended  the  reg-  ular and  continual  use  of  "Lysol"  for  feminine  health,  daintiness,  and  mental  poise.   The  "Lysol"  method  is  so  simple  and  easy  to  follow  . .  .  The  result  so  refreshing  and  agreeable  ...  so  safe  and  effective.   In  sharp  contrast  to  certain  chlorine-  type  antiseptics,  "Lysol"  contains  no  free  caustic  alkali  to  inflame,  sear  and  toughen  tender  tissues  .  .  .  And  unlike  these  chlorine  compounds,  which  lose  95%  of  their  effectiveness  in  the  presence  of  organic  matter,  "Lysol"  retains  its  power  to  destroy  germ-life.    Don't  be  caught  again  in  the  grip  of  "CALENDAR  FEAR"  ...  Practice  in-  timate feminine  cleanliness.  Use  "Lysol."  Your  druggist  has  it.  Your  doctor  rec-  ommends it  .  .  .  One  thing  more,  write  for  a  copy  of  the  new,  free  "Lysol"  booklet,  "Marriage  Hygiene — the  im-  portant part  it  plays  in  the  ideal  mar-  riage."

Don't  miss  it.     {March)    ROBBERS'  ROOST— Fox  —  A  grand  Western!  George  O'Brien  and  Maureen  O' Sullivan  in  top  form.     (Feb.)    ROME  EXPRESS— Gaumont  British-Universal.  — An  excellently  done  train  ride,  with  a  leisurely  melodrama  thrown  in.  Fine  cast;  Conrad  Veidt  as  the  villain.  (April)    SAILOR  BE  GOOD— RKO- Radio. — Barrelhouse  humor  features  this  appearance  of  Jack  Oakie,  as  a  bibulous  gob.     (March)    SLIGHTLY  MARRIED—  Invincible.  —  Slightly  entertaining,  with  Walter  Byron  and  Evalyn  Knapp.  (Feb.)    SOMEWHERE  IN  SONORA— Warners— Love-  ly scenery  would  make  this  a  good  travelogue.  As  a  Western — ho-hum.  (.1  pril)    •  SON-DAUGHTER,  THE— M-G-M.—  Helen  Hayes,  though  loving  Ramon  Novarro  (a  prince  in  disguise)  marries  a  repulsive  fellow  (Warner  Oland)  so  her  father  (Lewis  Stone)  can  have  am-  munition money;  later  strangles  her  husband  with  his  own  queue.     (Feb.)    SO  THIS  IS  AFRICA— Columbia.— Wheeler  and  Woolsey  slip  the  loud  and  raucous  razzberry  to  the  animal  pictures.      (March)    •  TOPAZE  —  RKO-Radio.  —  John  Barrymore  hides  his  profile  in  the  whiskers  of  a  French  schoolmaster,  then  outslicks  life  and  the  slickers.  Superb.  (April)    UNDER-COVER  MAN  —  Paramount.  —  You'll  forget  any  objections  to  George  Raft  while  a  gangster,  after  you  see  him  tear  into  the  hot-bond  racket.  Nancy  Carroll  also  good.      Not  for  children.     (Feb.)   UNDER  THE  TONTO  RIM— Paramount.— A  fine,  breezy  Western  with  Stu  Erwin.      (May)    UNWRITTEN  LAW,  THE— Majestic  Pictures.  — The  wronged  man  (Purnell  Pratt)  leaves  it  to  his  companions  whether  he  shall  slay  the  villain  (Lew  Cody).

(March)    SECRET    OF    MADAME    BLANCHE,    THE—   M-G-M. — Too  bad  the  Madame  X  theme  can't  be  given  a  well-earned  rest.  Jean  Parker  rather  grabs  the  show  from  Irene  Dunne.     (March)    •  SECRETS— United  Artists.— Poor  little  rich  girl  Mary  Pickford  flees  her  New  England  home  for  pioneer  life  in  the  West  with  Leslie  Howard.  Well  worth  seeing.

(April)    SELF-DEFENSE  —  Monogram.  —  Pauline  Frederick  has  her  troubles  running  a  Canadian  saloon  and  gambling  hall  on  the  level.  Interesting,  thanks  to  Pauline.     (Feb.)    •  SHE  DONE  HIM  WRONG— Paramount  —  First-class  rough  stuff  about  the  gay  Nineties  on  the  Bowery,  with  Mae  West,  Cary  Grant,  Noah  Beery  and  others.     Not  for  tender  minds.     (March)    •  SIGN  OF  THE  CROSS,  THE— Paramount.  — Charles  Laughton's  subtly  satirical  Nero,  admirably  supported  by  Claudette  Colbert  and  Fredric  March,  make  t'.iis  De  Millean  spectacle  of  ancient  Rome  noteworthy.  But  don't  take  the  children.     (Feb.)    SISTER  TO  JUDAS— Mayfair  Pictures.— End-  less slow  reels  about  a  girl  who  tries  to  rise  bv  being  "lit'ry."  (April)    SOUS  LA  LUNE  DU  MAROC  (MOON  OVER   MOROCCO)— Vandal-Delac  Prod.— Five  Euro-  peans under  a  grim  Oriental  spell.  Slow,  but  great  atmosphere.  (April)    SPEED  DEMON — Columbia. — Nothing  unusual,  but  youngsters  will  like  the  speed-boat  races.     (Feb.)    •  STATE  FAIR— Fox.— A  homely  tale  of  Will  Rogers,  Ma  (Louise  Dresser),  their  children  (Janet  Gaynor  and  Norman  Foster),  their  lovers  (Lew  Ayres  and  Sally  Eilers)  and  a  prize  hog.  De-  lightful  entertainment   for   everyone.

(May)    •  SWEEPINGS— RKO-Radio.— A  memorable  portrayal  by  Lionel  Barrymore  of  starting  life  with  a  pushcart  and  becoming  a  merchant  prince —  only  to  have  no-good  children  spoil  all.     (May)    TERROR  TRAIL— Universal.— Tom  Mix  foils  a  hypocritical  leading  citizen,  some  horse  thieves,  and  rescues  Naomi  Judge  in  proper  Mixonian  style.  (March)    THAT'S  MY  BOY— Columbia.— Richard  Crom-  well, with  Dorothy  Jordan,  put  zip  into  this  football  yarn.     (Feb.)

(May)    THEY     JUST    HAD    TO     GET    MARRIED—   Universal. — Slim  Summerville  (a  butler)  and  ZaSu  Pitts  (a  maid)  can't  decide  to  be  divorced.  Weak  story.     (Feb.)    •  TONIGHT  IS  OURS— Paramount.— A  deftly  done  bit  of  Graustarkian  adventure  and  ro-  mance, with  Claudette  Colbert  and  Fredric  March.  (March)    VAMPIRE  BAT,  THE— Majestic  Pictures.—  "Dracula"  horror  stuff  that  creaks  in  the  telling,  although  Lionel  Atwill,  Fay  Wray  and  Melvyn  Douglas  lend  considerable  interest.     (March)    VIRGINS  OF  BALI,  THE— Principal.— Another  "Goona  Goona"  glimpse  of  courtship  and  marriage  in  the  East  Indies.     (Feb.)   WEST  OF  SINGAPORE— Monogram.— An  in-  credibly dull  story  of  oil  in  Malaysia.  (April)   WHAT!  NO  BEER?— M-G-M—  And  not  as  much  fun,  either,  as  Jimmy  Durante  and  Buster  Keaton  should  yield  as  brewers.

(May)   •  WHISTLING  IN  THE  DARK— M-G-M.—  Ernest  Truex  and  Una  Merkel  are  a  riot  in  a  tale  about  a  crime  writer  made  to  invent  a  perfect  crime  for   use  by   his  captors.

YOUNG  BLOOD— Monogram.— A  thin  Robin-  Hoodish  Western  with  Bob  Steele  and  Helen  Foster.  (Feb.)

In  this  picture  it's  the  women  who  do  the  chasing— the  men  who  are  chaste!    She  could  lick  an  army!  Swear  like  a  trooper!  Drink  any  man  down!  What  a  man-eater  she  was!  Until  a  real  man  came  along  and  gave  her  new  ideas  on  life.  From  then  on  things  were  certainly  changed!  .  .  .  This  is  the  "different"  picture  you've  been  longing  for.  So  gay  and  merry  you'll  laugh  yourself  sick  when  you  see  it— and  laugh  a  lot  more  every  time  you  think  about  it.

O  Matron!   is  there  any  reason  to  pay  more  than  o^  for  Tooth  Paste?    1^1  ow  we  offer  you  at  a  saving,  a  quicker,  pleasanter  means  of  keeping  mouth  and  gums  healthy  and  of  beauti-  fying  teeth.  A  dentifrice  that  cleanses  more  thoroughly,  gives  enamel  greater  luster,  and  sweetens  the  breath.  Lis-  terine  Tooth  Paste  is  its  name.  Twenty-  five  cents  is  its  price.   The  promises  made  for  this  tooth  paste  sound  exaggerated,  do  they  not,  when  you  consider  the  many  splendid  dentifrices  in  the  field?  But  there  is  no  exaggeration.   More  than  two  million  women  know  them  to  be  true.  Why  otherwise  would    they  have  rejected  older  and  costlier  favorites  for  Listerine  Tooth  Paste?  The  beauty -giving  results  of  this  prod-  uct are  so  apparent  they  couldn't  be  overlooked  or  denied.  They  have  dem-  onstrated to  millions  the  folly  of  pay-  ing more  than  25^  for  a  tooth  paste.   If  you  haven't  tried  Listerine  Tooth  Paste,  we  urge  you  to  do  so  now.  Note  how  swiftly  and  how  thoroughly  it  cleans  teeth — permeates  every  crevice.   See  how  quickly  it  erases  unsightly  tartar,  stains,  and  discolorations —  particularly  those  due  to  smoking.  Observe    the    flashing   brilliance    and    luster  it  gives  to  your  teeth — modern  polishing  ingredients  so  gentle  in  ac-  tion are  responsible.   Look  also  for  that  wonderful  feeling  of  mouth  freshness  and  exhilaration  that  this  tooth  paste  gives;  the  sensa-  tion you  associate  with  the  use  of  Listerine  itself.   Lastly,  reflect  that  these  benefits  cost  you  about  half  of  what  you  ordi-  narily pay.  The  saving  of  $3.00  a  year  is  a  worthwjiile  one  in  these  thrifty  times.

And  sho'  nuff,  it's  again  true,  as  you'll  agree  when  you  see  Miriam  Hopkins  opposite  Jack  La  Rue  in  Paramount's  picture,  "The  Story  of  Temple  Drake."

Anita  goes  in  for  reading  heavy,  classic  literature  when  she's  not  working  at  the  studio,  for  she  believes  that  one  must  have  a  thoroughly  trained  mind  in  order  to  become  a  really  fine  actress    Irving  Lippman    "V^OU'D  never  believe  this  pretty  charmer  could  roll  her  tongue  'round  ■1  those  guttural  Chinese  words.

Flagler  Hospital  has  a   new  bus.    This  crate  is  four  years  old."    O    DRIVER:  "Don't  you  worry  about  Flagler's.    They  use  cheap  oil.   Even  if  their  bus  is  new,  their  engine's  choked  with  carbon.    We  use  Mobiloil."    A    NURSE  :  "There's  the  Flagler  out-  fit behind  us  now!    Tramp  on  her,  John.

Even  if  our  bus  is  four  years  old,  I'll  say  John  has  certainly  kept  her  engine  in  good  shape."    fi   DOC:  "Well,  we're  there  with  the  speed!     But   John   had   better   keep  that  Mobiloil  a  secret  from  Flagler's — or  they  might  get  to  beating  us."    With  Double-Range  Mobiloil  your  engine  is  safe  at  all  speeds    Your  car  may  not  carry  a  shrieking  ambulance  siren.    But —   Today — with  high  speeds  more  and  more  common — you  can't  be  too  careful  in  choosing  your  oil.  Along  the  highways  today  you  will  find  many  "depression"  oils.  Made  for  a  price,  they  were  never  made  to  take  the  punishment  your  en-  gine gives  them  in  fast  driving.   With  Mobiloil  you  can  give  your  oil  any  kind  of  punishment.    Mobiloil  will    always  stand  up — no  matter  how  hard,  how  far,  or  how  fast  you  drive.  Because  Mobiloil  is  a  unique  double-range  oil,  it  will  not  foul  or  "gum  up"  your  engine  at  slow  speeds.  And  at  high  speeds  —  unlike  ordinary  oils — it  does  not  thin  out  dangerously.  Its  lubricating  rich-  ness protects  your  engine  always.   Save  on  gas — on  oil — on  repairs — and  above  all,  save  on  car  life.  Drive  in  to-  day where  you  see  the  Mobiloil  sign  and    ask  for  Mobiloil.  Remember — double-  range  Mobiloil  offers  you  the  best  engine  protection  at  all  speeds  — fast  or  slow.

Close-Ups  and  Long-Shots    HOLLYWOOD  has  touched  bottom  and  is  now  standing  firmly  on  bedrock.  Like  dwellers  on  slightly  elevated  lands,  it  had  watched  the  great  wave  of  national  depression  sweep  over  the  valleys,  without  being  itself,  apparently,  affected.   But  finally  the  mountain  tidal  wave  inundated  also  that  position  of  security.  Hollywood  emerged  from  the  maelstrom  bewildered  and  out  of  breath,  but  still  very  much  alive.  The  worst  of  the  storm  seems  to  be  over.   THE  harmony  and  unity  shown  by  almost  the  entire  personnel  of  the  industry  revealed  an  ad-  mirable spirit.  Hollywood's  fortitude  in  the  face  of  the  bank  holiday,  the  cut  in  salaries  and  the  earth-  quake has  given  the  world  something  new  to  think  about.   People  who  have  been  asking,  "Can  Hollywood  'Take  It'?"  will  find,  on  page  thirty-nine  of  this  issue  of  Photoplay,  a  straight-from-the-shoulder  answer  to  that  question.   HARD  on  Hollywood's  calamities  appeared  George  Bernard  Shaw,  famous  playwright,  dis-  pensing wit  that  stunned  but  cheered.  That  is,  cheered  all  but  the  immediate  victims  of  his  vitriol.  If  Hollywood  had  failed  the  gentle  tradition  of  the  ages — that  one  must  be  polite  to  guests — George  would  not  have  gotten  away  with  it,  for  Hollywood  has  its  own  unmatched  "ribbers."  Vince  Barnett  has  been,  perhaps,  champion  of  this  sort  of  thing.   But  everyone  didn't  take  it  lying  down.  For  example,  stage  actress  Alice  Brady,  now  making  a  picture  in  Hollywood,  is  credited  with  telling  him  that  his  jokes  were  as  old  as  his  whiskers.   Hollywood  breathed  a  sigh  of  relief  when  their  un-  conventional guest  departed,  for  when  Shaw's  around,  you  can  no  more  disregard  him  than  you  can  an  epidemic  of  small-pox.   REPORTS  come  in  that  movie  attendance  is  de-  creasing among  adult  males;  that  there  has  been  some  falling  off  in  feminine  attendance;  that  there  are  new  addicts  among  adolescents  between  the  ages  of  fourteen  and  sixteen.   Men  are  credited  with  being  a  bit  weary  of  sex  on  the  screen,  or  with  not  knowing  what  new  trends  in    motion  pictures  are  all  about.     A  hardly  plausible  theory,  that.   The  front  rows  in  girlie  shows  in  New  York  City  are  still  filled  with  bald-headed  men.  And  Mae  West  is  bowling  them  over,  not  only  throughout  our  broad  land,  but  in  good  old  Lunnon,  too.  It  is  easy  to  establish  a  seemingly  profound  theory,  but  it  is  much  harder  to  prove  that  theory.   MAE  WEST'S  pictures  are  big  box-office.  So  is  "Cavalcade."  So  was  "Smilin'  Through."  "State  Fair" — with  Will  Rogers  and  Janet  Gaynor —  looks  like  another  winner.  "King  Kong"  has  made  everyone's  eyes  pop.   There  you  have  it — sex  and  sweet  romance;  love,  war  and  unhappiness;  sentiment  of  the  Middle  West;  and  a  monstrous,  incredible  nightmare.  The  public  has  responded  to  all.   Only  a  brash  or  irresponsible  prophet  would  dare  forecast  what  the  public  really  wants.   NEVERTHELESS,  it  would  be  hard  for  producers  not  to  succumb  to  a  certain  pattern  that  has  achieved  big  box-office.  "Grand  Hotel,"  with  its  galaxy  of  stars,  was  probably  the  motivating  force  for  such  films  as  "Luxury  Liner,"  and  "Rome  Express."  Probably  the  producers  of  these  pictures  did  not  expect  to  emulate  the  success  of  their  prototype.  Nor  were  their  moderate  hopes  disappointed.   DIXXER  at  Eight,"  a  success  on  the  Xew  York  stage,  bears  in  its  construction  and  in  certain  psychological  elements  a  resemblance  to  "Grand  Hotel."  Xew  York  City  has  applauded  it.  M-G-M  is  now  screening  it  with  an  impressive  cast,  beyond  the  dreams  of  any  stage  producer.   Among  the  big  names  are  Marie  Dressier,  Lionel  Barrymore,  John  Barrymore,  Jean  Harlow,  Lee  Tracy,  Karen  Morley,  Jean  Hersholt,  Madge  Evans,  Edmund  Lowe,  and  such  stage  favorites  as  May  Robson  and  Billie  Burke.   Even  though  "Dinner  at  Eight"  was  a  stage  suc-  cess, we  cannot  be  sure  what  sort  of  picture  it  will  be  when  it  comes  out  of  the  cutting  room.  But  with  that  cast  it  ought  to  be  sure  fire.   There  are  half  a  dozen  names  there  that  would  carry  any  picture.   21    Here  it's  a  ease  of  the  actors  and  not  the  play  that's  the  thing.     So  it's  pretty  safe  to  prophesy.   AND  while  I  am  on  the  subject  of  plays,  I  suggest  that  every  producer  of  revues  see  "42nd  Street."  There  is  much  more  to  it  than  girls  and  music.  And  the  presentation  is  done  with  a  sparkle  and  dash  from  which  the  stage  might  get  new  inspiration.   Everyone  knows  by  now  how  little  Ruby  Keeler  stole  the  show  with  her  nimble  toes.  You  may  look  for  many  a  day — and  in  vain — to  find  anything  like  her  performance   elsewhere.   And  this  advice  is  not  only  for  stage  producers.  It  is  for  the  motion  picture  public,  as  well.    FOR  once,  Groucho  Marx  had  nothing  to  say.  Groueho  has  been  in  the  habit  of  rising  in  the  Brown  Derby  and,  for  no  reason  at  all,  making  a  speech  to  the  amazed  customers.   But  one  night  they  were  ready  for  him.  Groucho  arose  and  very  solemnly  began.  "Ladies  and  gentle-  men— "  when  immediately  everyone  screamed,  "We  want  Cantor.     We  want  Cantor."   Abashed  and  overcome,  Groucho  sat  down  and  finished  his  dinner  in  quiet.   How  would  Shaw  have  responded  to  that?    ONE  picture  recently  released  is  going  to  make  considerable  stir,  or  I  am  badly  mistaken.  It  is  titled,  "Gabriel  Over  the  White  House."   One  critic  who  wished  to  damn  it,  unconsciously  praised  it,  instead.  Said  he,  "The  world  of  'Gabriel'  is  the  infantile  world  of  irresistible  wishes."  He  has  put  his  finger  right  on  it.  That  is  what  the  whole  world  is  praying  for.   "Gabriel  Over  the  White  House"  is  reviewed  in  this  issue  of  Photoplay.  Regarding  its  story,  I  will  say  here  only  that  it  shows  what  would  happen  if  a  presi-  dent seized  dictatorial  power  and  went  to  the  mat  with  old  man  Depression.   "Irresistible  wishes!"  That,  in  my  belief,  is  the  fundamental  pull  of  Mickey  Mouse.  Mickey  con-  stantly does  the  physically  impossible,  and  we  love  it.   It  compensates  for  all  our  thwarted  efforts.  Doug-  las Fairbanks,  Sr.,  at  his  best,  held  us  entranced  for  the   same   reason.    "  /"" "^  ABRIEL"  though  in  fantasy,  solves  our  nation's  VjTeconomic  and  political  problems.  We  get  the  same  kick  out  of  that  as  boys  dreaming  of  how  they  will  go  back  and  give  their  schoolteacher  a  good  licking,  or  even  as  an  adult  may  dream  of  returning  to  his  home  town  a  magnificent  success  to  be  gazed  upon  in  wonder  by  his  old  associates.   "Gabriel  Over  the  White  House"  gives  us  a  new  inspiration.  And  in  so  doing  becomes  a  splendid  picture.    A  CASTING  director  sent  out  a  call  for  men  to  play  aviators  of  the  Royal  Flying  Corps.   Five  men  responded  at  once.   "Why,  these  men  won't  do,"  the  casting  director  said,  looking  at  the  graying  heads.   "But,"  said  one  of  them,  "we  were  members  of  the  Royal  Flying  Corps."   "Yes,"  the  casting  director  replied,  "but,  you  see,  we  want  men  who  are  like  you  were  fifteen  years  ago.  Young  fellows  like  they  had  in  the  war."   Sadly  and  quietly  the  brave  men  who  had  faced  death  filed  out.   INSTEAD  of  the  half  pay  for  eight  weeks  system  inaugurated  by  the  other  studios,  Fox  employees  agreed  to  work  four  weeks  with  no  pay  rather  than  have  the  studio  shut  down  indefinitely.  And  as  a  gesture  of  appreciation,  the  studio  gave  everyone  his  luncheon  at  the  studio  commissary  free.   And  suddenly  everyone  went  off  that  diet.  With  pie  and  ice  cream  for  dessert.   Over  at  the  RKO-Radio  studio,  lunch  prices  were  slashed  in  half.  As  a  result  figures  are  being  ruined  both  in  Hollywood.   Page  Sylvia,  someone!   TALK  has  been  bandied  about  during  the  past  month  that  Hollywood,  as  a  picture  producing  institution,  might  come  trekking  East.   The  theory  seemed  to  be  that  cloudy  Long  Island  was  just  as  good  a  locale  for  production  as  sunny  Southern  California,  as  kliegs  do  most  of  the  lighting,  anyway.   However,  there  is  something  like  one  hundred  million  dollars  invested  in  land,  buildings  and  equip-  ment in  the  Coast  studios.  Nor  can  the  recent  earth-  quake have  much  effect  one  way  or  another  on  any  such  decision.   First  of  all,  Hollywood  was  little  damaged  by  the  shocks.  Then  they  come  too  infrequently  to  instigate  a  general  exodus.  San  Francisco  is  nearly  a  century  old.   And  its  one  great  upheaval  of  nearly  thirty  years  ago  is  unknown  —  by  actual  experience  —  to  the  present  generation.   No,  it  looks  as  though  Hollywood  will  keep  its  motion  picture  trade-mark.   ENGLISH  movies!     Is  this  the  reason  they  fall,  in  interest,  behind  the  Hollywood  product?  Esther  Ralston,  doing  a  picture  for  the  Gaumont  Studios  in  London,  had  a  call  the  first  day  for  nine  o'clock.   She  arrived  at  seven-thirty  to  make  up,  just  as  she  would  have  done  in  Hollywood,  but  no  one,  not  even  the  gat eman,  was  down  to  work.  Esther  waited  for  more  than  an  hour.   Good  pictures  aren't   made  that   way.   Kathryn  Dougherty    Harvey  White    JOHNNY  WEISSMULLER  rose  to  fame  on  the  strength  of  his  J  handsome  physique,  and  lovely  ladies,  the  world  over,  have  gambled  with  each  other  ever  since  for  a  permanent  mortgage  on  the  brawny,  tawny  Tarzan.  First,  'twas  Bobbe  Arnst,  who  held  claim,  then  Lupe  Velez,  and  now  who  shall  it  be?    29    The  Unbeautiful    Meet    "two-faced"    Clara    Bow!  Two-faced,  that  is,  in  appearance    SO  you  think  they're  beautiful,  do  you — Joan  Crawford  and  Garbo,  Gaynor,  Dietrich,  Bow,  Kay  Francis,  Connie  Bennett,  and  the  others?   You  thrill  at  their  glamour  on  the  screen,  and  you  read  their  secrets  of  loveliness — and  like  the  rest  of  us,  you  too  have  gone  along  placidly  believing  that  they    truly  are  beauties.   But — here  comes,  now,  a  world-famed  expert  on  feminine  beauty,  a  man  whose  profession  beauty  is,  a  man  who  has  made  a  career-long  study  of  beauty.  And  in  the  heart  of  Hollywood,  he  has  the  effrontery  and  the  courage  to  survey  the  ranking  charmers  of  filmdom  and  flatly  tell  them  and  the  world —   "No!     They  are  not  beautiful!"   And  if  you  don't  believe  him,  this  man  is  ready  to  prove  what  he  says,  in  black  and  white,  with  lines  and  demonstra-  tion.   He'll  do  it  right  here.   His  name  is  Pogany — Willy  Pogany.  You've  heard  it.  His  paintings  of  beautiful  women  and  other  subjects  have  been  hung  in  famous  art  galleries   throughout  the  world.  He  has  memberships  in  Beaux  Arts  Institutes  and  Art  Leagues;  he  has  a  collection  of  medals  from  all  manner  of  exhibits,  from  World  Fairs  to  Art  Society  shows,  everywhere.   At  present,  he's  in  Hollywood,  art  director  for  various  producers.  All  this  is  told  not  to  bore  you,  but  to  assure  you  that  instead  of  a  know-nothing  and  a  nonentity  speaking,  these  criticisms  of  Hollywood's  beauties'  beauty  come  from  a  man  who  is  conceded  to  know.   Also,  for  your  particular  interest,  Pogany  points  out  that  in  many  of  his  criticisms  will  be  found  easy-to-heed  hints  that  every  woman  can  use,  as  do  these  "unbeautiful  beauties,"  to  outwit  nature.    Now  let's  go — let's  see  Pogany  tear  our  beauties  to  pieces.  The  "Unbeautiful  Thirteen"  are  these  (printed  as  Pogany  marked  them) :   Clara  Bow,  Ruth  Chatterton,  Janet  Gaynor,  Con-  stance Bennett,  Billie  Dove,  Kay  Francis,  Ann  Hard-  ing, Katharine  Hepburn,  Marlene  Dietrich,  Sylvia  Sidney,  Norma  Shearer,  Joan  Crawford,  Greta  Garbo.   Let's  take  them,  one  by  one.   Clara  Bow   "She's  not  beautiful,  but  she's  sexy!  If  ever  a  face  and  figure  cried  'Sex!'  Clara's  do.  As  for  her  face,  taking  it  apart,  we  find  not  one  face,  but  two  halves  of  totally  dissimilar  faces.   "Look  at  the  picture.  At  the  line  marked  'A,'  Clara's  face  is  divided.  Above  that  line,  her  face-type  is  pure  concave;  below  the  line,  it's  the  complete  op-  posite— convex.  Notice  the  opposing  curves  on  the  lines  I've  drawn  to  indicate  the  difference.  To  be  technically  perfect,  her  face  would  have  to  be  entirely  of  one  type  or  the  other.  But  then,  it  wouldn't  be  Clara  Bow,  and  the  face  might  be  behind  a  department  store  counter  selling  ribbons  instead  of  making  thousands  a  week  in  Hollywood!   "If  it  weren't  for  that  ir-  regularity, Clara  would  have  just  another  doll-face.  In-  cidentally, the  most  striking  asset  of  Clara's  appearance  does  not  show  on  the  screen.  It's  her  vivid  coloring.  It's  a  great  pity  she  can't  be  photo-  graphed in  natural  colors!"   Ruth  Chatterton   "Not  beautiful — but  beauti-  fully serene.  Want  to  see  some  tricks?  Then  look  at  the  way  I've  marked  the  mouth  on  this  picture.  The  distance  'B'  is  the  apparent  size  of  her    The  artist  says  that  art  gives  Ruth  Chatterton  her  well-shaped  mouth    Who  would  have  thought  Ann  Harding  lacked  classic  beauty?  That's  what  the  artist  finds,though,asyousee    SO    Thirteen    Every  one  is  a  first-rank  star.  Yet  Willy  Pogany,  noted  artist,  claims  they  lack  true  beauty    By  Carl  Vonnell    mouth.  The  truth  is  that  Distance  'A'  is  the  real  Chat-  terton  mouth-line.  By  lip  make-up  she  has  brought  it  down,  achieved  a  spirituelle  effect  that  the  larger  mouth  would  lose.  Chatterton's  eyes  are  her  best  fea-  ture, by  far.  They  are  really  lovely — and  they  are  spaced  according  to  truly  beautiful  standards — one  eye-width  apart.  That  is,  Distance  'C  is  exactly  the  width  of  each  of  her  eyes."   Ann  Harding   "She  is   not    quite    beautiful,   although  she   more  nearly  approaches  academic  beauty  than  most  of  the  stars.    Call  her  goddess-like.    Her  features  are  almost  classic.     It's  her  good  luck  that  they  are  not  perfect.  One  imperfection — her  eyes  are  quite  different  in  size.  The  left  is  smaller  than  the  right.     Notice  how  the  lines    I've    drawn   across   their  upper   and   lower   limits  should  converge,  if  extended,  instead  of  being  parallel  as  they  should  be,  in  perfection?   "This  and  other  distortions  achieve  attractiveness  whereas  their  lack  would  leave  simply  a  cold,  though  perfectly  beautiful,  face.  You  might  admire  it,  but  you  wouldn't  want  to  love  it."   Janet  Gaynor   "She's  not  beautiful,  but  is  'wistfully  charming.'  That  wist-  fulness,  which  is  purely  an  ex-  pression, is  the  main  key  to  her  attractiveness.  None  of  her  fea-  tures are  bad,  but  none  of  them  are  at  all  above  absolute  average.  On  the  street,  you'd  not  notice  her.  But  she  knows  the  value  of  that  wistfulness,  and  manages  to  keep  it  on  her  face."    Is  Katharine  Hepburn  elfin?    The  artist  shows  why  he  says  "Yes!"    Norma  Shearer    So  Norma  Shearer  is  a  woman  with  two  personalities  —  each  owning  one-half  of  her  face!   You  see  it?    "She's  not  beautiful,  but  she  is  cer-  tainly very  feminine!  Something  as  in  the  case  of  Clara  Bow,  Norma's  face  can  be  divided  into  two  distinct  types.  Flick  a  line  across  the  face,  horizontally,  at  the  nose-line,  as  I  indicate  in  the  picture.  Below  the  line,  her  face  is  one  of  true  beauty.  But  above  that  line,  beauty  gives  way  to  a  definite  allure — a  purely  feminine  character-  istic. Cover  each  half,  in  turn,  and  you'll  get  what  I  mean.  If  you  other  girls  want  a  tip,  notice  how  she  achieves  that  allure  by  the  narrowing  of  her  eyes.  You  can  learn  from  her!"   Katharine  Hepburn    "I'm  glad  she  doesn't  consider  herself   beautiful,   because   she  certainly   isn't.   Call  her  'elfin,'  if  anything.    Oh,  there's   lots  of  character  in  the  face.     Know  what  it  makes  me  think   of?     I'll  show  you.   "Look  at  what  I've  done  to  the  brows.  Now  add  a  Pipe-of-Pan  to  her  lips,  and  you've  got  what  ? — the  face  of  a  Puck,  of  a  Satyr.  That's  exactly  what  Hepburn  represents  to  me.  It's  ex-  traordinary; it's  elfin;  it's  exciting;  it's  challenging — but  it  certainly  is  not  beautiful.  And  I  think  you'll  agree  that  her  work  on  the  screen  uses  that  challenge,  instead  of  beauty,  for  its  appeal.    Is  Janet  Gaynor's  charm  all  in  her  ex-  pression? So  the  cold-hearted  art  critic   reveals    to    us    Billie  Dove   "More  than  any  other  in  this  group  — of  that  I  can  think  of  in  all  Holly-  wood, for  that  matter! — does  Billie  ap-   31    /    Billie  Dove,  in  the  artist's  eye,  comes  nearest  of  all  to  being    a    classical    beauty    Triangles  are  old  in  plots  but  we're  told  Sylvia  Sidney  has  'em  right  in  her  face!    proach  true  beauty.  It's  quite  fair  that  she's  been  called  the  'most  beautiful  woman  on  the  screen,'  for  she  is  that.  But  even  here,  we  fall  short  of  perfection — thank  heaven!  Fortunately,  you  see,  her  face  is  a  little  bit  off  axis;  a  bit  crooked,  in  plain  words.   "The  left  eye  is  a  bit  high,  the  nose  slants  ever  so  little.   "And  what  does  this  do?  It  de-  stroys one  hundred  per  cent  perfec-  tion, but  it  leaves  a  human  being  who  is  so  nearly  beautiful  that  she  needn't  worry  over  thebit  that  isn't."   Greta  Garbo   "Beautiful?  No!  Her  face  is  utterly  'sad'  —  and  also,  utterly  asymmetrical!  That  means  it's  en-  tirely crooked,  utterly  askew.   "I  mean  merely  that  the  lines  are  cock-eyed.  I've  marked  them,  so  you  cansee.  Forinstance, truesymmetry  would  require  that  her  face  be  half-  and-half  divided  on  each  side  of  Line  No.  1.  But  is  it?  No,  the  lower  half  goes  off  at  a  violent  angle,  as  per  Line  2.   "And  her  eyes  are  all  askew,  too.  Besides  the  right  one  being  smaller,  it's  quite  a  bit  lower  than  the  left.   "See  how  crookedly  the  eye-lines  cross  the  central  line?  Why,  there  is  not  one  feature  of  her  face  which  isn't  crooked  in  comparison  with  the  others!  And  yet,  there  is  in  all  this  asymmetry  a  sadness  and  a  tragedy  which  is  'beautiful'  in  the  same  way  that  a  great  tragedy  of  the  stage  is  'beautiful.'  Yes,  call  her  'beauti-  ful' even  though  she's  by  no  means  a  'beauty'!"    Sylvia  Sidney   "She's  a  faceful  of  triangles!  If  you  want  to  name  her  face,  call  it  'Oriental.'  It  has  the  strange  lure  of  the  Orient  in  its  lines — the  slant-  ing eyes,   the  greater  width   than   ■  12    Well,  well!    See  how  many  lines  it  takes  to  show  defects  Garbo  is  said  to  have!    Kay   Francis,    the    artist   finds,    has   the  "Garbo  defect,"  but  in  reverse  direction    Marlene   also   shows  a    variation  of  the  "Garbo  defect."     Can  you  see  what  it  is?    height,  the  large  mouth  in  the  small  face.  And  look  at  how  the  triangles  run  in  the  facial  lines,  will  you?  Triangles  may  be  in-  teresting  symbolically  or  geometrically,  but  they  can  hardly  be  called 'beautiful.'  And  too,  for  pure  beauty,  the  over-proportion  of  the  face  between  the  lines  in-  dicated by  'A'  as  contrasted  with  the  tiny  space  marked  'B'  is  quite  unacademic.  There's  sen-  suality and  kindness  combined  in  that  face  —  just  as  in  the  Oriental  female. "   Kay  Francis   "Second  in  crookedness  only  to  Garbo's.  See  how  askew  the  face  is  technically.  Only  it  slants,  at  the  bottom,  in  the  other  direction  from  the  Garbo  slant.  And  be-  sides being  off-center,  the  Francis  face,  like  Sylvia  Sidney's,  has  the  upper  part  'A'  much  too  large  in  comparison  with  the  distance  'B'.  Now  I  don't  mean  that  this  is  un-  attractive; I  only  mean  that  it's  entirely  irreconcilable  with  the  artist's  academic  proportions  of  classic  beauty.  If  you  want  true  classic  beauty,  get  yourself  an  ancient  Greek  statue,  my  readers,  but  don't  try  to  fix  things  up  with  any  of  these  Hollywood  girls.  Kay's  is  a  very  intelligent  face.  Call  it  definitely  intriguing,  though  not  at  all  beautiful.  "   Marlene  Dietrich   "Not  beautiful,  but  certainly  interesting.

Both  were  bitter.    With  complete  finality,  they  separated.   Miss  Selwyn  began  divorce  proceedings.   A  short  time  later  Selwyn  was  told  to  start  production  on  "Men  Must  Fight."  His  cast  was  assigned.  One  of  the  prin-  cipals was  his  wife,  Ruth.   There  was  nothing  he  could  do  about  this.  Although  he  and  his  wife  had  pledged  that  they  were  through  forever  and  had  asserted  they  would  never  see  each  other  again,  they  were  thrown  together  in  a  most  intimate  situation.   Production  lasted  for  weeks.  Their  nerves  were  strained  to  breaking  through  a  circumstance  over  which  neither  had  the  slightest  control.  There  was  no  escape.  At  the  end  of  the  picture,  Ruth  went  to  a  hospital  suffering  from  a  nervous  breakdown  and  insomnia.   Her  husband  visited  her.   They  had  a  common  sense  talk.   "  Hollywood's  the  one  place  in  the  world  where,  after  love  is  dead,  you  can't  give  it  a  decent  burial,"  Selwyn  said.  "We're  bound  together  by  ties  we  can't  break.  We  can't  escape  from  a  lot  of  bitter  memories.    So  let's  try  it  again."   Ruth  saw  the  logic  of  his  argument  and  agreed.  She  knew  from  this  one  bitter  experience  that  they  might  "part  forever,"  only  to  find  themselves  working  together  in  another  picture.   In  other  towns  and  cities  throughout  the  world  two  people  may  part  and  not  see  each  other  for  years,  if  ever.  One  or  the  other  is  free  to  go  to  some  other  place   and  start  life  anew,  far  from  the  scene  °f        r>         j-i   7  7   unhappiness.      Motion    picture    people       LtV   Jl/dWQ  I'U    Virginia  Bruce  and  Lupe  Velez  were  at  "outs"  over  one  Jack  Gilbert.  And  they  had  to  meet  while   in   "Kongo"    Ruth  Selwyn  found  herself  working  under  husband  Edgar's  direction  in  "Men  Must  Fight"  —  after  they  had  begun  divorce  proceed-  ings.   Read  what  happened    can't  do  this  because  there  is  just  one  place  in  the  United  States  where  pictures  are  made.  That's  Hollywood.   If  work  doesn't  throw  divorced  couples  and  ex-sweethearts  to-  gether, social  life  will.  On  every  side,  there  are  reminders  of  the  love  that  is  dead  but  won't  stay  buried.   Recently,  Fredric  March  and  his  wife,  Florence  Eldridge,  gave  a  party.  Among  their  friends  there  was  a  prominent  director  who  had  been  divorced  and  remarried.  Quite  by  an  oversight,  the  first  wife  of  this  director  had  been  invited  to  the  same  party.  The  ex-wife  was  the  first  to  arrive.   When  the  present  Mrs.  Director  appeared,  she  glanced  over  the  assembled  guests.  Her  eyes  focused  on  the  woman  who  had  once  been  the  wife  of  her  husband.  She  became  literally  frozen  with  anger.   "Either  that  woman  gets  out  of  here  or  I  do!  I  won't  stay  in  the  same  room  with  her — the  same  house  with  her!"   With  that  pronouncement,  she  lied  from  the  party,  leaving  host,  hostess  and  guests  dumfounded.   THESE  are  the  things  which  happen  when  human  beings  are  chained  and  locked  in  a  small  circle,  with  fate  holding  the  keys.     Fate  asks  this  bitter  question:   "After  love  is  dead,  do  you  want  to  stay  here  and  be  famous,   although  haunted  by  the  most  unhappy  memories — or  do  you   want  to  go  away,  giving  up  home,  career  and  friends? "   Either  answer  damns  the  unfortunate  one.   Adolphe  Menjou  and  Kathrvn  Carver  recently  decided  that   they  would  go  their  separate  ways.    They  never  wanted  to  see   Kathrvn    each  other  again.    Churchill    Immediately  after  the  parting,  began  divorce  proceedings.

And  brother,  did  we  shake?    Did  we  quiver  and  did  we  shimmy?  Hold  'em,  Yale!   Out  of  a  clear  evening  sky,  and  a  calm  tropical  breeze,  Hollywood  heaved  up  in  the  middle  like  a  Lionel  Barrymore  "burp"  and  where  were  we  when  the  lights  went  out?    Brother,  can  you  spare  a  match?   Polly  Moran  sat  beneath  a  permanent  waver.  Her  hair  in  coils  of  electric  wires.  And  then  came  the  deluge.  Pop!  Crackle!  Sizz!  Polly  danced  the  fandango  in  two-step  time,  with  back  kicks  and  splits,  lost  three  new  teeth,  her  step-ins  and  her  sweet  disposition.    The  curlers  sizzed  and  Polly  frizzed.   The  old  earth  shimmied  and  Polly  emerged  five  minutes  later  with  bangs  on  the  wrong  place,  egg  shampoo,  burned  scalp,  plucked  eyebrows,  three  bald  spots,  one  eye  blacked,  one  left  ear  slightly  broiled  and  no  step-ins.  All  for  the  price  of  one  permanent  wave.   Ventura  reports  Polly  passed  there  Saturday  morning.  Still  running  at  sixty  miles  an  hour.   Chevalier  stood  beside  a  pond  on  a  Paramount  sound  stage.  Singing  a  ^ove  song  to  two  bedazzled  swans.  Heave-ho,  and  one  swan  went  head  first  up  Maurice's  trouser  leg,  while  the  other  rammed  a  huge  foot  in  his  French  accent.  While  Maurice  went  whirling  about,  swan's  foot  in  his  mouth,  yelling,  "Gulb,  bulb,  ulb,  vat  ze  'ell."   Kay  Francis  slept.     Peacefully  through  it  all.     Knowing  nothing.   Al  Jolson,  his  wife,  Ruby  Keeler,  and  her  two  sisters,  sat  in  their  twelfth  floor  apartment  in  The  Town  House.   Over  she  swayed  and  Ruby  screamed.    The  sisters  howled.    Al  jellied.   "Let's  pray,  Al,"  Ruby  begged.  "We'll  go  over  with  the  next  swing  sure."  The  sisters  kneeled  at  one  window.    Al  at  the  other.   Suddenly  the  door  burst  open.  In  popped  a  friend,  wild-eyed  at  Al  on  his  knees.  "My  Gawd,"  he  screamed,  "an  earthquake  and  he  still  sings  'Mammy.'  '   Into  the  doorway  of  her  dressing-room  dashed  Claudette  Colbert.  Suddenly  from  the  balcony  above,  a  figure  fell.  A  woman.  With  no  head.    At  Claudette's  feet.    An  earthquake,  and  baby  Ruggles  two  blocks  away!  Mother  Arline  Judge,  hubby  Wesley,  brother  Charles,  cook  and  gardener,  the  dog  and  three  cats,  tore  home,  past  Lil  Tashman's  house    One  scream  and   Claudette  passed  out  cold.  While  someone  rushed  forward  and  picked    up    a    dress-  maker's dummy,  fully  clothed,  that  had  popped  out    of    the    fitting    room  above.  "Earthquake!  Earthquake  Stan  Laurel  shouted  to  a  be-  wildered Oliver  Hardy.     "Let's  run  to  the  doorway!     Get  into  the  doorway!     It's  safer!"     So  Ollie  ran   to   the  doorway   and  completely  filled  it.     After  the  plump    Hardy,    there    was    no  t    1 1  '  room  for  Laurel,  who  stood  in   ^s^  /  the  middle  of  the  room,  amidst   >— ^-^  falling  plaster,  and  wept,   "You  took  my   place,  you  big  lummox.     No  fair.     You  took  all  the  room."  Kay  Francis  slept  on.  Nils  Asther  had  a  cold  and  decided  a  Turkish  bath  was  what  he  needed.     Completely  in  the  nude,  Nils  had  just  lain  down  on  the  table,  when  the  lights  went  out.    There  was  a  jar.    A  shake.    Nils  landed  squarely  on  the  fat  man  on  the  next  table.  The  man  on  the  other  side  landed  on  Nils.      They  rolled  to  the  floor.  All  in  a  mad   confusion.      Suddenly  they  spotted  a  tiny  ray  of  light  under  the  door  and  made  for  it.   A  scream!  A  howl!  A  shriek!  It  was  the  ladies'  room.  One  large  woman,  draped  in  a  towel,  stepped  firmly  on  Nils'  face  trying  to  get  out.  While  another  sat  on  his  tummy  and  wept.  She'd  lost   her  uppers.    Yes,  everyone  was  blue,  but  old  mother  earth  was  green  as  she  heaved  and  shook  with   landsickness    Nils  isn't  over  it  yet.   Ralph  Morgan  drove  up  the  boulevard  to   his    home.      Anxious    about    his    wife    and   daughter.    Thankful  that  he  was  unharmed.   Up  the  driveway  he  tore,  into  the  garage,   and  right  through  the  back  of  it  into  the  neighbor's  clothes  line   in  the  next  yard.     They  picked  him  out  with  a  black  eye,  a   bruised  head,  a  sore  thumb  and  the  neighbor's  chemise  wrapped   around  his  Adam's  apple.   "I  was  so  excited,  I  forgot  to  take  my  foot  off  the  gas,"  he  moaned.   Marion  Davies  was  in  the  midst  of  a  scene  for  "Peg  O'  My  Heart."  She  was  supposed  to  be  ill  in  bed  with  a  doctor  peering  down  her  throat.   Suddenly,  the  shake!  Confusion!  Turmoil!  Screaming!  With  Marion  still  in  bed,  yelling.   After  the  excitement  had  died  down  they  began  the  scene  again.   The  throat  instrument  was  gone!  There  was  a  sudden  silence.  And  then  a  howl  from  Marion.   my  heavens!"  she  screamed,  "I  think  I  swallowed  it  the  earthquake! "  The  X-rays  were  still  searching  when  they  finally  located  it  under  the  bed.   Bob  Montgomery  and  Harry  Beaumont,  his  director,  made  for  the  sound  stage  door.  "You  go  first,"  Bob  urged.  "Oh,  no,  you  first,"  Beaumont  said.   "Y — y — you  go,"  Bob  said,  getting  scareder  and  scareder.  "A — a — a — after  you,"  Beaumont  trembled.  "No,  no,"  Bob  insisted,  laying  his  hands  on  Beaumont.  "You  first,"  Beaumont  said,  seizing  Bob.    And  instantly,  in  their  tense  excitement,  they  began  to  wrestle.     Ten  minutes  later  they  were  found  still  wrestling  on  the  stage  floor.    Neither  had  been  able  to  shove  the  other  out.  Kay  Francis  still  slept  on!   Gary  Cooper,  Franchot  Tone  and  Robert  Young  were  in  a  recording  room  in  pitch  darkness.  With  no  windows  and  only  a  small  opening  in  the  felt  padding  of  the  walls,  for  a  door.   Suddenly  in  the  inky  darkness,  came  the  tremble.  Instantly  the  three  long  legged  men  made  for  under  a  small  low  daven-  port, which  stood  just  a  few  inches  off  the  floor.   When  the  sound  men  came  in  to  find  them,  ten  minutes  later,  there  they  were.  Only  their  heads  under  cover,  their  long  legs  sticking  out  in  all  directions,  and  the  davenport  raised  on  their  heads  at  least  two  feet  off  the  floor.   Safe  as  an  ostrich  in  a  tornado.  Out  at  First  National,  Ernest  Tor-  rence  came  tearing  out  of  his  dressing-  room.

Pm  Not  Broke/'  says  Gloria    "I've  enjoyed  everything  that  money  can  buy,"  says  Gloria,  "and  it  has  taught  me  that  real  things  are  free"    YOU  may  recall  those  front  page  newspaper  headlines  which  screamed  to  a  nation  recently  the  dire  distress  of  Gloria  Swanson.   They  told  how  Gloria  was  so  broke  in  Europe  that  she  didn't  have  the  price  of  a  ticket  back  home.  And  they  told  it  their  way,  without  Gloria  having  the  chance  to  tell  her  side  of  it  at  all.'   But  when  I  brought  up  the  query  on  those  newspaper  stories  she  didn't  wax  indignant.   She  merely  shrugged  her  shoulders.   "That  story  was  so  ridiculous,"  she  said,  "so  utterly  unfair  that  I  hate  to  give  it  the  importance  of  a  denial."   "But,"  she  asked  in  turn,  "why  does  everyone  think  being  broke  is  such  a  horrible  thing?  Why  does  everyone  put  such  high  value  on  things  which  can  so  easily  be  swept  away  by  one  stroke  of  Fate?   "I'm  not  really  broke.    How  could  I  be?"   And  no  one  would  have  doubted  that  statement  if  they  could  have  peeped  into  her  palatial  suite  at  one  of  Park  Avenue's  swankiest  hotels.   "But  I  have  a  few  opinions  on  the  subject,"  Gloria  explained.  "I've  been  living  in  Europe  where  people  are  on  the  mend  after  their  financial  disaster.  They've  already  gone  through  it  and  it   has   been   a  wonderful   experience  to  my  foreign  friends.   "People  have  learned  the  real  values  of  life  from  this  financial  upheaval.  Every  last  one  of  us  has  curtailed  expenses,  cut  out  extravagances,  let  ourselves  think  nor-  mally and  sanely  for  the  first  time  in  years.   "  You  see,  I  know  all  about  being  poor.    I  was  terribly  poor  while  I  was  struggling  for  a  place  in  filmdom.    I  know  all  about  doing  without  things  and  wanting  them  ter-  ribly.

That's  why  if  I  were  to  go  broke  tomorrow,  I  could  fill  the  gap  of  money  artificiality  with  the  real  things  of  life  which  are  free."   Gloria  was  wearing  a  simple  little  gown  of  chartreuse  satin,  a  dainty  bit  of  French  finery  which  she  admitted  she  had  picked  up  at  a  bargain.   "Don't  think  I'd  ever  attempt  to  tell  the  world  how  to  run  itself.  And  I  hope  I  don't  give  that  impression.  But  really,  you  just  can't  ignore  the  simple  beauty  of  living,  once  you've  absorbed  that  spirit  in  Europe.  Just  to  get  up  mornings  and  know  that  my  baby  will  smile  at  me;  just  to  walk  to  my  window  and  know  that  the  sun  will  be  shining  and  that  there  will  be  flowers  blooming  in  my  garden  is  heavenly  to  me.

"And  now  that  my  life  with  Mike  is  so  wonderfully  happy  I   feel  as  if  my  real  life  has  just  begun.     I  had  to  go  through  so   many  disappointments,  so  many  heartbreaking  disillusionments   in  order  to  see  what  is  before  me  now.    I  think  that's  how  we   learn  to  appreciate  the  finer  beauties  of  life  such  as  culture,  and   quiet  contentment.    These  things  cost  so  little  in  actual  money   value;  they  seem  to  be  earned  by  contrasts   and  experiences.    And  the  best  part  is  that   when  we  once  acquire  this  art — the  art  of   living — we  never  can  lose  it  no  matter  what   financial  disaster  happens  all  around  us."   And  this  brought  us  back  to  the  original   subject  of  whether  Gloria  was  broke  or  not.   "I   dislike  terribly  to  discuss  money,"   Gloria  said,  and  she  didn't  say  it  in   any  high-hat  manner,   either.

By  Harry  Lang    TAKE  an  average,  everyday  American  boy,  nine  or  ten  years  old —  Give  that  boy,  quite  suddenly,  such  wealth  as  not  one  little  boy  in  ten  million  might  ever  expect  to  possess.  Make  that  boy  "head  of  the  house" — head,  and  sole  wage-earner  of  a  household  which  in-  cludes himself,  his  mother,  his  grandmother,  his  uncle,  two  servants.  .  .  .   Imagine  him  "being  made  a  fuss  over"  by  famous  people  like  Joan  Crawford,  Tallulah  Bankhead,  Wallace  Beery,  Richard  Dix.   Imagine  him  seeing  his  own  picture  staring  at  him  from  billboards,  newspapers,  mag-  azines.   What,  do  you  suppose,  would  all  this  do  to  that  child?   We  have,  in  the  making  before  our  eyes  to-  day, precisely  such  a  boy  and  such  a  situation.   The  boy  is  Jackie  Cooper.  Incidentally,  that  is  not  his  real  name.  He  was  chris-  tened Richard.   He  was  born  in  Los  Angeles.  His  mother  is  a  young  woman  whose  professional  name  is  Mabel  Leonard.  His  father,  a  much  older  man,  was  known  on  the  vaudeville  stage  and  in  cafes  as  Johnny  Cooper,  entertainer.   Jackie  Cooper  never  knew  his  father.  When  Jackie  was  less  than  three  years  old,  Johnny  Cooper  walked  out  of  the  picture — simply  that.  Whether  he's  alive  or  dead  today,  Mabel  Leonard  does  not  know.  She  assumes  he's  dead — because  it  seems  natural  that  if  he  were  alive,  he'd  turn  up,  now  that  his  son  is  famous.    But  to  date,  he  hasn't.   Naturally,  as  soon  as  Jackie  grew  old  enough,  he  joined  in  the  family  struggle  for  living  money.  He  either  inherited  or  absorbed  enough  theatrical  ability  to  qualify,  eventually,  for  Hal  Roach's  "Our  Gang"  comedies.  From  Hal  Roach,  Jackie's  salary  was  $50  a  week,  when  he  worked.   That  brings  us  to  two  years  ago.  They  were  living  then  in  a  pseudo-Spanish  bungalow  of  stucco  construction.  Jackie's  life  was  already  deviating  from  the  normal  boy's.  Even  though  he  played  with  his  gang — like  the  usual  American  boy — and  had  a  thrown-together  "club  house"  in  his  back  yard,  he  didn't  go  to  school  with  them.

But  what  can  we  expect  when  he  has  his  art,  family  and  play  to  consider?    arranged  that  they  need  not  go  to  school;  their  studio  work  interferes.  These  movie  children  may  be  educated  at  the  studios,  while  they  work,  between  scenes.   THE  law  is  strict  enough.  A  certain  amount  of  time  has  to  be  given  to  education.  Qualified,  state-accepted  teachers  work  with  the  children — between  scenes,  during  those  long  waits  be-  tween "takes."  They  teach  the  children  the  same  things  taught  in  public  schools.   At  home  Jackie  has  his  private  teacher — a  sweet,  grayish-  haired  schoolma'am — who  comes  to  the  Cooper  home  at  nine  o'clock  each  morning,  stays  until  noon.  In  those  three  hours,  she  tries  to  give  nine-year-old  Jackie  Cooper  the  fundamentals  of  spelling,  writing,  arithmetic,  such  elementary  studies.  It's  not  easy,  because  Jackie  manages  to  find  repeated  more-or-less  legitimate  excuses  for  temporary  escapes.  But  that's  normal,  certainly.

That  is  their  challenge  to  "Depression"    38    Holly    woo    d   Iake  It  r    HOLLYWOOD  has  at  last  discovered  that  there  is  a  law  of  com-  pensation. Just  as  in  bonanza  days  the  motion  pic-  ture industry  enjoyed  a  super-prosperity,  so,  in  depression  days,  it  is  suffering  an  aggravated  adversity.  For  Hollywood  has  always  been  the  abode  of  extremes.   Since  the  inception  of  the  film  industry,  Hollywood  has  par-  alleled a  mining  camp.  With  the  discovery  of  the  mother-locle  it  went  hog  wild.  Waste  and  extravagance  were  the  order  of  every  day.   It  did  not  seem  to  matter,  then.  Funds  were  apparently  as  inexhaustible  as  the  weird  ideas  that  swallowed  them.  Literally  speaking,  Hollywood  has  always  used  motion  picture  money.  One  million,  two  millions,  as  high  as  seven  millions  for  a  single  picture;  five  millions,  ten  millions  for  new  stages,  new  mechan-  isms, new  equipment.  Nobody  stopped  to  consider  how  it  was  to  be  gotten  back.  Expansion.  Stock  issues  Super-supers.  Orgies  of  financing,  production  and  theater  accumulation.  Then — exhaustion.   Just  now,  Hollywood  is  not  mincing  words.  It  is  calling  a  spade  a  spade  and  itself  a  fool.  The  seemingly  endless  sources  of  revenue  all  dried  up  at  once,  and  Hollywood  found  itself  without  a  dime  for  the  rainy  day.  The  rainy  day  dawned  like  the  inevitable  morning  after.  And  Hollywood  found  itself  with  a  fierce  financial  headache  following  a  prolonged  spree.   With  the  bank  holiday  virtually  all  of  Hollywood  went  on  half  or  three-quarter  pay.   From  colossal  extravagance  Hollywood  turned  to  cuts.  Cut  salaries,  cut  production,  cut  overhead.  Cut  everything.  Cut  to  the  bone.    Cut  until  it  hurt — and  then,  cut.   One  big  studio  cut  all  its  employees  four  times,  and  then,  in  pursuance  to  the  blanket  agreement,  cut  what  was  left  in  half.   Reorganization  is  the  order  of  the  day.  Even  as  in  Joseph's  dream,  the  lean  years  are  following  hard  upon  the  fat  ones.  But  unlike  the  Egyptians  whom  Joseph  warned,  Hollywood's  financial  storehouses  ran  empty.   Can  Hollywood  "take  it"?  The  crisis  has  come  and  the  piper  must  be  paid — and  what  is  Hollywood's  tune?   YES,  Hollywood  is  currently  feeling  the  business  depression  which  spread  itself  like  a  wet  blanket  over  the  entire  world.  Hollywood  is  perhaps  more  acutely  affected  because  its  own  business  is  directly  reflected  by  every  Paducah  Corners  every-  where. It  is  feeling  the  recent  nation-wide  bank  holiday,  which  lost  to  it  irretrievable  millions  in  theater  admissions.  It  is  feeling  its  own  earthquake,  and  the  re-  sultant losses  thereof.  It  is  feel-  ing the  weight  of  that  Old  Man  of  the  Sea — its  debts  and  extrav-  agances —  astride  its  shoulders.  In  toto,  Hollywood  is  feeling  the  combination  and  the  culmina-  tion of  an  extraordinary  chain  of  circumstances.  And  so  Holly-  wood has  hit  bottom.  And  be-  cause it  dropped  from  such  a  dizzy  height  to  such  a  corre-  sponding depth,  the  shock  is  all  the  greater.   To  a  people  who  have  always  lived  on  black  bread  and  potato  soup,  a  continued  diet  of  black  bread  and  potato  soup  is  no  hardship.  But  Hollywood  has  always  been  a  community  of  hors  d'ouvres  and  caviar.  Here  the  mushroomed  shacks  of  the  mining  camp  have  been  ornate  mansions.  Hollywood's  gold  has  been    resplendent    even   in   her    By   Reginald    Taviner    '"THIS  article,  "Can  Hollywood  'Take  It'?"  necessarily  goes  to  press  before  issues  are  settled.  Yet  it  would  be  hard  to  conceive  of  a  new  set  of  business  or  economic  conditions  that  would  stop  or  even  impede  the  steps  taken  for  retrench-  ment and  reorganization  throughout  the  entire  industry.   The  directors  and  actors  cheerfully  ac-  quiesced in  the  pay  cuts  they  were  asked  to  take.  At  the  present  writing  some  of  those  cuts  have  been,  at  least,  partially  cancelled,  and  all  lost  pay  may  be  re-  stored.   Hollywood  has  been  through  a  terrific  ordeal,  but  n:>  one  lost  his  head  or  his  courage.    bathtubs,  and  she  has  bathed  in  milk  and  honey.  She  has  been  the  chorus  girl  on  the  world  stage,  beautiful  and  glittering  and  bespangled.  And  now  she  is  reduced  to  a  diet  of  beans.   How  is  she  taking  it?  Is  there  true  stamina  behind  her  strident  smile?  When  the  frosting  is  knocked  off,  what  of  the  cake  beneath?  What  is  the  spirit  of  this  emergency,  and  what  will  determine  the  future?   Currently,  Hollywood's  economic  condition  is  little  short  of  chaotic.  There  can  be  no  question  about  it,  and  Hollywood,  showman  to  the  core,  is  the  first  to  admit  it.  But  the  show  must  go  on,  and  Hollywood  is  working  out  its  own  salvation.  Its  present  symptoms  are  painful,  but  healthy.  It  will  eat  no  more  green  apples,  will  grandiloquently  toss  away  no  more  millions.  It  has  learned  its  lesson,  has  learned  that  its  mushroom  financial  growth  must  be  shorn  away  and  replaced  by  a  basically  sound  foundation.   NO  business  can  indefinitely  continue  spending  two  dollars  for  every  dollar  that  comes  in.  Hollywood  has  been  doing  just  that  for  years.  And  it  looked  as  though  the  outside  sources  would  never  cease  pouring  in  their  wealth.  But  now  that  the  inpouring  has  ceased,  most  emphatically  Hollywood  is  left  holding  the  bag.   Previously  the  bankers  had  been  turning  greedy  eyes  towards  the  movie  bonanza,  and  their  avowed  purpose  had  been  to  acquire  control  of  it  themselves.  So  they  opened  up  the  purse-  strings  and  showered  the  whole  wad  into  Hollywood's  lap.  And  Hollywood,  true  to  its  extravagant  self,  scattered  the  gold  with  lavish  hand.  Each  producing  company  sought  to  outdo  the  other — and  did.  While  they  were  doing  it,  the  bankers  sought  to  make  hay  while  the  sun  shone — and  did.   When  the  first  crash  came,  the  bankers,  pointing  to  their  staggering  loans,  said  that  they  would  assume  charge  and  run  things.  They  did  that,  too,  with  the  result  that  the  motion  picture  industry  tottered.  The  bankers  thereupon  withdrew  in  haste,  drawing  their  purse-strings  tightly  shut  behind  them  and  leaving  Hollywood  to  paddle  its  own  canoe  out  of  the  resultant  whirlpool.   At  the  present  time  Hollywood's  position  is  identically  that  of  the  home  owner  who,  in  flush  times,  assumed  a  mortgage  vastly  greater  than  currently  shrunken  values  are  worth.  Not  content  with  expanding  its  film  factories  with  their  gigantic   overhead,  it  reached  into  the  theater  field  as  well,  buying  chains  of  houses  at  peak  prices  and  running  them  at  a  loss.  Hollywood  suffered  from  a  delu-  sion of  aggrandisement,  dream-  ing that  it  had  all  the  money  in  the  world.    THE  first  step  after  the  debacle  was  to  get  rid  of  these  houses  with  their  sky-high  leases  and  cumulative  losses.  That  is  why  the  subsidiary  theater  companies  were  the  first  to  go  into  receiver-  ships. By  divesting  themselves  of  these  theaters,  the  parent  com-  panies hoped  to  save  their  pro-  duction units;  but  it  was  too  late.  The  millions  which  had  been  "written  off"  in  the  past  were  not  in  reality  written  off  at  all.  Actual  losses  cannot  be  just  crossed  from  the  books,  as  Holly-  wood found  out.  They  must  be  paid — paid  in  depleted  reserves,  overdue  loans,  shrunken  operat-  ing capital.

Oliver  and  Stan  can  really  laugh  at  life's  little  jokes  now  for  they  went  through  plenty  on  their  way  up.    But,  look  out,  Laurel's  likely  to  burst  out  cryin'  any  minute  all  over  his  nice  bib   lear-otained  Laughter    WHERE  did  Laurel  and  Hardy  find  out  that  tears  could  be  made  to  pay — as  comedy  material?  How  did  this  inimitable  team  learn  to  splice  weeping  with  laughter?   The  roars  of  laughter  that  greet  even  their  names  as  they  are  flashed  on  the  screen  are,  in  a  sense,  echoes  of  the  poverty,  hunger,  rebuffs,  all  but  death-dealing  blows  that  made  this  laughter  possible.   Stan  and  Oliver  were  total  strangers  to  the  kindly  fates  until  Lady  Luck  made  them  screen  partners.  The  lives  of  each  are  almost  as  alike  as  two  peas  except  that  Laurel's  started  in  England  and  Hardy's  in  America.   Stan  was  trained  in  the  same  school  as  Charlie  Chaplin.  The  English  music  'alls.  When  barely  in  his  'teens,  Stan  trouped  with  the  renowned  Charlie  in  the  vehicle  that  took  them  both  to  America — and  world  fame.  Oliver's  stage  "prep"  school  was  minstrel  shows  in  the  "sticks,"  and  small-time  vaudeville.   When  Stan  Laurel's  well-to-do  father  in  England  sternly  said  "no"  to  his  becoming  a  "comic,"  the  boy  ran  away,  de-  termined to  arrive  on  his  own.   Because  Oliver  Hardy's  widowed  mother  down  in  Georgia  had  to  slave  to  support  five  offspring,  he  joined  a  barnstorming  troupe  to  ease  her  burden.   Their  persistent  jinxes  seldom  lost  sight  of  either  lad  after  that.   Even  today,  secure  as  they  are  in  the  cinema's  arena  of  plenty,  tears  well  in  Stan's  sad  eyes  as  he  recalls  the  times  when,  penniless  in  strange  lands,  he  T>    .     TC<        n   felt   his   frail    body    couldn't    cling    to   life        *-*  J    ^ '     JX    against  continued  hunger,  while  a  lump  rises  in  Oliver's  silvery  throat  as  he  speaks  of  how  he,  alone  and  "broke,"  lay  fever-  ridden  in  a  cheap  lodging  house,  awaiting  the  end  he  believed  inevitable.   The  smell  of  grease  paint  was  in  Stan's  nostrils  almost  from  his  first  "howling"  appearance  as  a  "blessed  event"  in  Ulverson,  England,  1895.  As  a  true  child  of  show  folks,  Stanley  Jefferson  made  his  stage  debut  in  a  carried-on  part.  Dressing-rooms  were  his  nursery,  theater  alleys  his  playground.   AT  ten  came  the  urge  for  a  comedy  career.   The  "governor,"  who  was  acquiring  a  chain  of  theaters  throughout  Britain,  had  other  plans  for  his  son.   But  the  fledgling  took  wing,  short-changing  his  name  to  Stan  Laurel,  and  bummed  his  way  to  London.  Here  his  grit  was  immediately  put  to  the  test.   A  clever  pantomimist  despite  his  tender  age,  Stan  was  limited  in  his  search  for  work  by  his  father's  wide  acquaintance  among  theatrical  people.  He  knew  they  would  report  his  whereabouts  to  his  family.  For  twenty  months  he  battled  starvation  with  occasional  work.  London  park  benches  became  his  beds.  He  soon  learned  where  and  when  the  bread-  lines formed.   Stan  thought  he  glimpsed  sunbeams  peeping  through  the  fog  when  he  was  signed  for  a  tent  show  in  Holland.  But,  so  eager  was  he  for  the  opportunity,  he  failed  to  notice  a  clause  in  the  contract — no  salaries  in  case  of  rain.   And    the   skies   belched   water   for   three  Afn  n  h         whole  weeks  after  his  arrival  in  the  land  of  •     -L'J-iJUn  windmills  and  wooden  shoes!    It  took  years  of  heartbreak  and  hard  knocks  to  give  Laurel  and  Hardy  the  gift  for  packing  them  in  with  "pathos  behind  the  smile"    A  mere  kid,  stranded,  he  couldn't  speak  the  language.  His  back  was  against  the  wall.  He  stood  in  shop  doorways  through  long,  wet  nights  with  odors  from  bakery  basements  aggravating  his  gnawing  emptiness.  The  lad  remembered  his  vision  be-  came blurred.  Then  he  collapsed.  He  came  back  to  con-  sciousness in  a  hospital.  As  food  restored  him  to  strength,  Stan  discovered  the  Dutch  authorities  intended  to  deport  him.  Knowing  that  this  move  would  restore  him  to  paternal  custody,  he  fled  and  panhandled  his  way  across  the  Channel.   Back  in  London,  Stan  tripped  over  a  new  stumbling  block.  His  father  had  a  private  detective  agency  looking  for  him.  He  could  look  for  work  only  in  the  very  out-of-the-way  places.   But,  as  the  fuss  over  his  disappearance  let  down,  Stan  got  his  break  with  Fred  Karno's  English  Comedians,  with  Chaplin  featured.  The  pay  was  only  three  shillings  a  day — but  he  could  eat  on  that.     His  idea  of  disguise  fooled  his  dad's  sleuths.   OLIVER  HARDY  came  into  the  world  in  1892  in  a  setting  very  close  to  show  business,  or  at  least  very  much  part  of  "trouping" — a  small  hotel  in  Madison,  Georgia,  owned  by  his  father.  It  was  his  baby  home  for  only  eighteen  months  when  his  father  died.  His  mother  tried  to  run  the  business,  but  mortgage  payments  far  outdistanced  the  meager  receipts.  So  she  took  her  brood  to  Atlanta.   When  Oliver  was  five,  life  handed  him  his  first  severe  jolt,  the  start  of  a  long  series.  His  mother  had  always  made  her  children  believe  that  Santa  Claus  was  a  most  generous  soul,  for  up  to  then  she  had  been  able,  by  dint  of  hard  work,  to  decorate  their  Christmas  tree  with  several  gifts  for  each.  But  the  sugar  bowl  bank  was  empty.  Now  she  was  forced  to  tell  them  the  dream-blasting  truth!   "Mother  did  what  she  thought  was  the  square  thing,"  Oliver  sadly  reminisced,  "but  we  were  so  young  to  be  dis-  illusioned— and  there  were  so  many  blows  awaiting  us  later  on."   The  incident  stands  out  to  Hardy,  the  man,  as  vividly  as  it  did  to  Oliver,  the  child.    It  accounts  for  the  loads  of  presents  he  now  sends  to  Los   Angeles  orphanages  every  Christmas!   At  six  he  was  a  newsboy  in  Atlanta,  collecting  extra  pen-  nies singing  for  his  customers.  At  ten  a  roving  minstrel  outfit  billed  him  as  "the  boy  tenor."   Beaten  and  starved  by  drunk-  en members  of  the  company,  the  boy  was  not  a  minstrel  long.  He  stood  the  abuse  as  long  as  he  could  because  of  his  mother's  urgent  need  for  his  contribu-  tions. But,  when  his  chunky  body  became  a  mass  of  bruises  and  cuts,  he  took  French  leave,  returning  to  Atlanta  in  a  box  car.   WITH  his  mother  employed  and  hisbrothersandsisters  doing  odd  jobs,  Oliver  was  able  to  go  back  to  school.  But  his  vacations  were  spent  in  vaude-  ville.   Oliver's  bulk  belied  his  young  years,  so  he  had  fairly  frequent  singing  jobs  in  Atlanta  cabarets.  They  helped  him  through  high  school  and  two  years  of  law  study  in  the  University  of  Georgia.   He  had  not  yet  attained  vot-  ing age  when  the  family  money  problem  made  him  put  away  his  law  books  and  head  for  New  York  in  search  of  gold  on  the  stage.   Broadway  stage  doors  opened  to  him  for  try-outs  which  didn't  become  engagemen-ts,  so  he  turned  movieward  as  an  extra.    Stan  Laurel  posed  for  this  at  the  ripe  age  of  two.  But  even  then  didn't  he  show  a  hint  of  the  picked-on    Stan  who's   such  a  riot  today?    Hiking  through  a  blizzard  from  a  studio  to  save  the  carfare  that  meant  cheese  and  crackers  to  him,  he  caught  a  heavy  cold,  awakening  next  morning  in  his  five  by  seven  hall  room,  too  sick  to  lift  his  head  off  the  roll  of  clothing  that  served  as  pillow.  There  he  fought  off  delirium  as  his  condition  grew  worse.  He  was  afraid  to  call  for  help;  the  hawk-faced  landlady  would  demand  the  already  overdue  rent.   For  seventy-two  hours  he   tossed  on  the  hard,   narrow   bed,  his  temperature  mounting   rapidly,   his   parched   throat   craving  water  that  was  not  to   be  had.       Then  he  lapsed  into   unconsciousness.   In  that  grim  plight  a  pal,  in  New  York  for  a  holiday,  found   him,  and  rushed  for  a  doctor.    Pneumonia  had  almost  got  him.   In  191 1  Karno  booked  passage  on  a  cattle  boat  for  his  fourteen   comedians,  including  Chaplin  and  Laurel,  and  sent  them  to   America.

Faced  with  overwrought  nerves,  she  saved  the  day —  with  a  wisecrack    "Laugh  and  the  world  laughs  with  you,"  is  Marion  Davies'  remedy  for  all  ills.  Don't  you  think  she  looks  it  here,  as  she  will  appear  in  "Peg  O'  My  Heart"?    THIS  was  the  darnedest  interview  .  .  .  !  You  see,  when  you  go  to  talk  with  a  beautiful  movie  star  in  her  own  home  on  a  quiet  Sunday  afternoon,  you  certainly  don' I  expect  to  have  a  hundred  and  fifty-foot  cliff  come  thundering  down  in  a  terrific  landslide  to  the  very  front  door.  Or  to  have  two  terrified  utter  strangers,  who'd  been  watching  you  from  atop  the  hundred  and  fifty-foot  height  one  moment,  dumped  the  very  next  at  your  feet  in  a  welter  of  dirt  and  dust  and  bruises  and  excitement?   Yet  that's  exactly  what  happened  in  the  middle  of  this  inter-  view with  Marion  Davies,  at  her  California  beach  home  at  the  base  of  the  Santa  Monica  Palisades!   And  oddly  coincidental  though  it  may  seem,  the  accident  (in  which  only  one  of  those  inexplicable  miracles  saved  the  two  victims  from  death  or  serious  injury!)  gave  Marion  a  perfect  chance  to  prove  the  truth  of  the  philosophy  she'd  just  been  expounding!   It  was  like  this:  Marion  had  just  been  saying  that  to  her,  a  laugh  was  one  of  the  most  worthwhile  things  in  life,  and  the  best  medicine.  At  that  moment  came  the  landslide,  and  two  bruised,  shocked,  stunned  people — a  Los  Angeles  dentist  and  his  wife — were  carried  into  the  Davies  home,  nearest  to  the  accident.  Not  knowing  how  seriously  they  were  hurt,  the  •  two  were  as  near  collapse  as  two  people   might  be;  the  experience  was,  naturally,  D  TT  J   terrifying.      Then    Marion    entered    the  D  J      n  Cl  '  '  J      ^  CI  II  g    room.     She  was  kind,  she  was  sweet,  she  saw  that  they  were  cared  for  while  the  doctors  were  on  their  way —   — and  then  that  God-given  sense  of  humor  for  which  Hollywood  loves  her,  came  to  the  front.   Marion  grinned  the  Irish  kid's  grin  of  hers,  made  a  startling  unexpected  wisecrack  (you'll  read  that  later).  For  a  moment,  there  was  aston-  ished silence.  The  victims  of  the  slide  stared  at  her  for  a  moment,  then  the  man  chuckled.  His  wife  smiled  broadly.  Forgetting     their   shock,  their  pain  in  the  panacea  of  a  laugh,  the  man  came  right  back  at  Marion  with  a  wise-  crack to  match  her  own!  He  laughed,  his  wife  laughed,  Marion  laughed,  everybody  laughed.   And  when  the  doctors  ar-  rived, they  had  little  to  do  save  patch  up  a  cut  or  two,  fix  up  some  bruises,  and  say:  "Well,  it's  a  good  thing  they  saw  a  laugh  in  it — because  if  they  hadn't  been  able  to  give  vent  to  their  shock  in  laughter,  it  might  have  laid  them  cold,  with  serious  consequences.  Shock  is  often  more  dangerous  than  actual  injury."   So  let's  begin  at  the  beginning  of  this  bizarre  interview.    FIRST,  an  "inside"  fact:  The  reason  you've  not  seen  many  interviews  with  Marion  Davies  is  simply  that,  next  to  Garbo,  she's  about  the  toughest  person  in  Hollywood  to  get  to  talk.  For  publication,  that  is.  Though  it's  not  generally  known.  Because,  unlike  Garbo,  the  Davies'  reticence  hasn't  been  publicized,  made  publicity  capital  of  as  has  Greta's.  But  it's  there.  It's  not  because  Marion  doesn't  like  people,  but  simply  because,  in  the  presence  of  an  interviewer,  she  becomes  as  embarrassed,  as  self-conscious,  as  tongue-tied,  as  a  little  boy  at  his  first  party.    So  she  dodges  them.   But  even  more  than  she's  self-conscious  and  interview-shy,  she's  a  wonderfully  good  sport.  And  loves  to  do  things  for  other  people.  So  your  interviewer  played  a  trick  on  her.  He  knew,  as  Hollywood  does,  that  she's  always  laughing,  never  "moody"  like  so  many  other  stars;  that  she  is  noted  for  her  cheeriness,  her  jollity  on  the  set.    So  he  said  to  her:   "Marion,  this  is  a  swell  time  to  help  people  cheer  up.

Bette  knew  Mr.  Arliss  objected  to  bedroom  scenes — even  innocent  ones — and  had  thought  pajamas  would  make  her  more  modest.  She  timidly  attempted  to  explain.

No  fish  or  animals  in  an  Arliss  script.  The  honorable  Englishman  has  expended  a  modest  fortune  in  helping  humane  societies.   And  there  are  no    scenes  where  he  eats  meat.  He  and  Mrs.  Arliss  are  vegetarians,  you'll  remember.   A  portrait  of  a  woman  who  is  supposed  to  be  Bette  Davis'  mother  in  her  girlhood  hangs  over  the  mantel  piece  in  "The  Working  Man."  The  studio  employed  a  high-priced    An  Arliss  film  must  be  as  he  wants  it.  Thoroughly  moral!  This  scene  with  Bette  Davis,  from  "The  Working  Man,"  is  typical  of  Arliss'  at-  titude in  such  matters    artist  to  paint  a  picture  of  Bette  in  old-fashioned  clothes  that  the  portrait  might  be  truly  realistic.   Mr.  Arliss  glanced  at  it  and  ordered  it  removed.  He  didn't  wish  to  imply  that  an  old  man  was  falling  in  love  with  a  girl  young  enough  to  be  his  daughter!  Furthermore,  he  did  not  believe  there  would  be  such  an  exact  likeness  between  mother  and  daughter.   WHEN  Arliss  was  inspecting  the  script  for  "Alexander  Hamilton,"  he  came  upon  a  bedroom  scene  between  himself  and  June  Collyer.  Mr.  Arliss  shook  his  head.  No  bedroom  scenes  in  his  pictures.   Although  he  had  played  this  scene  with  Jeanne  Eagels  on  the  stage  and  taken  the  young  lady  to  an  apartment,  pictures  were  different.  People  chose  their  plays.  They  had  their  movie  entertainment  thrust  upon  them.   The  script  was  changed.  June  Collyer  called  to  him  from  the  top  of  the  stairs  to  come  and  get  his  cloak.  They  would  cut  at  the  door  of  the  bedroom.   Again,  Mr.  Arliss  shook  his  head.  The  bedroom  door  was  too  obvious.    They  would  cut  at  the  top  of  the  stairs.   When  the  scene  was  actually  taken,  they  cut  at  the  bottom  of  the  stairs.  His  foot  on  the  lowest  stair  was  the  only  indication  Mr.  Arliss  would  give  that  he  might  be  approaching  a  lady's  bedroom!   Here  is  a  list  of  Mr.  Arliss'  principal  leading  ladies:  Doris  Kenyon;  June  Collyer;  Alice  Joyce;  Mrs.  George  Arliss;  Mary  Astor.

That  night — nausea.  Doctors  called.  A  temperature  of  103.  A  slight  concussion.  Nevertheless,  she  tried  to  work  on  the  morrow.  Relapse.  The  concussion  passed  off,  leaving  no  ill  effects.  Proving  that  Marlene  is  in  tip-top  physical  condition.  And,  of  course,  one  of  those  who  worried  the  most  was  Brian  Aherne,  her  leading  man.  And — but  half  the  men  in  Hollywood  worry  about  Marlene  if  she  even  sneezes.

And  here  was  Josef  back  before  Marlene  even  finished  her  current  picture,  "The  Song  of  Songs. "   Marlene  is  changing  her  mind  about  Holly-  wood these  days.  Maybe  the  uncertain  accept-  ance of  the  German  people  in  contrast  to  the  certain  adulation  of  the  American  people  may  be  the  reason.   At  any  rate,  Josef  Yon  Sternberg  is  on  his  way  to  the  Orient  and  Marlene  seems  more  contented  than  ever  in  America.   rT'0  you,  George  Bernard  Shaw,  but  to  Kathryn  Carver  (Mrs.  Adolphe  Menjou)  he's  plain  "Georgie."

That  bit  of  business  where  John    presents  his  princely  paw  to  Diana  Wynyard  for  the  customary  salute.   The  young  lady  promptly  bites  the  hand  instead  of  kissing  it  as  the  Prince  obviously  expected.   Well,  it  was  done  once,  but  not  to  the  director's  liking.   The  second  time  Mr.  Barrymore  put  on  a  much  more  spirited  performance— so  much  so  that  he  accidentally  slapped  Miss  Wynyard  with  the  back  of  his  hand  and  disconcerted  her  so  that  she  was  completely  bowled  over.

TT'S  a  strange  coincidence  that  Gloria  Swanson  and  her  husband,  Michael  Farmer,  should  arrive  in  Hollywood  exactly  at  the  same  time  as  Connie  Bennett  and  her  husband,  the  Marquis.   Since  Connie's  marriage  to  Gloria's  former  husband,  things  have  been  slightly  strained,  to  say  the  least,  between  the  two.

We  went  to  one  of  those  cute  little  restaurants  in  a  side  street  for  lunch  today.  I  ate  snails  and  liked  them.  I  had  pressed  duck,  also.  Supposed  to  be  some-  thing like  the  twenty-five  thousandth  duck  they'd  served  there  since  the  place  opened.  Rex  said,  "Punkin,  I  never  thought  you'd  come  to  this,"  and  I  said,  "When  in  Paris,  eat  as  the  Parisians  do."   And  when  in  Paris,  try  to  order  your  meals  in  French  was  my  motto.     But  I  guess  I'd  better  change  my  mind.   Gee,  these  French  waiters  and  maids  are  the  dumb  clucks.  Lost  my  temper  good  and  plenty  yesterday.  Started  reading  my  order  from  the  menu  in  French  and  that  garcon  just  stood  there  with  his  mouth  open — and  kept  on  repeating  in  French,  "What  is  it  Madame  wishes?"   I  said,  "Can't  you  understand  me?"  But  he  kept  standing  there  with  a  pencil  in  one  hand  ready  to  take  the  order  and  his  clean  napkin  in  the  other,  shaking  his  head  in  a  kind  of  silly  way  and  smiling  so  politely.  Everybody  is  always  smiling  here —  you  never  know  whether  they  are  mad  or  glad.  It  gives  you  a  very  funny  feeling.   Well,  he  upset  me  so,  standing  there,  that  I  started  talking  loud.     Then  he  got  mad  and  started  shouting  back.     "I  guess,"    "I  was  kind  of  crying  — I  could  see  those  men  so  clearly,  lying  in  the  trenches.  .  .  .

Do  you  think  you  would  get  me  if  I  pointed?"   Finally,  the  head  waiter  came  and  apologized,  and  took  the  order  himself  in  English  .  .  .  Foreigners  arc  funny.

When  the  driver  takes  a  corner  on  one  wheel,  you  feel  as  if  you're  going  to  come  apart.   Saw  Napoleon's  tomb  and  those  gar-  dens near  the  Louvre  where  the  fountains  are  all  lit  up  at  night  and  look  like  a  carnival.  Saw  lots  of  old-fashioned  pictures  in  the  Louvre.  Some  of  the  colors  were  wonderful,  but  you  get  so  tired  walking  down  miles  of  dingy  corri-  dors.

Oh  boy,  what  will  my  figure  be  like  when  I  get  home!   Jan.  7  th. — It's  very  funny  how  in  Gay  Paree  all  the  men  insist  on  "keesing  ze  hand  and  making  ze  compliments  magni-  fiques."  I  always  wanted  to  say  like  the  girl  in  "Gentlemen  Prefer  Blondes" — a  kiss  on  the  hand  is  nice,  but  a  diamond  wrist-watch  lasts  forever.  Only  I  didn't  because  I  thought  that  might  hurt  their  feelings.   Over  here  they  laugh  at  such  different  things.  We've  been  to  two  shows  already  which  everybody  said  were  the  swellest  in  Paris.  Supposed  to  be  funny,  with  grand  music  and  knock-  out choruses.  One  was  the  "P'olies  Bergeres."  They  think  Americans  won't  die  happy  without  seeing  this  at  least  once.    Well,  all  I  can  say  is:  "Was  my  face  red?"  Oh  boy,  Will  Hays  ought  to  come  over  here  and  "geeve  a  look."  He'd  never  be  so  hard  on  poor  Hollywood  after  that.  I  thought  the  show  was  very  embar-  rassing. .  .  .   The  other  show  with  Josephine  Baker  wasn't  so   bad — but  I  couldn't  rave.      I'll  take  a  Broadway   stage  hit  any  time  now  and  be  perfectly  satisfied.   I  guess  the  entertainment  is  different  in  every  country  you   strike.    I  guess  what  we're  used  to  seems  best  to  us.    Anyway,   it's  American  humor  for  me  every  time!   Jan.  8th. — There  was  an  old  man  who  kept  writing  up  to  us  at  the  George  V  Hotel.  Said  he  was  starving  and  that  his  wife  and  children  were  destitute,  and  wouldn't  I  help  him.   We  keep  on  getting  letters  like  this  every  day.  Because  over  here  people  seem  to  think  that  all  American  movie  stars  are  multi-millionaires  who  ride  around  in  a  different  colored  Rolls-Royce  every  day  and  light  their  cigarettes  with  ten  dollar  bills.  We  were  swamped  with  requests,  and  I  had  to  turn  them  over  to  a  stenographer.  .  .  .   But  the  letters  from  that  old  man  kept  bothering  me.  They  seemed  different  from  the  rest — more  sincere.  I  kept  thinking  about  him  at  night.  Tried  to  picture  him  to  myself.  Worried  so  I  could  hardly  sleep.  .  .  .  So  one  day  I  said  to  Rex:  "Honey,  we've  got  to  ask  this  old  guy  up  here  to  our  place."  And  Rex  said,  "Anything  you  say,  Punkin."   So  one  day  when  Rex  and  I  were  staying  in  because  the  weather  was  so  bad,  the  old  man  came  up.   He  was  sixty  years  old,  with  a  face  like  a  saint.  White  beard  and  deep,  sort  of  fiery  eyes.  He  talked  seven  languages  and  you  could  see  he  was  terribly  well  educated.  When  he  started  to  tell  us  his  story,  how  his  wife  was  so  sick  and  under-  nourished; how  he  had  one  son  who  was  deaf  and  dumb;  and  how  they  owed  forty  dollars  rent — I  almost  broke  down.  He  was  sincere,  there  was  no  doubt  about  it.  I've  been  fooled  so  many  times  now,  I  think  I  can  tell  the  fakers  from  the  real  ones.   Between  us,  we  managed  to        [  please  turn  to  page  102  ]   53    Sylvia    THE  first  time  I  ever  saw  Helen  Twelvetrees  her  face  was  all  red  and  swollen.  Had  that  girl  been  crying!   She  had  just  signed  a  con-  tract with  the  Pathe  Studios  and  you'd  have  thought  she  would  have  been  happy  about  it,  but  she  wasn't.  Helen  had  had  a  bitter  experience  at  another  studio.  She  had  had  the  usual  ballyhoo  that  they  give  a  new  contract  player,  but  she  just  didn't  click.  It  wasn't  Helen's  fault.  She  had  bad  stories  and  yet  she  couldn't  get  it  out  of  her  head  that  she  was  a  failure.  But  that  wasn't  the  only  reason  for  turning  on  the  tears.   She  was  divorcing  her  hus-  band and  what  she  told  me  about  that!  But  giving  advice  on  marriage  wasn't  my  job  just  then.  I  had  a  job,  and  a  big  one.  I  was  working  for  the  studio  and  had  to  get  Helen  to  look  okay.  From  all  the  worrying  and  the  crying  she  was  nervous  and  run  down,  and  she  certainly  couldn't  have  gone  before  the  camera  with  that  swollen  face.   I  didn't  have  to  take  off  any  flesh.     She  was  plenty  thin  at   the  time — except  for  her  legs  and  ankles — but  I  had  to  take  the  crying  lines  out  of  that  beautiful  face  of  hers.  It  was  a  little  different  from  anything  I  had  done  before  and  I  want  to  tell  you  all  about  it,  for  so  many  people  right  now  are  unhappy.  So  listen  to  me,  you  girls  who  have  to  let  off  steam  every  now  and  then  with  a  good  cry — you  mustn't  forget  to  take  care  of  your  faces  in  distressing  times  like  these.  Now  I'm  going  to  tell  you  how  I  treated  Helen  Twelvetrees.   As  I  told  you  her  face  was  swollen  and  red  with  crying;  yet  every  muscle  was  tense  because  she  knew  that  having  failed  at  another  studio  she  simply  had  to  make  good  at  Pathe.  My  job  was  to  get  her  in  shape  to  do  her  work.  I  had  to  relax  as  well  as  stimulate  the  glands  of  the  face  and  I'll  tell  you  how,  so  you  can  do  the  same.   First  of  all,  clean  the  face  with  a  good  cold  cream — and  right  here  let  me  tell  you  one  thing,  use  the  best  and  purest  cream  you  can  buy.  That  doesn't  always  mean  the  most  expensive  cream — but  be  sure  it  is  good!  Then  with  cold  cream  on  the  fingertips  begin  massaging  the  back  of  the  neck.  That's  the  way  to  begin  a  facial  always — that  relaxes  the  muscles.     Dig   5i    How  Oylvia  Cured   A  GAIN  Sylvia  tells  how  a  distressing  problem  yielded  to  her  skilled  treatment  -**- — this  time  for  Helen  Twelvetrees,  who  was  in  danger  of  ruining  her  film  chances  through  incessant  crying.  And,  as  always,  Sylvia  explains  how  you  can  use  the  same  treatments  right  in  your  home,  should  you  need  them.   Also,  Sylvia  has  agreed  to  place  the  skilled  knowledge  that  made  her  America's  most  famous  physical  cultitrisl  and  masseuse,  at  the  disposal  of  all  Photoplay  readers  who  want  health  advice.

Then  with  the  flat  of  the  hand  rub  the  neck  very  gently  just  under  each  ear  and  work  across  the  shoulders,  with  the  flats  of  the  hands,  digging  into  the  back  muscles  with  the  finger-  tips. Do  you  get  the  idea?  You'll  begin  to  feel  better  at  once!   Now  put  some  fresh  cold  cream  on  your  hands  and  with  the  palms  of  both  hands  rub  from  the  tip  of  the  chin  down  to  the  breast  bone,  cupping  your  hands  underneath  the  chin,  but  never  dig-  ging the  fingers  into  the  throat;  and  that  is  also  grand  for  double  chins.  It  will  make  your  neck  nice  and  firm,  too.   Now  that  you're  re-  laxed, you  can  start  on  that  weepy  face.  Put  cold  cream  on  the  two  middle  fingers  of  each  hand  and  very  gently,  in  a  rotary  movement  and  working  upwards,  begin  at  the  chin  bone  and  go  to  the  cheek  bone  all  over  the  face.  At  the  cheek  bone  carry  this  movement  outwards  to  the  temples.  Doesn't  that  make  you  feel  good?  In  the  same  way,  with  those  two  middle  fingers,  gently  massage  the  upper  lip.   Helen  Twelvetrees'  nose  used  to  get  all  swollen  from  weeping,  and  here's  how  to  handle  that.  With  those  same  middle  two  fingers  rub  down  the  middle  of  the  nose  to  the  tip  and  then  on  each  side  of  the  nose,  letting  the  fingers  move  gently  out  to  the  temple.  Very  gently  model  the  nose  as  if  it  were  just  so  much  putty — and  that's  what  it  looks  like  after  a  cry.   NOW  for  the  eyes.  Be  sure  to  take  cold  cream  off  the  fingers  and  don't  let  any  cream  get  into  your  eyes.  Very  gently,  with  the  eyes  shut,  tap  the  lids  with  your  fingers,  working  from  the  nose  outwards.  At  the  corners  of  the  eyes  use  the  rotary  movement  again.  Then  with  the  thumbs  press  hard  above  the  nose  on  each  side,  just  under  the  eyebrows.  When  you  feel  a  slight  pain  you'll  know  you  are  on  the  right  spot,  then  gently  carry  the  thumbs  underneath  the  eyebrows  and  press  again  hard  on  the  temples.   Now  with  your  whole  hand  on  your  forehead  pull  the  skin  upwards   and   with   your   two   fingers   massage   gently    right    Helen  Twelvetrees  acting  distress  in  "Her  Man."

And  there,  girls,  you  have  a  facial  that  is  a  facial!  Take  a  look  at  yourself  in  the  mirror.  Don't  you  look  fine?  But  wait  a  minute!  I'm  not  through  with  you  yet.  Remove  the  cold  cream  and  splash  ice  cold  water  on  your  face.  Don't  be  afraid  of  that  cold  water.    Take  handfuls  of  it  and  throw  it  in  your  face.   NOW  look  at  yourself  in  the  mirror.  When  your  face  can  look  so  soft  and  relaxed  and  pretty  weren't  you  a  fool  to  cry?  Weren't  you  silly  to  screw  your  face  up  into  a  million  wrinkles?  Well,  then,  keep  your  chin  up,  put  a  grin  on  your  face  and  don't  let  your  Aunt  Sylvia  catch  you  crying  again!   And  that's  what  I  used  to  tell  Helen  Twelvetrees.  She  was  a  peculiar  girl,  naturally  melancholy,  natu-  rally quiet  and  with  very  few  friends.  When  I  first  took  her  she  was  quite  thin;  but  I  knew  that  she  needed  to  exercise  for  pep.    When  I  treated  her,  she    What  trace  of  melancholy  can  be  found  in  the  Helen  Twelvetrees  of  this  picture,  taken  shortly  after  the  time  of  which  Sylvia  tells?  To  the  left  is  a  recent  glimpse  of  Helen's  latest  reason  for  happiness — her  son,  Jack  Bryan  Woody,  who  was  born  October  26, 1932    was  too  rundown  to  take  all  the  hard  whacks  I  gave  her.   And  she  used  to  yell  so  that  you  could  hear  her  all  over  the   lot.    So  I  made  her  exercise.    I  did  the  exercises  with  her  and   got  her  to  laughing  over  some  of  the  funny  ones.    And  that's   a  good  idea  for  you  girls.    It's  grand  to  do  the  exercises  with  a   group  of  friends,  when  you  can  laugh  and  have  a  fine  time.   Helen  used  to  come  into  my  studio  looking  as  if  the  weight  of   the  world  rested  on  her  shoulders.    Then  we'd  start  to  exercise   and  to  laugh  and  when  the  blood  began  flowing  through  her   veins,  and  I  made  her  do  the  [  please  turn  to  page  84  ]   55    "Six  foot  two"  of  suave,  polished  European — that  was  Paul  Lukas  when  he  arrived  a  few  years  ago.  Now  he's  Amer-  icanized —  as   the   informality  of  this  picture  may  show    THESE  days,  when  a  foreign-born  star  begins  to  cast  sheep's-eyes  toward  citizenship  papers,  cynics  smile  a  cynical  smile  and  say,  "Ah,  hah!    Wanting  to  hang  on  to  the  old  pay-check!"  Well — good  enough,  in  some  cases,  perhaps.     It  depends  on  what  goes  with  the  application — what  the  applicant  is  willing  to  put  behind  it.     That  makes  the  case  of   Paul    Lukas  il-  luminating.   One  requirement  for  naturalization  is  attesting  one's  willing-  ness to  defend  the  country  with  arms,  in  case  of  need.  Pay-  check patriots  don't  find  that  bothersome.  They  can — and  do  — say,  "Yes,  yes,"  with  full  knowledge  that  they  will  be  over  military  age,  or  will  have  a  wife,  or  some   other  legitimate  reason  for  escaping  mili-  rt         rt  i   tary  service,  should  war  come  to  the  land.  U  Y    IX.  lit  tl   56    Paul    (*   A    oes    *>•>    merican    and  HOW!    His  notion  of  being  a  proper  citizen  can  teach  many  a  native  what  true  loyalty  is    Paul  Lukas  thinks  this  requirement  means  what  it  says.  He  also  believes  that  willingness  to  serve  should  be  backed  up  by  ability  to  serve.  So  he  has  joined  the  National  Guard — stands  ready  to  go,  without  further  formality,  in  case  of  need.   Most  people  hold  that  part  of  good  citizenship  is  a  family — making  one's  contribution  to  the  future  genera-  tion. Paul  has  no  children;  but  his  plans  include  adopt-  ing one,  as  soon  as  acquisition  of  final  papers  gives  him  the  legal  right  to  do  so  on  a  basis  that  will  make  the  child  an  American  citizen.  And  the  child  must  be  American  born.    Paul  insists  upon  that.   Millions  have  wanted  to  become  American  in  order  to  escape  a  social  thralldom  holding  them  down  in  the  land  of  their  birth.  They  want  a  chance  to  rise  socially,  as  well  as  economically — and  they  believe  that  American  citizenship  will  give  that  chance.   In  his  native  Hungary,  Paul  is  an  aristocrat — belongs  to  the  upper  crust.  Change  of  citizenship  can't  help  on  that  point.  So  far  as  social  distinction  based  on  "blood"  may  go,  he  stands  to  lose,  instead  of  gain,  by  swapping  over.   So  it  seems  that  when  Paul  says  he  is  after  his  final  papers  because  he'd  rather  be  American  than  anything  else,  he  has  done  a  pretty  thorough  job  of  backing  up  his  statement  with  deeds  to  prove  it.   It  shows  up  even  plainer,  if  we  drop  in  on  the  Lukases,  husband  and  wife,  at  home,  and  hear  them  having  it  back  and  forth  on  the  subject  of  America  and  Americanism.   "You  know  how  all  well-regulated  families  have  one  sure-fire,  dependable  source  of  argument?"  Paul  questions,  in  a  sudden  aside,  after  remarking  that  "Europe  suffers  from  an  outworn  civilization."   "Sometimes  it  is  where  they  will  spend  their  vacation — or  that  clock  in  the  center  of  the  mantel— or  the  old  mother-in-law  situation — always  some  reliable  bone  of  contention  that  keeps  away  the  dull  moments.  Well,  Daisy  and  I  have  one.  Ours  is  'Europe  versus  America.'  "   We  were  seated  at  luncheon  in  their  lovely  dining-room.  .  .  .  Paul,  Daisv  Lukas  and  mvself.

They  may  not  have  a  superstition  under  the  sun  but  a  hunch  is  something  else  again.   It's  a  funny  word.  It  comes  from  hunchback,  really.  There  is  a  gambler's  superstition  that  to  touch  the  hump  of  a  hunchback  brings  good  luck.  And  so  "hunch"  has  come  to  mean  a  sort  of  subconscious  warning  —  one  that  if  heeded  is  supposed  to  bring  good  luck  or  prevent  calamity.   Among  the  picture  stars  are  many  instances  of  this  one  or  that  one  being  saved  from  physical  disaster,  even  death,  by  following  a  hunch  that  was  too  strong  to  ignore.   I  shall  never  forget  an  incident  that  happened  to  Bebe  Daniels  some  years  ago.  The  old  Montmarte  Cafe  was  at  the  height  of  its  vogue  then  and  the  few  tables  not  occupied  by  stars  and  directors  at  luncheon  time  were  eagerly  sought  by  tourists.   Bebe  and  myself  were  having  lunch  with  one  or  two  friends  there  one  day.  Suddenly,  we  became  conscious  that  a  man  across  the  room  was  staring  intently  at  our  table.  It  was  quite  usual  for  visitors  to  gape  at  the  picture  players,  but  we  sensed  something  tense  and  dramatic  in  the  man's  attitude.  It  was  not  just  the  usual  curiosity  of  an  enthusiastic  picture  fan.   As  we  commented  on  it,  he  quickly  stood  up,  walked  straight  to  Bebe,  and  bowed.   "I  hope  you  will  pardon  me,  madame,  but  I  was  so  strongly  moved  I  had  to  speak  to  you.  I  don't  know  who  you  are  nor  what  you  do,  but  within  a  short  time  you  are  going  to  be  in  great  danger.  You  are  going  to  be  asked  to  work  on  something  that  is  moving  rapidly.  Please  do  not  do  it.  It  will  be  dis-  astrous for  you."   Again  he  bowed,  and  before  Bebe  could  recover  herself  enough  to  make  re-  ply, he  was  gone.  Naturally,  we  all  thought  he  was  either  a  crank,  or  else  a  friend  had  bribed  him  to  play  a  practical  joke  on  Bebe.  Bebe  forgot  about  the  incident.   THE  following  week,  Bebe  and  James  Hall  were  doing  a  scene  in  a  Pullman  car.  In  those  days,  to  get  the  effect  of  a  fast  moving  train,  a  set  resembling  a  Pull-  man coach  was  mounted  on  a  fast  moving  truck.   In  driving  the  truck  at  great  speed  through  the  streets  of  Pasadena,  it  turned  over.  Bebe  was  pinned  under  it.  For  many  hours  they  thought  she  had  concussion  of  the  brain.  Fortu-  nately, it  was  not  quite  that  serious,  and  she  recovered  in  a  short  time.   She  still  insists    It's  amazing  to  hear  stars  tell  of  owing  careers  and  lives  to  a  queer  premonition   By  May  Allison  Quirk    that  it  was  her  strangest  experience.  Bebe  has  never  been  known  to  turn  a  deaf  ear  to  her  own  hunches  since  that  time.   Joan  Crawford  comes  pretty  near  to  being  "psychic"  herself,  I  would  say.   "While  we  were  working  on  'Rain'  at  Catalina  Island,"  she  told  me,  "we  tried  to  come  home  for  week-ends.  Some  ten  or  twelve  of  us  would  make  the  trip  in  a  small  launch  after  Satur-  day's work  was  finished.   "One  Saturday  night  I  had  my  bag  packed  and  had  started  from  the  hotel  to  the  boat,  when  suddenly  I  became  almost  ill  with  a  feeling  of  approaching  disaster.  It  was  as  definite  as  if  someone  had  walked  by  my  side  and  said,  '  You  cannot  go  home  on  that  boat  tonight.'  I  merely  told  the  members  of  the  company  that  I  had  changed  my  mind  and  then  I  returned  to  the  hotel.   "  That  night  the  motor  of  the  launch  went  dead  and  the  small  boat  battled  the  waves  all  night  before  help  arrived.  It  mac1?  a  complete  nervous  wreck  of  one  of  my  friends  who  was  on  board.    All  of  them  had  a  ghastly  experience.   "I  often  have  strong  presentiments  about  people,  too,"  she  continued.  "I  had  a  hunch  about  Constance  Bennett  long  before  we  met.  From  the  first  introduction  ours  has  been  a  warm  and  understanding  friendship."   ADOLPHE  MENJOTJ  admits  quite  frankly  that  more  than  once  his  life  has  been  saved  through  some  inner  warning.  He  resents  the  feeling  somewhat  as  it  applies  to  physical  danger,  for  Adolphe  doesn't  know  the  meaning  of  the  word  "fear."  But  it  has  happened  too  often  for  him  to  ignore  it.   One  instance  occurred  in  London  a  few  years  ago.    Adolphe  made  reservations  on  one  of  the  big  planes  for  crossing  the  English  Channel,  and  had  his  luggage  sent  to  the  airport.  Then,  abruptly,  he  had  the  queerest  misgivings.     He  was   furious  with  him-  self, but  no  matter  how  hard  he  tried  to  argue  against  it,  he  couldn't  overcome  the  feeling  of  im-  pending tragedy.   He  finally  can-  celled his  passage  for  the  plane,  feeling  resentful  and  a  little  sheepish,  and  took  the  boat  to  France.  The  plane  he  was  to  have  taken  was  wrecked  over  the  Channel.  Every  life  aboard  was  lost.    "Just  how  madly  in  love  with  me  is  this  girl?"    J    OEL  McCREA   believes  that  not  only  has  his  life  been  spared  on  several  occasions  by  a  sub-  conscious warning,  but  he  feels  that  his  hunch  about  screen  stories  has  helped  him  to  advance  his  career  to  a  large  ex-  tent. Let  him  tell  the  most  recent  in-  cident of  physical  preservation.

The  com-  bination of  cast  and  plot  is  topped  off  in  excellent  direction  by  Howard  Hawkes.  So  you  have  several  good  reasons  for  seeing  this  picture.   For  the  details  we  need  only  say  that  Joan  is  engaged  to  Bob,  and  they,  with  her  brother  (Franchot)  are  eyes  deep  in  the  war,  when  a  rich  American  (Gary)  rents  the  ancestral  home.  Cupid  smites  Joan  and  Gary.  And,  of  course,  you  can  guess  what  Gary  does  in  that  war-charged  atmosphere.  A  picture  you  won't  forget.    *    HELL  BELOW— M-G-M    AND  above  and  everywhere  else!  This  is  one  picture  which  will  hold  you  at  high  tension.   Bob  Montgomery,  junior  officer  on  a  submarine,  falls  in  love  with  the  daughter  (Madge  Evans)  of  his  commander  (Walter  Huston) ;  the  fact  that  she  is  already  married  to  a  wounded  aviator,  together  with  her  father's  strict  dis-  ciplinary code,  forms  the  background  for  the  thrills,  climaxed  by  that  epic  British  naval  feat,  the  storming  of  the  Zee-  brugge  Mole.   The  cast  is  just  as  big-calibered  as  the  guns  and  spec-  tacular effects — not  to  mention  the  sound  effects.  Eugene  Pallette  and  "  Schnozzle"  Durante  take  splendid  care  of  the  comedy,  and  "  Schnozzle's"  fight  with  the  kangaroo  is  grand.  You  will  be  lifted  clear  out  of  your  seat.   58    The    Shadow    A  Review  of  the  New  Pictures    it    GABRIEL  OVER  THE  WHITE  HOUSE— M-G-M    FOR  its  uncannily  prophetic  foreshadowing  of  the  spirit  of  President  Roosevelt's  first  month  in  office — for  putting  into  film,  where  all  may  see,  what  scores  of  millions  think  our  government  should  do — and  for  turning  its  plot  upon  a  plainly  hinted  miraculous  intervention — this  unquestionably  will  be  one  of  the  year's  most  talked-of  pictures.   To  start,  Jud  Hammond  (played  by  Walter  Huston)  be-  comes President  of  the  United  States  at  the  height  of  the  depression — and  being  a  shallow,  politically-minded  good-  fellow,  "fiddles  while  Rome  burns,"  or  answers  despairing  cries  with  high-sounding  "wave  the  flag"  phrases  that  ac-  complish nothing.  Then  a  reckless  motor  accident;  death  is  a  matter  of  hours;  and  lo!  From  the  death  bed  comes  a  new  J  ltd  Hammond,  one  who  sweeps  'politicians  aside,  wrests  dictatorial  power  from  Congress,  and  proceeds  to  tear  into  the  depression  in  a  way  that  has  the  nation  breathless.   That  gives  you  idea  enough  of  the  story — and  if,  later,  you  see  J ud  carrying  through  projects  that  (to  put  it  mildly)  are  highly  imaginative,  you  won't  mind,  because  the  message  and  spirit  still  ring  true.   Here  rather  let  it  be  said  that  Walter  Huston's  great  per-  formance is  supported  by  a  superb  cast,  with  Karen  Morley  and  Franchot  Tone  outstanding  as  his  secretaries.  By  all  means,  see  it!

And  to  heap  the  measure  to  overflowing,  he  has  opposite  him  his  ideal  counterpart  for  this  sort  of  picture — effervescent,  fast-step-  ping Alice  White.   This  promising  team  steps  into  action  almost  immediately  after  Jimmy  emerges  from  the  penitentiary,  convinced  that  the  bed-time  stories  about  what  happens  to  good  little  boys  have  some  sense  to  them.   He  goes  straight — if  you  call  snatching  pictures  of  heart-  broken people  for  a  sensational  newspaper  going  straight —  and  encounters  Alice,  a  free-and-easy  sob  sister  on  the  sheet.  She  goes  for  Jimmy  in  a  big  way — and  you  can  imagine  the  fun  when  they  get  trading  tokens  of  affection  in  the  well-  known  Cagney  style.   The  knot  is  tied  in  the  story  when  Jimmy  is  bitten  by  pangs  of  love  for  a  high-school  innocent  (Patricia  Ellis),  only  to  find  that  her  father  is  the  cop  who  sent  him  up.  The  rest  we  shall  leave  to  your  imagination — but  since  Cagney,  White  and  Company  are  in  charge,  you  won't  have  trouble  imagin-  ing that  it's  side-splitting.   For  the  rest,  we  may  say  that  the  plot,  while  knitted  with  standard  newspaper  and  "tough-guy"  ingredients,  is  refresh-  ingly handled,  and  the  dialogue  sparkles.     Don't  miss  it!    *    PICK  UP— Paramount    SYLVIA  SIDNEY  and  George  Raft  in  the  kind  of  picture  that  both  do  well.  George,  a  taxi-driver,  picks  up  Sylvia  just  after  she  has  been  released  from  prison;  love  blossoms  smoothly  in  their  informal  home  until  George  is  intrigued  by  a  debutante,  and  Sylvia's  convict  husband,  breaking  out  of  jail,  gets  after  George.   You'll  go  for  Sylvia's  efforts  to  polish  her  rough  diamond,  and  George's  efforts  to  be  the  nice  farmer  boy  at  the  society  "kiddie"  party.   There's  a  wallop,  too,  when  hubby's  efforts  bring  all  con-  cerned to  court;  the  showdown  that  results  provides  a  rousing  finish.   It's  a  picture  you  can  well  afford  to  put  on  your  entertain-  ment list.    it    THE  WORKING  MAN— Warners    NOT  one  risque  situation — not  a  naughty  word — but  we  dare  you  not  to  get  some  of  the  biggest  laughs  you've  had  so  far  this  season.   Arliss  is  superb  as  the  irascible  American  shoe  manufac-  turer, who  loves  a  good  fight,  a  good  fishing  trip — and  his  little  joke.  The  pleasantry  starts  when  he  sees  that  the  orphaned  children  of  his  erstwhile  most  powerful  competitor  are  going  to  the  dogs,  taking  their  shoe  factory  with  them.  Thereupon  he  moves  in,  using  an  assumed  name.   What  he  does  for  those  two  youngsters  (Bette  Davis  and  Theodore  Newton),  not  to  mention  the  shoe  business,  is  something  you  had  better  put  on  your  hat  and  make  for  the  nearest  theater  to  see.  Hardie  Albright,  too,  deserves  men-  tion as  Bette's  boy  friend.    A  sure-fire  cheer-up.   59    The   National   Guide   to   Motion    Pictures    (REG.  U.  S.  PAT.  OFF.)    *    THE  DEVIL'S  BROTHER—  Hal  Roach —  M-G-M    ix    THE  LITTLE   GIANT—   Warners    AT  last — a  musical  that's  a  comedy  riot,  too!  It's  that  old  light  opera  favorite,  "Fra  Diavolo,"  about  an  Italian  Robin  Hood,  with  Dennis  King  leading  in  the  melodies — and  Stan  Laurel  and  Oliver  Hardy  adding  laughs  by  the  dozen!  Made,  as  such  a  piece  should  be,  on  a  comedy  lot ;  but  its  singing  cast  will  delight  music  lovers.  Thelma  Todd  adds  an  eyeful  for  good  measure.    Take  the  whole  family.    THEY  don't  make  them  better  than  this  one.  Edward  G.  Robinson  as  "Bugs"  Ahcarn,  Chicago  beer  baron,  quits  when  Uncle  Sam  "muscles  in,"  and  tries  to  crash  high  society  which,  in  the  person  of  Helen  Vinson,  makes  a  sucker  out  of  him.  Mary  Astor  adds  charm.  Lighter  than  other  Robinson  efforts,  and  crammed  with  clever  situations  and  witty  lines.  The  rescue  by  gangsters  is  a  grand  riot.    T>    LOOKING   FORWARD-   M-G-M    pleasure  cruise-  Fox    A  SIMPLE,  not  exciting  tale  about  a  venerable  British  business  battling  through  the  depression — yet  for  sheer  artistry,  it  has  rarely  been  equaled.  Inspired  performances  by  Lewis  Stone  as  the  owner  and  Lionel  Barrymore  as  the  clerk;  cameo-perfect  support  by  Benita  Hume,  Colin  Clive,  Phillips  Holmes,  England's  new  "find,"  Elizabeth  Allan,  and  others.  If  art  can  substitute  for  romance  with  you,  don't  miss  this.    A  SOMEWHAT  sexy  little  puffball  with  good  chuckles  and  comical  situations.  Roland  Young,  jealous  of  his  wife,  Genevieve  Tobin,  gets  a  job  as  a  barber  on  shipboard  when  wine  leaves  for  a  vacation;  and  a  farce  mix-up  results,  as  he  battles  off  Genevieve's  would-be  sweeties — also  romance-  hungry  Una  O'Connor,  who  has  marked  him  for  her  own.  Ralph  Forbes  and  Minna  Gombell  help  the  fun  along.    THE   BARBARIAN   —M-G-M    THE  REBEL—   Universal    GOOD  old  romance,  with  all  the  thrills,  throbs  and  hokum  left  in.  Ramon  Novarro,  as  a  rascally  Egyptian  dragoman,  falls  in  love  with  Myrna  Loy,  who  has  come  to  Cairo  to  marry  Reginald  Denny.  Myrna  is  cool,  so  Ramon  finally  kidnaps  her  and  takes  her  to  his  desert  home,  where  she  promises  to  marry  him.  But  since  this  is  hokum,  you  may  be  sure  everything  turns  out  all  right.    Fine  for  romance-starved  souls.   GO    THIS  is  a  ioreign  costume  picture — but  don't  let  that  stop  you.  Napoleon's  men  invading  the  Tyrol;  a  medical  student  coming  home  to  find  everything  gone,  and  turning  rebel;  a  man-chase  over  the  Alps,  and  the  avalanches  hurtling  down  on  the  invading  enemy;  these  make  a  story  worth  any-  one's time.  And  never  have  we  seen  more  gorgeous  photog-  raphy.    Luis  Trenker,  Yilma  Banky  and  Yictor  Yarconi.    Saves  Yo  ur   Picture    Time    and    Money    ELMER  THE  GREAT—  First  National    trick  for  trick-  Fox    JOE  BROWN  turns  to  baseball  and  makes  Babe  Ruth  look  like  a  bush-leaguer.  That  is,  as  long  as  the  team  feeds  him  the  old  build-up.  One  cross  word  and  he  can't  hit  the  broad  side  of  an  elephant.  But  little  Patricia  Ellis  does  know  how  to  spread  the  sugar;  so  the  old  home  town  isn't  disappointed,  as  it  hangs  to  the  radios  listening  to  Joe's  doings  in  the  "world's  series."  Good  baseball  and  good  comedy.    MORE  or  less  a  sequel  for  "Chandu,"  yet  not  a  repetition;  and  it  has  the  knack  of  furnishing  temporary  shivers  with-  out nightmare  memories.  The  clever  trickery  will  interest  and  kiddies  will  want  to  see  it  twice.  Ralph  Morgan  makes  an  in-  scrutably fascinating  magician,  while  Sally  Eilers  and  Tom  Dugan  delight  in  the  buoyancy  of  their  love  interest.  If  you  like  the  weird,  you'll  enjoy  this.    BABY   FACE—   Warners    TERROR   ABOARD—   Paramount    HERE'S  real  sex  in  the  raw,  with  Barbara  Stanwyck  as  the  gold  digger  who  rises  from  man  to  man,  until  she  bids  fair  to  end  life  with  diamond  service  stripes  and  a  suitcase  full  of  bonds.  But  she  trips  up — yes,  you've  guessed  it.  She  falls  for  her  last — George  Brent,  a  bank  president  who  endows  her  with  a  Mrs.  Excellently  done,  if  you  like  the  theme — but  not  for  children,  or  impressionable  school  girls,  either.    THRILLS  on  shipboard.  Murder  on  the  high  seas.  John  Halliday  receives  a  message  on  his  private  yacht  that  im-  prisonment awaits  him;  so  he  devises  a  fantastic  plot  for  killing  all  on  board  and  escaping  to  an  island.  With  Charles  Ruggles,  Neil  Hamilton,  Shirley  Grey,  Jack  LaRue,  Verree  Teasdale  pitted  against  him.  By  the  time  it  gets  too  bloodthirsty  for  credibility,  Ruggles'  comedy  is  saving  the  show.    CENTRAL  AIRPORT—  First  National    A  BEDTIME   STORY—   Paramount    GETTING  off  to  a  slow,  dragging  start,  this  story  of  two  brothers,  both  aviators,  gradually  builds  up  to  a  strong  finish.  Dick  Barthelmess,  a  stunt  flyer,  is  in  love  with  Sally  Eilers,  a  parachute  jumper.  His  kid  brother,  Tom  Brown,  marries  Sally,  and  Dick  becomes  a  wandering  daredevil  flyer.  He  recovers  contact  just  in  time  to  save  Tom  from  a  watery  death  over  the  ocean,  and  bows  himself  out  of  the  picture.    BUT  the  story  practically  puts  M.  Chevalier  to  sleep.  His  usual  sang  froid,  joie  de  vie,  plus  what-have-you,  suffer  from  lack  of  opportunity.  But  hold  on — all  is  not  lost.  There  remains  Baby  LeRoy.  "M.  Baby"  smiles  engagingly  at  the  fast  company  with  which  he  makes  his  screen  debut,  and  puts  the  picture  neatly  in  his  pocket.    Helen  Twelvetrees  is  pretty.   [  ADDITIONAL  REVIEWS  ON  PAGE  96  ]   61    <?<?    The  Tooth  Will  Tell    vv    "Folks  won't  know  you,  Jack,  all  dressed  up  this  way,"  we  say.    "That's  nothing,"  say  you, "to  what  you're  going  to  see.  I'm  out  to  show  them  now"    YOU  know  Jack  Oakie?  Good  old  easy  come,  easy  go,  sweat-shirty  Jack?  Well,  look  what  he  did.  Just  take  one  look.   From  this  time  on,  everything  will  be  dated  from  the  time  Jack  Oakie  dressed  up.  Grew  a  mustache.  And  sprayed  with  "Maidens  Dream  of  Delight."   "Well,  well,"  Hollywood  murmured  when  Jack  first  stepped  out  with  Peggy  Hopkins  Joyce.  "Look  what  Peggy  did  to  our  little  boy.  Just  lookie.  Get  an  eyeful  of  those  clothes.  Those  buttonhole  bouquet.    Those  mustache."   But,  you  see,  what  Hollywood  doesn't  know  or  suspect  is,  that  Peggy,  with  all  due  respect  to  her  powers  of  persuasion,  had  little  or  nothing  to  do  with  it.   The  reason  is  just  this.    Jack  doesn't  want  to  be  Oakie  any  more.     He's  a  little  weary  of  hearing  them  say,  "You  know  good  old  Jack."    He's  a  little  tired  of  being  dragged  in  for  comedy  relief.    A  D  ~   little  tired  of  seeing  the  Georgie  Rafts  Uy      O  fl  V  CL   62    Jack  Oakie  gives  a  sign  by  which  we're  to  know  the  new  and  so  dressy  Mr.  Oakie    and  Cary  Grants  climbing  briskly  and  swiftly  over  Jack's  five  years  of  good,  solid  service  which  hasn't,  after  all,  gotten  him  where  he  feels  he  should  be.  Jack  has  a  terrific  "yen"  all  of  a  sudden,  to  be  a  hero.   The  Freddie  March  type,  who  wins  the  girl  in  the  final  reel.  Not  just  the  wisecrack-  ing "goof"  who  kids  along.  Monkeyshining  through  reel  after  reel,  only  to  have  some  other  fellow  walk  off  with  the  heart  throb.   He'll  lie  on  his  dressing-room  couch,  knees  up  like  a  kid,  his  head  hanging  down  over  the  side,  and  tell  about  it.  Serious  like.  Till  you  can  hardly  keep  from  weeping.   He's  slowly  but  surely  surrounding  himself  with  every  single  thing  he  thinks  he  needs  to  be  a  heroic  kind  of  guy.   For  instance,  we've  seen  that  new  Beverly  Hills  home  of  Jack's.

We  peeked  into  the  bureau  drawers.  "Look,"  his  mother  said,  "all  new  shorts.  A  dozen  of  them.  White  linen,  feel!  And  look  at  the  initials.  All  worked  by  hand.  See,  'J-O.'"   Even  the  perfume  spray.  The  good  old  "Maidens  Dream  of  Delight."  "Jack  says  it  won't  hurt  the  clothes  a  bit,"  his  mother  said,  and  sent  us  out  into  a  startled  world  smelling  exactly  like  Jack  Oakie.  And  a  lily  of  the  valley.   On  the  satin  covered  chaise  longue  lay  some  of  his  new  clothes.  "He  won't  let  me  hang  them  up,"  his  adored  mother  smiled.  "Wants  everything  where  he  can  see  it."   "Everything's  different,"  said  Jack  as  we  sat  in  his  dressing-room  some  time  after  the  visit  to  his  home.  "It  ain't  the  same  in  Hollywood,  any  more.  Gee,  every  one  used  to  be  so  palsy  walsy,  dropping  into  a  fellow's  dressing-room  and  everything."  Only  four  people  had  dropped  into  Jack's  dressing-room  in  the  last  five  minutes,  but  we  didn't  say  a  word.   "The  lot's  full  of  strangers,"  he  went  on..  "You  can't  be  free  and  informal,  the  way  you  used  to  be."   "Yoo  hoo,"  he  yelled,  in  the  next  breath,  from  his  dressing-  room  door,  at  a  little  blonde  passing.  "How  you,  honey?  Where  you  been,  darlin'?  Oh,  you  been  away,  sweet?  Well,  honeybunch,  I'll  be  seem'  you."   "Who's  that?"  Stuart  Erwin,  who  had  just  dropped  in,  in-  quired.   "  Don't  know  her  name  exactly,"  Jack  explained.    "  Met  her  at  a  partv  once.      Gee,   everything's  changed  around   here.  Things  is  stiff  and  formal.    Can't  be  yourself,  any  more.    Don't  you  think  so,  Stu?"  he  asked  Erwin.  Stu  looked  at  him  a  long  minute.   "Oakie,  you're  going  nuts  er  some-   .  f  thing,"  he  observed  and  strolled  away.

You  will  notice  that  the  hat  is  covered  with  tulle,  too.  Gardenias    make    an     attractive    bouquet.

You  can  see  what  a  smart  affair  it  is — ideal  to  wear  over  all  your  summer  evening  frocks.  Banton  has  designed  it  with  a  collarless  neckline  and  huge  bow  at  one  side.

Pleated  ruffles  of  the  chiffon  dre  used  cleverly  for  both  shoulder  and  skirt  animation.  These  ruffles  widen  at  the  shoulder  and  as  they  reach  the  hem  of  the  dress.

Now  that  he's  on  top,  he  looks  back  and  laughs  at  the  time  he  tried  so  hard  to  sell  farm  implements.  That  was  in  little  old  Ohio  where  presidents  have  also  come  from.    Warner's  next  picture  will  be  "I  Loved  You  Wednesday"    The  Little  Maid    <!<?    of   Cavalcade    Irish  to  the  core,  an  inimitable  Cockney  in  "Cavalcade" —  versatil-  ity is  her  middle  name    95    By   Reginald    Taviner    SHE  might  have  stepped  right  out  of  Kipling  to  come  over  here — and  now,  make  no  mistake,  we  can  learn  about  Hollywood  from  her.  Actually,  Una  O'Connor  stepped  right  off  the  stage  of  the  Drury  Lane  Theater,  London's  most  famous  show  house,  to  step  into  the  same  role  she  had  been  playing  there,  in  the  picture  "Cavalcade."   You  will  remember  her — you  couldn't  forget  her — as  the  little  Cockney  maid  whose  'usband  went  out  to  the  Boer  war  with  'is  marster.  It  was  she  who  was  the  mother  of  the  dancer,  s'eln  us;  who  gave  'er  'eart  to  the  marster's  son  in  the  later  bloody  slaughter.  She  made  us  'owl  wrhen  she  sniveled  into  'er  bleedin'  apron,  re-  member, while  she  was  serving  the  tea,  and  then  she  went  'igh-'at  because  'er  old  man  kept  a  pub —   And  that's  just  where  the  rub  comes  in.  Because  although  Una  O'Connor  was  the  Cockney  to  perfection,  with  a  haccent  that  would  cut  a  London  fog  and  man-  nerisms that  would  fool  Bow  bells  themselves,  she  isn't  really  a  Cockney  at  all.  She's  both  Judy  O'Grady  and  the  colonel's  lady,  which  is  the  British  idea  of  a  char-  acter actress.   As  a  matter  of  fact,  Una  O'Connor  was  born  in  Belfast,  Ireland,  of  quite  thoroughly  Irish  parents.    T_JTER  views  of  America,  after  six  months  here,  are  a  bit  *~  ^-unusual.  She  says,  for  instance,  that  Americans  are  not  in  a  hurry;  that  they  are  actually  slower  in  getting  things  done  than  the  English,  although  they  make  more  fuss  about  it.  Regarding  Hollywood  itself  she  is  im-  pressed not  so  much  with  the  movie  stars  and  the  phantasmagoria  that  goes  with  them,  but  with  the  vastness,  the  cleanliness,  and  the  beauty  of  the  place.   "Why,  everybody  in  the  shops  and  everywhere  wears  such  spotless  white  and  looks  so  spick  and  span,"  was  her  characteristic  observation.  "It  must  cost  them  a  for-  tune every  day  for  laundry  bills  alone."   Also,  used  to  London's  famous  clock,  Big  Ben,  she  is  completely  sunk  by  the  scarcity  of  clocks.   "You  scarcely  ever  see  public  clocks,"  she  wailed,  "and  hardly  anybody  carries  the  time.  It  doesn't  seem  to  matter.  And  if  you  ask  a  person  where  a  certain  street  is,  even  though  he  is  only  a  block  from  it,  he  will  tell  you  he  doesn't  know.  And  where  on  earth  do  they  hide  the  post  offices  and  the  street  names?  I  can't  imagine  how  anybody  finds  their  way  around.  As  for  house  numbers — well!  They  certainly  get  the  smallest  ones  they  can  and  keep  them  hidden."    When  so  richly  varied  a  nature  as  Una  O'Connor's  turns  to  portraying  Americans,  the  result  should  be  well  worth  seeing    But  Hollywood's  broad  lawns,  hedgeless  houses  and  gently  waving  palms,  its  endless  carpet  of  flowers  and  its  encircling  mountain  ranges,  its  garishness  and  its  beauty — these  leave  her  breathless.   "It's  paradise!"  she  breathed.     "Simply  paradise!"

And  there  are  definite  rules  for  success  in  this  important  business  as  there  are  in  other  games,"  "Kay  Francis  said  to  me.  "I   really   think   that   women   today   have   forgotten   their  femininity.    And  I  don't  mean  that  they  can't  wear  tweed  suits  or  work  as  hard  as  their  brothers,  either.     I  mean  those  mo-  ments at  home  when  wives  forget  to  be  glamorous  to  their  men.   76    "  Every  woman  has  her  little  mysteries,  even  if  it's  only  a  trick  of  clothes  or  make-  up. And  do  you  think  men  don't  notice  when  a  woman's  nose  isn't  powdered?  Or  when  the  straps  of  her  undies  are  slipping  off  her  shoulders  or  when  she  is  not  dainty  in  her  clothes?"   Husband  Kenneth  MacKenna  was  due  any  moment.  And  Kay  was  certainly  an  attractive  wife  for  him  to  come  home  to.  She  had  been  too  busy  to  have  a  shampoo  and  set  that  week.  But  her  hair  proved  the  point  of  what  she  had  been  saying.  She  had  merely  run  her  comb  through  her  permanent,  fluffed  it  up  a  little  at  the  back,  then  patted  it  down  over  the  ears.  A  little  fragrant  hair  tonic  had  made  it  lovely.   MODERN   wives,"   some   one   de-  murred, "are  usually  too  busy  to  bother  much  with  their  looks."   "  Keeping  attractive  is  really  such  an  important  part  of  a  wife's  job,"  Kay  shot  back,  "that  she  should  make  time.  Girls  going  to  business  every  day — I  see  them  early  mornings  when  I'm  on  my  way  to  the  studio — are  the  essence  of  loveliness.  They  have  perhaps  less  time  than  the  wives  who  stay  at  home.  Yet  they  know  that  looking  attractive  is  part  of  their  office  jobs  and  they  don't  neglect  this  point."   "But  suppose  one  isn't  born  good  look-  ing or  charming  or  anything,"  one  of  the  unmarried  girl  friends  lamented,  "what  then?  Don't  men  always  fall  for  a  pretty  face  and  figure  regardless  of  anything  else?"   "Of  course,  beauty  always  attracts  a  man,"  Kay  said,  "but  it's  charm  that  holds  him.  You  know,  I  believe  that  a  man  who  passes  up  a  charming  girl  just  because  she  isn't  pretty  is  cheating  him-  self, not  the  girl.  The  man  who  can  see  through  a  plain  looking  girl,  right  through  her  features  to  the  thing  behind  her  eyes  which  is  her  inner  charm,  is  the  man  who  would  make  a  better  husband.  It's  a  sort  of  barometer  for  measuring  a  man's  emotional  depth,  too,  don't  you  see?"   "Honestly,  now,"  some  one  asked,  "do  you  think  a  modern  1933  wife  would  have  taken  on  so  seriously  about  her  husband's  affair  as  you  did  over  Ronnie  Colman's  philandering  in  'Cynara'?"

At  a  tea  in  New  York  the  day  she  sailed  for  a  European  vacation,  I  had  the  pleasure  of  once  more  meeting  and  observing  this  charming  star.   Norma  is  an  inspiring  lesson  in  loveliness,  grace  and  poise.  Even  by  watching  her,  one  feels  inspired  to  be  lovely  at  any  cost.  Perhaps  it  is  the  cordial  ease  with  which  she  meets  and  greets  people.  Perhaps  it  is  because  she  is  so  natural  and  so  perfect  to  look  at.  Her  brown  hair  is  brushed  back  to  show  a  poetic  widow's  peak.  Any  girl,  by  the  way,  who  does  not  capitalize  on  a  natural  widow's  peak  is  sacrific-  ing a  strong  point  in  favor  of  beauty.  Norma's  eye  make-up  is  the  most  subtle  and  captivating  I  have  ever  seen.  Her  brows  are  the  color  of  her  hair,  rather  straight  and  natural  in  shape.  In  place  of  the  usual  eye  shadow  her  lids  have  a  faint  pink  glow — the  very  subtle  use  of  rouge  I  suspect.  Her  lashes,  natural  by  the  way,  seem  to  sweep  outward  along  the  lid-line  so  that  the  eye  is  long  rather  than  round.   There  is  a  faint  radiance  of  color  over  her  upper  cheeks  and  temples.  This  is  done  so  gently  and  evenly  that  you  would  never  sus-  pect rouge.  Her  lip  rouge,  used  very  lightly,  matches  the  cheek  tone  and  the  upper  lips  are  enlarged  just  the  tiniest  bit.   Norma's  voice  is  low,  informal  and  pleasant.  Here  is  a  tip  for  every  girl.  Watch  your  voice.  Try  to  keep  it  pleasant.  Try  to  eliminate  too  high  or  raucous  notes — if  you  have  them.   The  development  of  poise  does  not ,  of  course,  come  overnight.  It  takes  time  and  concentra-  tion. One  thing  to  remember  is — take  your  time.  Do  not  hurry  needlessly.  Try  to  be  composed.    Composure  comes  from  within  you.   80    Learn  to  have  your  mind  at  rest  and  a  natural  ease  will  follow.   A  STARTLING,  new  eye  make-up  trick  ■*  *•  conies  from  Hollywood.  Some  stars  have  had  their  lower  eyelashes  entirely  removed,  while  a  deep  fringe  of  artificial  lashes  is  placed  over  the  upper  ones.  This  gives  a  dramatic,  poetic  expression  to  the  eyes,  but  I  do  not  advise  it  for  our  readers.  It  is  -entirely  too  unnatural  and  bizarre.   "V\  THAT  do  you  think  of  those  new  bandeaux  *^  that  hold  the  hair  straight  back  from  your  forehead  in  true  Alice-in-\Yonderland  fashion?

They  should  be  grand  for  summer  when  hair  off  the  face  makes  you  both  look  and  feel  ever  so  much  cooler.  I'll  try  to  have  one  in  picture  for  you  next  month.   SYLVIA  SIDNEY,  who  bobbed  her  long  hair  about  this  time  last  year,  has  let  it  grow  again.  She  is  now  wearing  it  parted  on  the  side,  loosely  water-waved  with  ends  braided  and  wound  in  a  low  knot  at  the  nape  of  her  neck,  very  Gibson  girl.   MIRIAM  HOPKINS  has  also  started  some-  thing new  in  hair — for  her.  Those  unruly  curls  that  were  virtually  her  trade-mark  are  now  brushed  straight  back  from  her  forehead  and  ears.  But  her  hair  is  so  curly  that  the  short  hairs  escape  and  give  Miriam  a  halo  effect  about  her  face.   DENIS  PHILLIPS,  hair  stylist  for  Fox,  says  that  most  lack  of  chic  in  the  modern  coiffure  is  caused  by  too  thick  hair.  If  you  want  to  be  cool  and  smart  for  summer,  have  your  hair  thinning  done  at  once.  Thin  hair,  especially  at  the  ends,  is  much  easier  to  arrange  and  manage.  This,  I  know,  is  a  far  cry  from  a  few  years  ago  when  thick  hair  was  then  con-  sidered a  thing  of  beauty.  The  trick  today  is  to  have  just  enough  to  do  something  smart  with — no  more.   HERE'S  another  bit  that  ought  to  take  your  breath  away!

And  that's  a  record  for  a  high  school  miss  who  is  just  beginning  her  career.  She  was  seventeen  years  old  last  August.   Up  until  the  Tournament  of  Roses  parade  a  few  months  ago,  Jean  had  no  thought  of  a  career.  In  the  parade  she  helped  decorate  one  of  the  floats  by  wearing  a  white  bathing  suit.  Studio  officials  saw  her  picture  in  the  paper  and  lost  no  time  in  getting  her  name  and  address.   She  was  given  a  screen  test,  which  resulted  in  her  playing  a  part  in  "Divorce  in  the  Family."  Since  then  she  has  been  in  "Rasp-  utin and  the  Empress,"  "The  Secret  of  Mad-  ame Blanche"  and  "Gabriel  Over  the  White  House."   Jean  was  born  in  Deer  Lodge,  Mont.  When  a  small  child,  her  family  moved  to  Pasadena,  Calif.,  where  she  was  reared  and  educated.  At  school  she  was  very  athletic.  She  loves  swimming,  dancing,  tennis,  riding  and  field  hockey.  Now  that  her  days  are  taken  up  with  picture  work,  she  has  to  attend  night  school.  Her  hobby  is  collecting  art  sketches  and  photography.  She  does  a  bit  of  sketching  her-  self. Has  twice  won  prizes  for  her  poster  work.  Her  real  name  is  Mae  Green,  but  M-G-M  changed  it  when  they  gave  her  a  contract.    82    From  high  school  to  movie  fame,  that's  Jean  Parker's  pace.  Her  sweet  face  and  fine  acting,  in  minor  roles,  attracted  the  public's  eye  and  caused  many  to  write,  asking  this  and  that  about  her    Dorothy  Miller,  Cambria  Co.,  Pexxa. —  Dot,  Eddie  Cantor  was  born  on  January  31,  1892.  That  makes  him — oh,  you  figure  it  out.  He  has  five  daughters.  Has  absolutely  no  faith  in  the  slogan  "If  you  want  a  boy,  ring  Western  Union."  His  girls  are  named,  Marjorie,  Natalie,  Edna,  Marilyn  and  Janet;  aged,  eighteen,  sixteen,  fourteen,  eleven  and  five  respectively.   S.  R.,  Dexter,  New  Mexico.— Beggin'  your  parden  in  advance,  m'am,  but  Gloria  Stuart  was  the  blonde  Wampas  star  who  traveled  from  California  to  New  York  via  air  mail.  It  cost  the  little  lady  just  24,500  one-  cent  stamps.  When  they  put  her  on  the  scales  they  decided  that  was  her  weight's  worth  in  Uncle  Sam's  postage.   Axita  Gilmax,  Btjcksport,  Me. — Anita,  where  have  you  been  each  time  I  have  given  out  Garj'  Cooper's  history?  Not  paying  attention,  eh?  Gary  first  saw  light  in  Helena,  Mont.,  on  May  7,  1901,  and  was  christened  Frank  J.  Cooper.  He  is  6  feet.  2  inches  tall;  weighs  180  pounds  and  has  black  hair  and  blue  eyes.  Prior  to  his  debut  in  pictures  in  1926,  he  was  a  cartoonist.  His  latest  pictures  are  "A  Farewell  to  Arms,"  and  "Today  We  Live."  If  Gary  is  your  favorite,  don't  miss  either  of  these  fine  pictures.    Roger  M.,  Toroxto,  Oxt.,  Cax— I  am  very  sorry,  Roger,  but  I  cannot  give  out  the  home  addresses  of  the  stars.  If  you  will  look  further  back  in  this  issue  you  will  find  a  list  of  stars  who  are  under  contract,  and  their  studio  addresses.   Melba  Sartix,  Newport  News,  Va. — The  picture  in  which  Clark  Gable  and  Joan  Craw-  ford appeared  as  Salvationists  was  "Laughing  Sinners,"  taken  from  the  play  "Torch  Song."  Clark  was  32  years  old  on  February  1st,  last.   Helex  Freitog,  Baltimore,  Md. — Y'ou're  not  the  only  girl  who  has  fallen  hard  for  Nils  Asther.  He  surely  made  a  hit  with  his  portrayal  of  Yen  in  "The  Bitter  Tea  of  General  Yfen."  Here's  the  low-down  on  him.  Born  in  Malmo,  Sweden,  on  January  17,  1902.  He  is  6  feet  x/i  inch  tall;  weighs  170  pounds  and  has  brown  hair  and  hazel  eyes.  Appeared  on  the  stage  in  Sweden  before  entering  pictures  there  in  1918.  He  came  to  America  to  make  pictures  in  1927.  It  was  in  "Topsy  and  Eva,"  his  first  American  picture,  that  he  met  Vivian  Duncan,  of  the  famous  Duncan  Sisters,  whom  he  later  married.  Their  wedded  bliss  ended  in  the  divorce  courts  in  November,  1932.   Mrs.  Charles  White,  Coxcordville,  Pexxa. — Harpo  Marx  is  not  a  mute.  He  just  assumes  that  attitude  when  appearing  on  the  stage  and  screen.  And,  of  course,  that's  only  a  red  wig  that  sits  atop  his  head.  Who  wins  the  argument?   Axderson,  Melissa,  Tex. — And  another  little  peace  treaty  needs  signing.  Bing  Crosby  is  not  old  or  middle  aged,  he  is  only  29.  Tacoma,  Wash.,  takes  a  bow  as  his  home-  town.  He  is  5  feet.  9  inches  tall;  and  weighs  165  pounds.  Has  light  brown  hair  and  blue  eyes.  His  first  screen  appearance  was  as  one  of  the  Rhythm  boys  in  Paul  Whiteman's  orchestra  in  "King  of  Jazz."   Harlow  O'Coxxor,  Seattle,  Wash. —  Don't  tell  me  you  can't  tell  the  Barrymore  brothers  apart!  It  was  Lionel  whom  you  saw  in    "Washington    Masquerade."   Edith  Schooxmaker,  Axsoxia,  Coxx. — In  "The  Vagabond  King"  the  role  of  Louis  XI  was  played  by  O.  P.  Heggie.  Lillian  Roth  was  the  girl  in  the  tavern.  Dennis  King's  back  in  pictures  again.  This  time  you  will  see  him  in  "The   Devil's   Brother."   Marion,  New  York  City,  N.  Y. — Am  I  amazed?  Why,  I  thought  everyone  knew  all  about  Warner  Baxter.  He's  been  in  pictures  so  long.  Pay  attention,  now!  Warner  was  born  in  Columbus,  Ohio,  on  March  27,  1891.  He  is  5  feet,  11  inches  tall;  weighs  165  pounds  and  has  brown  hair  and  brown  eyes.  For  twelve  years  he  played  in  stock,  vaudeville  and  New  Y/ork  productions.  Entered  pictures  in  1921.  Has  been  married  to  Winifred  Bryson,  a  non-professional,  since  1917.  Warner's  favorite  sports  are  swimming,  tennis  and  hunting.  He  plays  the  banjo  and  guitar.  His  latest  picture  is  "42nd  Street."   Phyllis  Graham,  West  Ly-nn,  Mass. —  Tom  Brown  was  born  in  New  York  City  just  20  years  ago.  He  is  5  feet,  10  inches  tall,  weighs  150  pounds  and  has  brown  hair  and  blue  eyes.  Richard  Cromwell,  who  is  a  native  of  Los  Angeles,  is  the  same  height  as  Tom,  weighs  two  pounds  less  and  is  two  years  older.  Dorothy  Wilson  is  5  feet,  \]S2  inches  tall,  and  Joan  Blondell  is  2:4  inches  taller.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  June,  1933    ??    I'm  Not  Broke  Says  Gloria    ii    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PACK  36  ]   embarrassed  by  facts  and  figures,  and  always  has  been.   "But  here's  why  that  bankrupt  story  was  broadcast."  she  confided.  "Right  on  top  of  a  heap  of  bills  and  judgments  merchants  tried  to  pile  on  me  during  my  absence  from  Holly-  wood, I  suddenly  changed  my  plans  about  sail-  ing. I  had  said  I  did  not  owe  those  bills  and  would  not  pay  for  anything  I  hadn't  ordered  from  portraits  to  furniture  which  was  forced  on  me  for  approval.   I  NEVER  did  want  the  stuff  and  tried  hard  to  send  it  back.  In  my  haste  from  Holly-  wood when  I  sailed  for  Europe  I  left  word  with  my  attorney  to  take  care  of  all  these  matters.  He  told  those  people  what  I'd  said,  but  they  never  called  for  half  of  the  interior  decorations  they  had  insisted  upon  leaving  at  my  home.  Holly-  wood stars  are  victimized  every  day  this  way  because  salesmen  take  advantage  of  their  reputations,  realizing  that  most  picture  people  dislike  intensely  these  odious  arguments.   "So,  directly  following  my  denial  of  these  bills,  I  changed  my  sailing  plans  because  of  last  minute  change  of  arrangements  about  my  children  and  their  Swiss  nurse.  It  was  merely  coincidental  and  some  one  hooked  the  two  ideas  together  and  broadcast  the  word  that  Gloria  Swanson  couldn't  sail  because  she  was  broke.  .  .  .   "I'm  not  broke,"  Gloria  said  seriously.  "How  could  I  be  .  .  .  haven't  I  an  adorable-  new  baby  .  .  .  two  other  charming  children.  And  then,  haven't  I  my  very  grand  husband?"    Now  it's  Betty  Furness,  and  not  "Betty  Co-Ed"  of  song  fame  who  stepped  out  of  boarding  school  to  thrill  you  via  RKO-Radio  pictures.  Though  it  might  be  the  same  Betty,  she's  that  collegiate  and  popular  with  the  younger  set  out  Hollywood  way.

She  had  pep  and  a  sparkle  in  her  eye.   Then  she  got  to  working  very  hard  and  I  didn't  see  her  for  some  time.  She  began  to  get  fat  and  it  was  Alice  White — one  of  her  best  friends — who  gave  her  a  good  lecture  and  said,  "You'd  better  get  Sylvia  over  here  quick."   Helen  sent  for  me  and  I  found  she  was  very  much  in  love  with  the  man  she  later  married.  Her  mental  state  was  much  better.  She  cer-  tainly didn't  tell  me  any  sob  stories  this  time;  but  she  needed  to  take  off  several  pounds  around  her  hips.  I  took  one  look  at  her  and  said,  "Get  up  the  stairs,  you  and  I  are  going  to  work  on  those  hips."   "But  Sylvia,"  she  pleaded,  "I've  got  a  date.  Let's  not  start  tonight."   "We  start  right  now,"  I  said.  "You'll  have  time  for  dates  when  those  pounds  are  off."   I  GAVE  her  the  exercise  I've  described  several  times  before — the  one  where  you  sit  down  and  hitch  yourself  across  the  floor,  as  if  you  were  walking  in  a  sitting  position — but  I  made  her  keep  her  toes  pointed  and  straight  out  in  front,  for  that  reduces  the  ankles  at  the  same  time.  After  she  married  Mr.  Woody,  he  used  to  beg  me  to  let  Helen  off  the  exercises.  But  I  made  her  stick  to  it  until  she  had  lost  the  surplus  weight.    [  CONTINUED  EROM  PAGE  55  ]   And  now  for  Helen's  diet.  Since  the  only  places  she  needed  to  lose  were  her  hips  and  legs,  I  didn't  give  her  a  very  strenuous  diet.  This  is  what  I  call  an  in-between  diet.  You  won't  put  on  any  weight  while  you're  taking  it — you  may  even  lose  slightly — but  you'll  certainly  have  everything  you  need — all  the  minerals  for  keeping  up  strength.  It  is  also  a  marvelous  diet  for  nervous  people  who  don't  want  to  put  on  weight.   For  breakfast  I  gave  Helen  grapefruit  or  orange  juice,  two  slices  of  whole  wheat  toast  with  a  little  butter  and  honey,  a  coddled  egg  and  coffee.   For  luncheon — two  kinds  of  vegetables  (only  one  starchy  vegetable)  or  one  vegetable  and  a  baked  potato,  fruit  salad,  iced  tea  with  lemon  and  a  lump  of  sugar.   Then  for  dinner  a  clear  soup,  roast  or  some-  thing from  the  grill,  two  vegetables,  lettuce  and  tomato  salad  (I'm  a  fanatic  about  salads  and  believe  that  they  should  be  eaten  right  with  the  meat  course)  with  French  dressing  that  has  plenty  of  lemon  juice  in  it.  Skin  of  a  baked  potato  and  for  dessert,  sherbet  or  small  cup  custard  with  a  teaspoon  of  caramel  sauce,  or  fruit  jello  and  a  tablespoon  of  thin  cream;  also  a  small  slice  of  angel  food  cake  and  demi  tasse.  Glass  of  grapefruit  juice  before  going  to  bed.    Now  there  you  have  a  sensible  and  balanced  diet  and  one  that  is  marvelous  for  the  nerves.   It  is  wonderful  to  see  Helen  so  happy  now.  She  had  always  wanted  a  son  and  now  she  has  one  of  the  most  beautiful  babies  I  have  ever  seen.  Of  course,  she  had  to  give  up  her  studio  work  before  the  baby  came  and  for  several  months  afterwards.  Lots  of  folks  wondered  if  she  would  ever  continue  her  career.  I  knew  she  would  because  I  knew  how  am-  bitious she  was  and  when  I  saw  how  she  had  overcome  her  melancholia  I  knew  she  had  the  stuff.  She  has  a  nice  contract  with  Paramount  now  and  more  power  to  her.   A  LL  during  the  time  when  she  was  feeling  •*  *■  so  low  here's  what  I  used  to  tell  her:  "Adopt  this  motto — God's  gift  to  humanity  is  a  sense  of  humor.  I  can  grin  anything  off.  So  can  you.  There's  a  funny  side  to  everything  that  happens.     Look  at  that  side."   That's  what  I  used  to  tell  Helen — or  rather  I  used  to  scream  it  at  her,  for  I've  got  a  voice  that  can  be  heard — and  that's  what  I'm  telling  all  you  girls  who  get  blue  and  sad  and  de-  pressed. Give  yourself  a  grand  facial,  put  on  a  nice  make-up,  get  out  your  best  clothes  and  walk  along  the  street  with  your  shoulders  held  up  and  your  head  high.  Crying  never  gets  you  anything — except  wrinkles!    Answers  by  Sylvia    REDUCING  AND  GAINING   Dear  Sylvia:   I  read  your  article  in  Photoplay  on  how  to  gain  and  I  weighed  only  about  ninety  pounds.  The  first  month  I  gained  fifteen  pounds  and  I'm  grateful  to  you  because  I  have  never  been  able  to  gain  before.  But  I  still  want  to  put  on  more  weight.  What  would  you  suggest?  M.  L.,  Wichita,  Kan.   Besides  the  regular  gaining  diet  drink  an  ex-  tra quart  of  milk  a  day.  But  don't  gulp  it  down;  drink  it  slowly.  That  will  put  fat  on  your  bones.    Glad  I  helped  you.   Dear  Sylvia:   Should  reducing  exercises  be  taken  at  night  or  morning?   B.  L.  D.,  Houston,  Texas   Morning  is  the  best  time.  That's  when  you're  fresh  and  full  of  pep  after  a  good  sleep  and  then  you  can  work  darned  hard  to  smash  off  that  fat.  But  if  your  work  makes  it  impossible  for  you  to  take  the  exercises  in  the  morning — if  you  have  to  get  up  very  early  and  rush  through  the  exercises — then  I'd  rather  you'd  take  them  at  night.  Don't  slight  your  exercises.  Give  them  all  the  time  you  can — and  then  watch  those  old  scale?.  Will  you  be  thrilled  at  the  way  the  pounds  fall  off!   Dear  Sylvia :   This  letter  isn't  to  ask  you  a  single  question.  I  just  want  to  tell  you  how  grateful  I  am  for  what  you  have  done  for  me.  I  weighed  160  pounds  and  now  I  weigh  130,  which  is  just  about  right,  I  think.  And  it's  all  because  of  you.    Thanks  so  much.   Mrs.  H.  H.  J.,  Phoenix,  Ariz.   Well,  bless  your  heart!  Letters  like  yours  give  Aunt  Sylvia  a  thrill,  and  I'll  bet  your  husband  is  happy,  too.   84    TROUBLES,  bothers,  worries—  what  a  joy  it  is,  girls,  to  be  able  to  help!

If  you  want  help,  simply  write  Sylvia,  care  of  PHOTOPLAY  Magazine,  221  West  57th  Street,  New  York  City,  enclosing  a  stamped,  self-addressed  envelope-  No  obligation — glad  I  can  be  of  assistance.   SYLVIA    WHAT  IS  CORRECT  WEIGHT?   Dear  Madame  Sylvia:   I  am  five  feet,  four  inches  tall  and  twenty-  five  years  old.     What  should  my  weight  be?  B.  K.,  Lexington,  Ky.   I  wish  I  could  get  you  girls  out  of  the  habit  of  asking  me  that  question.  That  business  about  "you  should  weigh  just  a  certain  amount  for  your  height  and  age"  is  nonsense.  Stop  going  by  silly  charts.  Use  your  common  sense  and  the  brains  the  Lord  gave  you.  Think  for  a  minute  and  remember  that  some  people  have  large  bones  and  some  small.  How  can  general  rules  be  made?  You  should  weigh  what  your  mirror  tells  you  to  weigh.  Reduce  or  gain  until  you  look  as  you  want  to  look  and  until  you  feel  right.   HELP  FOR  A  FAT  FACE   My  dear  Sylvia:   My  face  is  very  fat.    How  can  I  reduce  it?  P.  M.  N.,  Seattle,  Wash.   I'll  bet  that  you're  fat  all  over.  Am  I  right?  If  that's  true  then  go  on  my  reducing  diet  and  take  the  right  exercises.  I  never  saw  a   thin   person   with  a   "very  fat"   face  yet.    But  you  can  reduce  your  face  by  massage,  somewhat.  And  you  can  certainly  take  off  a  double  chin.  In  this  month's  article,  about  Helen  Twelvetrees,  I  give  a  grand  and  com-  plete facial.     Try  it.   WHY  TOMATO  JUICE?   Dear  Sylvia:   I  notice  that  in  almost  all  your  diets  you  recommend  tomato  juice.  What  good  does  it  do?   R.  C,  Dodge  City,  Kansas   I  could  write  a  couple  of  pages  about  the  benefits  of  tomato  juice,  but  I'll  bet  if  I  tell  you  just  one  thing,  you'll  go  on  a  tomato  juice  spree.  Both  tomato  juice  and  fresh  tomatoes  are  marvelous  skin  beautifiers.  They  will  make  your  complexion  so  nice  that  you  won't  know  yourself  in  a  couple  of  weeks.  There!  Are  you  satisfied?  Besides,  tomato  juice  is  extremely  healthful  and  gives  you  pep.   LINES  ABOUT  THE  MOUTH   Dear  Sylvia:   There  are  a  lot  of  little  lines  around  my  mouth.  I  know  the  reason  is  because  I  make  faces  when  I  talk  and  use  my  mouth  in  an  ugly  way,  but  I  wish  you  could  tell  me  what  to  do.   M.  S.,  Colorado  Springs,  Colo.   You've  already  answered  yourself.  You  know  the  reason  for  the  lines — so  stop  making  faces.  Think  that's  easier  said  than  done,  don't  you?  I  know  it's  hard,  but  you  can  do  anything  if  you  try.  Stand  in  front  of  the  mirror  and  practise  talking  so  that  you  don't  use  your  mouth  in  an  ugly  way.  Then  get  a  friend  who  is  with  you  a  lot  to  help  you.  Make  that  friend  tell  you  every  time  you  start  making  faces.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  June,  1933    Just  "Life  And  Love"   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  76  ]    said.  "But  they  are  in  the  minority.  There  are  thousands  of  women  all  over  this  country  who  could  never  have  brought  themselves  to  live  with  husbands  again  after  they'd  found  out  an  infidelity.  As  in  Pittsficld,  Massachusetts,  where  I  once  lived.  Women  in  that  town,  and  it's  typical  of  other  towns,  would  have  felt  the  blow  to  their  pride  too  severely  to  make  up  after  a  public  scandal  such  as  followed  the  husband's  affair  in  'Cynara.'   "I  think  that's  true  of  so  many  divorces.  It's  pride  that  goads  women  on  to  an  unforgiv-  ing attitude.  They  simply  can't  believe  it  and  they  can't  walk  out  of  the  house  and  know  the  neighbors  are  whispering."   WE  thought  of  the  tragedies  for  which  neighbors  are  sometimes  responsible;  women  who,  quite  content  to  overlook  their  own  husbands'  faults,  goad  other  women  on  to  the  divorce  court.   And,  usually,  great  mountains  are  built  of  molehill  troubles.  Like  the  young  married  woman  who  thought  she  was  being  terribly  snubbed  because  her  husband  buried  himself  in  the  newspaper  at  breakfast.  Or  the  wife  whose  day  was  made  miserable  because  friend  hus-  band, rushing  off  to  make  the  8:10  train  for  the  office,  forgot  to  kiss  her  a  fond  goodbye.   "  It's  never  really  the  big  things  which  wreck  marriage,"  asserted  Kay.  "It's  the  little  things  — petty  arguments,  personal  habits,  perhaps.   "Women  have  gone  through  tragic  financial  disasters  with  husbands  today  and  they  are  happily  and  busily  rebuilding  their  lives.  Even  the  mercenary  wife  has  withstood  this  sort  of  blow.  But  let  the  same  husband  hurt  her  pride  or  get  on  her  nerves,  and  more  domestic  damage  can  be  done  than  a  dozen  bank  failures  can  cause."   "Then  you  think  a  woman  can  plan  her  life  for  happiness?  "  one  woman  asked  Kay.  "That  no  matter  what  big,  shocking  blow  comes  to  her  marriage,  she  still  can  go  on?  "   "I  see  it  this  way,"  Kay  answered.  "Unless  a  marriage  is  just  all  wrong  from  the  beginning;  unless  two  people  are  hopelessly  mismated,  I  do  think  a  woman  can  plan  her  happiness.  True,  she  may  lose  the  love  of  her  husband,  but  she  can  make  up  for  some  of  that  in  other  interests  such  as  children,  or  work,  or  her  home  or  something  she  can  be  terribly  interested  in.  It  isn't  necessary  to  dash  into  the  divorce  court  and  come  out  with  a  decree  which  eventually  may  tear  her  life  to  pieces.   "And  don't  think  I  believe  marriage  is  a  one-  sided game,"  Kay  added.   "There  are  little  courtesies  which  a  man  con-  tributes to  keep  the  glamour  in  marriage.  The  man  who  forgets  to  arise  when  his  wife  meets  him,  or  to  draw  out  her  chair  at  the  table  or  to  hold  her  wrap  .  .  .  that  man  is  forgetting  his  glamour.  For,  you  see,  as  I  said  before,  it's  the  little  things  which  put  beauty  into  marriage.   "/^\F  course,  I  don't  mean  that  men  ought  to  ^'go  around  drawing  out  .chairs  for  their  wives  and  expecting  to  build  marital  happiness  on  anything  so  slender.  What  I  mean  is  that,  granted  two  people  are  well  mated,  the  loveli-  ness of  that  marriage  relationship  need  never  become  tarnished  if  each  one  remembers  that  the  beauty  of  love  is  an  illusion.  Each  must  work  to  preserve  that  intangible  thing,  and  it  is  the  little  courtesies,  the  little  exchanges  which  grow  into  every  marriage,  which  are  stronger  than  tangible  bonds.  They  vary  with  the  individual,  of  course.   "Only  when  this  fragile  sense  of  reciproca-  tion has  fled  it  seems  do  we  realize  what  had  been  given  us — to  preserve  or  to  destroy.  Illu-  sion is  enjoyed  by  the  man  as  by  the  woman.  Both  must  strive  to  keep  a  little  glamour  and  they  will  run  less  risk  of  becoming  uninteresting  to  each  other  as  years  go  on."

'"   '""THREE  of  our  "big  names"  left  almost  simultaneously  for  Europe.   Novarro,  Chevalier  and  Arliss.   Chevalier  expects  to  be  gone  only  five  or  six  weeks.    It's  purely  business,  he  says.   Arliss  and  Mrs.  Arliss,  to  the  contrary,  are  going  for  pleasure  and  expect  to  stay  a  number  of  months.  They  will  spend  most  of  their  time  in  England,  of  course.  Novarro  is  com-  bining the  two — the  business  of  making  his  first  appearance  on  the  concert  stage,  which  will  be  the  dream  of  a  lifetime  realized.   TTIERE  seems  to  be  something  terribly  futile  in  Ann  Dvorak's  actions  of  the  past  nine  months.  Discontented  at  the  comparatively  small  salary  she  was  getting  from  Warners-  First  National,  she  left  Hollywood  and  went  to  Europe  with  her  husband,  Leslie  Fenton.   And  not  only  did  she  go  back  on  the  payroll  at  her  former  salary,  but  she  found  that  cut  in  half  by  the  eight-weeks'  general  pay  slash.   During  the  nine  months  abroad,  Fenton  worked  in  one  picture,  and  that  in  Germany.

CAROLE  LOMBARD  had  the  cleverest  ^^scheme  of  anyone  in  Hollywood  during  the  bank  holiday.  Carole  simply  gathered  up  a  lot  of  stage  money  that  had  been  used  in  a  recent  picture  and  signing  it,  handed  it  out  as  her  own  personal  script.

So  El  dashed  up  to  the  public  telephone  booths  on  the  Fox  lot  and  took  charge.  When  anyone  came  along  to  use  the  phone,  El  simply  invited  them  over  to  his  dressing-room,  had  them  charge  the  call  to  his  own  private  phone  and  collected  the  price  of  the  call  in  cash.   And  by  "Yumpin'  Yimminy''  it  wasn't  such  a  bad  idea,  for  in  four  hours  El  was  flounting  $4.25  in  the  faces  of  other  stony  broke  actors.

A/TAUREEN  O'SULLIVAN,  that  little  Irish  star,  tells  the  funniest  story  on  herself.  Maureen  asked  Elizabeth  Allan,  new  English  star,  how  she  liked  Hollywood.   "Love  it,"  Elizabeth  said,  "except  I  have  a  noisy  neighbor  who  keeps  the  radio  going  all  the  time  so  I  can't  sleep."   The  next  morning,  Maureen  stepped'out  her  front  door  just  in  time  to  see  Elizabeth  slip  out  the  door  right  next.

He  was  expected  to  return  here  from  England  to  do  a  picture  for  Paramount.   And  almost  at  the  last  moment  he  cabled  he  could  not  come  because  he  would  rather  remain  in  England  with  Mrs.  Marshall.   Because,  you  see,  they  were  expecting  a  baby  and  he  did  not  like  to  come  away.  But,  all  three  of  them  will  get  here,  he  promised,  as  soon  as  the  baby  is  old  enough  to  travel.   CMASH,  crash,  goes  the  glass!

Then  comes  "The  Kiss  Before  the  Mirror,"    Can  Hollywood  "Take  It"?    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  39    Past  extravagances  have  to  be  paid  in  cur-  rent economies — and  that  is  the  realization  which  Hollywood  is  just  putting  into  effect.  Hollywood  is  cleaning  house,  and  with  a  venge-  ance.   When  the  crisis  first  developed  Hollywood  put  on  its  most  debonair  air  and  decided  to  brazen  things  out  with  a  bold  front.  It  plunged  into  a  period  of  even  more  intensive  production  — the  way  to  make  the  additional  millions  needed,  it  reasoned,  was  to  bring  them  in  at  the  box-office  with  better  films.  But  the  box-  offices  throughout  the  nation  also  dried  up  because  of  the  scarcity  of  money  elsewhere,  and  so  Hollywood  found  itself  in  a  worse  fix  than  ever.   '"THEN  Hollywood  abruptly  about-faced  and  *■  applied  the  present  heroic  remedy.   The  success  of  that  remedy,  it  was  realized  from  the  first,  depended  upon  the  complete  co-  operation of  the  entire  industry.  All  must  put  their  shoulders  to  the  wheel  for  the  common  good.   Producers  meetings  were  called,  and  drastic  plans  rushed  through.  Mistakes  may  have  been  made  here,  but  it  was  necessary  to  do  something  to  reduce  the  staggering  expendi-  ture, and  to  do  it  quickly.   The  crisis  was  such  that  if  every  person  in  the  whole  business  did  not  aid,  the  studios  themselves  must  inevitably  close.   Too  long  salaries  had  been  soaring.  Too  long  waste  and  extravagance  had  run  rampant.  Too  long  there  had  been  an  excess  of  personnel,    paid  an  excess  in  wages.  Too  long  incom-  petent executives,  related  to  this  producer  or  that  studio  official,  had  drawn  fantastic  sums  for  using  their  feet  to  dust  expensive  desks.   The  bombshell  broke  without  warning  upon  the  whole  industry.   Within  twenty-four  hours  it  was  decided  that  the  only  way  to  keep  the  studios  open  was  for  every  person  concerned  to  work  at  half  salary  for  eight  weeks.   This  included  everybody  from  stars  to  stenographers,  and  would  give  the  studios  a  chance  to  breathe.   These  sweeping  remedies  presented  no  less  drastic  individual  problems.  But  these  were  forgotten  in  the  hope  of  saving  the  whole.  Afterwards  revisions  were  made,  exempting  the  smaller  wage-earners;  but  the  point  is  that  within  twenty-four  hours  of  the  call,  Holly-  wood had  rallied  as  one  man.   There  were  negligible  exceptions,  of  course.  But  the  industry  as  a  whole  responded  nobly.  Overnight,  the  staggering  overhead  of  the  whole  business  was  cut  in  half.   T_TOLLYWOOD  believes  that  the  studios  are  *■  -*-all  rushing  production  during  the  eight  weeks  period  to  finish  current  programs  at  the  lowest  possible  cost,  and  will  then  shut  down  to  reorganize.  One  studio,  which  had  announced  its  periodical  shut  down  prior  to  the  cut,  has  extended  its  production  period  to  cover  this  time.  Reorganization  is  recognized  as  inevit-  able, with  possible  hardships  between;  but  Hollywood  as  a  whole  is  convinced  that  follow-    with  Frank  Morgan  breaking  through  looking-  glasses.   Now  we  get  the  big  drinking  scene  in  "Re-  union in  Vienna,"  in  which  John  Barrymore,  Diana  Wynyard  and  all  the  cast  drink  a  toast  and  smash  the  glasses.  It's  an  old  Austrian  custom.   ["  ITTLE  Cora  Sue  Collins  has  al-  most an  obsession  against  having  her  name  transposed  to  Sue  Cora.  Someone  on  the  set  was  teasing  the  five-year-old  by  addressing  her  as  "Sue  Cora,"  and  we  found  out  why  she  objects.   "Thue  Cora,  indeed!"  she  ex-  claimed, with  haughty  indignation.  "Look  out  or  I'll  be  thueing  you!"   TF  you  want  to  hear  chatter  comparable  only  to  monkeys  in  an  African  jungle,  just  drop  into  any  make-up  department  on  any  lot  be-  tween eight  and  nine  in  the  morning.  The  actresses  must  be  on  the  sets  by  nine.  They  are  being  made  beautiful  for  an  hour  before  that.   It  took  Diana  Wynyard,  newcomer,  to  think  out  a  way  to  hear  herself  thinking  her  lines.  She  presented  M-G-M's  department  with  a  radio  set.   And  is  it  tuned  on  in  the  morning? — To  the  loudest.    "TF  Fredric  March  were  only  a  single  man,"  a  starlet  wailed  the  other  day.   And  that  seems  to  be  one  of  the  most  pop-  ular theme  songs  in  Hollywood  these  days.  Freddie  March  is  fast  becoming  the  local  hero.  '   Yet  he  is  always  home  in  time  for  dinner.  Wifie  Florence  Eldridge  doesn't  have  to  wait  for  her  hubby.   [  PLEASE  TURN  TO  PAGE  118  ]    Photoplay  Magazine  for  June,   1933    93    ing  these  reorganizations,  the  industry  will  emerge  on  a  solid  foundation.   There  is  no  let  down  of  activity — in  fact,  Hollywood  has  speeded  up  its  efforts  to  get  done  what  it  can.  There  is  no  moaning  or  wail-  ing, no  self-pity  for  the  individual  amid  con-  cern for  the  whole.  And  finally,  there  is  no  weakening  of  morale,  that  factor  which  among  all  factors,  financial  and  otherwise,  is  the  most  vital.   Meanwhile,  stars,  directors,  writers  and  all  the  rest  of  the  studio  folk  worked  cheerfully  either  for  half  pay  or  for  no  pay  at  all.  In  the  case  of  the  higher-paid  personnel,  of  course,  the  cut  was  not  so  meaningful.  A  prior  salary  of  five  thousand  dollars  a  week  still  meant  two  thousand  five  hundred.  No  actual  sacrifice  is  involved  here.   pERH APS  all  this  may  be  good  for  the  motion  *-  picture  industry.  In  the  final  analysis,  after  reorganization  shall  have  been  effected,  Holly-  wood may  again  resemble  the  Hollywood  of  old  — the  days  when  the  film  pioneers,  as  inde-  pendents, stood  upon  their  own  convictions,  fought  their  own  battles,  and  made  their  own  pictures.    And  good  pictures,  too.   That  the  future  will  be  as  the  old  past  is,  of  course,  neither  possible  nor  desirable.  But  out  of  the  ashes  of  its  mistakes,  Hollywood  is  re-  building a  new  structure  of  success.   Can  Hollywood  take  it?  From  the  humblest  script  girl  to  the  greatest  star,  Hollywood  pro-  claims that  she  can!

Jack,  who  still  "Yoo  Hoos"  at  everyone  from  his  dressing-room,  but  from  habit  only.   His  heart  isn't  in  it.  He  still  goes  about  delivering  speeches  exactly  like  an  old  Metho-  dist preacher.  But  it's  only  an  act  these  days.  Just  an  act.   "You  know,  I'm  not  so  sure  of  myself  any  more,"  he  said  the  other  day.   "Stop,"  I  screeched,  "you'll  bring  on  another  earthquake.    I  can't  bear  it."

Likeable,  to  be  sure.  But  don't  think  Jack  didn't  mean  it.   "V\  THY,  the  cocksure  Jack  Oakie  is  the  only  W  Jack  Oakie  Hollywood  knows.   "You  see,"  he  explains,  "when  I  try  that  sort  of  a  naive  look  I  always  give  on  the  screen,  I  just  feel  it  isn't  there.  I'm  acting  it  for  the  first  time.  It  just  doesn't  come  natural  any  more."   "  Look.  See  this  tooth  that  kind  of  sets  back  of  the  others  here  at  the  side?  Well,  that's  always  been  kind  of  an  Oakie  trade  mark.  People  always  know  the  old  Oakie  smile  by  that  tooth.   "Well,  I'm  having  it  fixed,"  he  admits.  "Doin'  away  with  the  old  Oakie  smile.  I  feel  older.    Different.   "I  want  to  get  in  there  and  play  hero  for  a  while.  Tired  of  kiddin'  all  the  time.

The  day  when  Hollywood  will  lose  its  good  old  sweat-shirty  Jack.  And  when  you  see  the  new  tooth — well,  it  will  be  all  over,  includ-  ing the  shouting.

Votes  are  flocking  in,  and  it  is  more  im-  portant than  ever  that  we  have  your  ballot  now,  to  help  us  award  this  supreme  honor  of  the  shadow  stage  world.   For  that  is  just  what  the  Photoplay  Gold  Medal  for  the  best  picture  of  the  year  means  in  screendom.  Other  fields  of  endeavor  have  their  Nobel  prizes,  their  Pulitzer  awards.  There  are  honorary  distinctions  in  motion  pic-  ture work,  too.  But  the  Photoplay  Gold  Medal,  weighing  123)^  pennyweights  and  made  from  the  design  by  Tiffany  and  Com-  pany, New  York,  is  the  greatest — for  it  is  the  distinction  which  you  and  all  the  other  movie-  goers of  the  land  award  by  your  votes.   It  means  much  to  you,  too,  when  you  think  of  it.  A  great  national  referendum  such  as  this  carries  tremendous  weight  throughout  all  producing  circles — points  unerringly  to  the  sort  of  picture  the  public  will  support  most  generously.  So  casting  your  vote  for  your  selection  adds  just  that  much  to  the  incentive  producers  and  studios  will  feel  to  give  you  more  as  good.   No  rules,  no  limitations,  restrict  you.  Out-  standing work  by  one  or  more  stars  naturally  will  count,  and  count  heavily.  But  you  will  remember  the  supporting  players — the  direc-    tion— settings  and  staging — and  of  course  the  merits  of  the  story  itself.  And  the  best  test,  the  one  which  no  doubt  will  decide  you  in  the  end,  is  the  one  of  which  picture  wears  best  with  you,  as  you  look  back  to  it,  and  compare  it  with  others  of  the  year,  and  with  those  you  are  see-  ing now.  The  picture  that  stands  out  best  is  the  one  for  which  you  will  vote.   To  aid  you  in  recollecting  which  were  the  pictures  of  1932,  we  print  a  list  below;  but  your  choice  is  not  limited  to  those  in  this  list.  If  you  consider  some  other  picture  superior,  and  it  was  released  in  1932,  you  are  perfectly  free  to  vote  for  it.   One  other  point:  While  the  picture  must  be  one  released  in  1932,  you  need  not  have  seen  it  in  that  year.  If  you  saw  it  this  year,  that  is  quite  all  right.   If  the  picture  was  reviewed  in  January  1933,  or  earlier,  it  was  certainly  a  1932  release.

[  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  56  ]    with  Douglas  Fairbanks,  Jr.,  and  Leslie  Howard.   Daisy  is  young,  slender,  blonde,  decorative —  but  not  in  the  Hollywood  sense.  Her  features  have  an  arresting  irregularity;  she  has  a  glori-  ous smile.  Intelligence  and  humor  look  out  of  her  eyes.  Her  clothes  are  smart,  with  a  pleas-  ing absence  of  gadgets.   She  regards  her  husband,  who  is  perhaps  fifteen  or  twenty  years  older  than  herself,  with  a  blending  of  adoration  and  just  enough  under-  standing.   Now,  having  struggled  with  impulse  a  moment,  she  took  the  bait.  It  was  too  much  for  her.    Her  Europe  was  being  maligned!   "But  America  is  too  new — it  has  no  tradi-  tions!" volleyed  Daisy.   "~L_TA!  How  can  you  say  a  thing  is  too  new?  -*■  -Mt  is  like  saying  'the  egg  is  too  fresh!'  "  Paul  leaped  in.  (When  a  Lukas  warms  to  a  cause,  there's  nothing  luke-warm  about  it!)  "It  has  traditions — they  are  like  the  country —  new!"     The  battle  was  on.   "How  can  a  tradition  be  new?"  dismissed  Daisy.  "It  has  to  be  old  before  it  is  a  tradi-  tion!"   "What's  wrong  with  a  young  tradition?"  demanded  Paul.  "In  Europe  too  many  things  are  worshiped  because  they  are  old.  The  people  accept  them.  They  do  not  have  the  enterprise  to  create  new  ones.  Their  imagina-  tions are  no  longer  fresh.  They  are  tired.  They  cannot  be  surprised.  It  is  youth  they  need —  vitality!  They  are  ponderous.  They  endure  inconveniences — discomforts.  You  remember  how  long  and  with  what  trouble  you  secured  a  telephone  at  your  mother's  house?"  Paul  triumphed.   The  discussion  waxed — always  intelligent,  interesting,  impersonal.   The  debaters  completely  forgot  the  existence  of  a  third  party — but  not  once  did  they  forget  themselves.   Not  once  did  either  of  them  take  that  unfair  advantage,  we  invariably  expect  in  a  domestic  discussion,  and  hurl  the  retort  cutting  or  per-  sonal. .  .  .  Or  hurl  anything  else!   Then,  abruptly,  the  discussion  ceased,  hung  suspended  in  mid-air.  They  still  had  a  grand  argument  left  on  their  hands,  practically  intact,  to  take  up  where  they  left  off  whenever  they  liked.   It  struck  me  that  this  was  not  a  bad  formula  for  a  happy,  enduring  marriage!   If  neither  one  ever  wins  the  argument,  there  will  always  be  something  left  to  talk  about!   "V\  7HEN  Paul  was  absent  from  the  room,  **  Daisy  confessed,  "Paul  has  a  withering  scorn  for  the  'yes>  dear'  technique.  He  is  furious,  sometimes,  with  my  views — but  he  is  positively  enraged  if  I  have  none!"   Daisy  talks  with  a  decided  but  charming  accent,  not  having  mastered  English  as  Paul  has.   Paul  disappeared  for  six  months,  when  talk-  ing pictures  arrived,  and  returned  to  the  screen  with  a  perfect  enunciation.   Another  token  of  meaning  it,  you  might  say,  about   becoming   American.   Many  other  foreign  actors — Tannines,  Negri,  Baclanova,  Varconi,  Banky — were  at  the  top  of  the  heap,  only  to  sink  into  near  oblivion  in  American  production  after  the  advent  of  sound,  because  they  could  not  or  would  not  learn  to  speak  unaccented  English.   Nor  is  his  feeling  about  citizenship  the  only  change  six  years  in  the  United  States  have  wrought  in  Paul  Lukas.

Women — women — women.  All  his  life  he  has  been  a  lover  of  women,  and  women  have  filled  his  life — a  procession  of  beautiful  women,  marching  through.   Now  he  talks  less  of  women  in  general — and  more  of  Daisy.  No  more  parades.  Daisy  is  all  women  in  one.   Lukas  says  American  women  cannot  be  fairly  judged  by  the  ones  in  Hollywood — and  he  knows  only  Hollywood.  "Here  they  cheat  too  easily  and  divorce  at  random.  The  Conti-  nental husband  seldom  hesitates  to  say  so  if  his  wife  is  guilty  of  any  misconduct.  She  is  sum-  marily divorced.   American  men  carry  their  gallantry  too  far—  they  always  allow  the  wife  to  secure  the  di-  vorce, and  then  pay  her  alimony!"  he  finishes,  incredulously.   Yet  in  spite  of  his  Americanization,  Lukas  makes  frank  admissions  that  you  could  not  drag  out  of  the  more  reserved — or  perhaps  more  self-conscious — native.   He  says:  "The  most  important  thing  in  life  is  love.     All  happiness,  all  homes,  all  obliga-    tions, are  in  direct  relation  to  it.  Men  are  such  bad  boys.   "If  their  life  is  not  complete  at  home,  they  go  seeking  elsewhere.   "That  begins  the  disintegration  of  the  whole  structure.   "  A  MERICAN  women  emphasize  beauty —  ■*Mn  their  dress.  They  are  the  most  alluring  in  the  world.   "But  appearance  isn't  all.  Else  why  so  many  divorces?   "Every  good  wife  should  also  be  a  good  sweetheart."   His  views  about  the  projected  adoption  throw  further  light  on  his  feelings.   "Once,"  he  said,  "I  thought  I  would  have  no  child  if  it  could  not  be  my  own.  But  I  have  recovered  from  my  snobbishness  about  adop-  tion. Every  man  wants  to  see  himself  per-  petuated, yes.  It  is  his  family  pride,  his  vanity.  But  I  do  not  think  even  heredity  is  infallible."   So  you  can  judge  for  yourself  how  com-  pletely Paul  Lukas  has  become  Americanized  in  spirit,  to  back  up  his  application  for  formal  citizenship.    The  Shadow  Stage    [continued  from  pack  61    GIRL  MISSING— Warners   IF  you  are,  too,  you'll  miss  just  fair  entertain-  ment. Glenda  Farrell  and  Mary  Brian  are  two  chorines,  stranded  in  Palm  Beach;  and  they  step  into  a  mix-up  which  includes  Ben  Lyon  as  a  sucker  bridegroom,  Peggy  Shannon  as  his  shakedown  bride,  a  kidnaping,  a  murder,  and  plenty  more.  Wisecracking  Glenda  finally  spots  the  villain  and  all  is  well.  The  acting's  as  good  as  the  story  permits.   ZOO  IN  BUDAPEST— Fox   A  N  excellent  climax,  and  an  interesting  •*Mheme.  Animals  are  the  motivating  force,  dominating  the  life  of  hero  Gene  Raymond,  and  through  him  that  of  Loretta  Young,  and  the  others.  A  tiger  is  the  menace;  an  elephant  the  true  hero.  Slow  dialogue,  but  a  good  story.   "M"—Nerofilm   IF  you  like  grim  realism,  superbly  done,  here  it  is  in  this  German  tale  of  a  city  terrorized  by  a  degenerate  child  murderer.  No  actual  horror  shown  (except  the  criminal) ;  but  it's  all  there  by  masterful  implication,  conveyed  with  thorough-going  German  detail.  Not  a  melo-  drama; it  is  tense,  serious  treatment  of  a  horror  theme.  English  subtitles.  Not  for  children.   MUSSOLINI  SPEAKS— Columbia   KEYED  on  the  clever  idea  of  showing  Mussolini  addressing  his  faithful  Black  Shirts  from  a  balcony — with  a  flashback  after  every  sentence  or  two,  to  show  the  achieve-  ment of  which  he  speaks.  Lowell  Thomas  interprets,  while  II  Duce's  facial  expressions  alone  are  worth  the  price  of  admission.  An  interesting,  even  though  intensely  partisan,  study  of  a  striking  personality.   A  SHRIEK  IN  THE  NIGHT— Allied   IN  fact,  shrieks  enough  to  make  the  flesh  shiver  and  the  hair  rise.  Well  done  shrieks,  too;  while  Ginger  Rogers,  Lyle  Talbot,  Pur-  nell  Pratt,  Harvey  Clark  and  Arthur  Hoyt  snap  out    grewsomeness    and    humor    with    a    fine    balance.  You  know  who's  doing  the  murders,  but  you're  scared  to  death  the  detective  doesn't!    Excellent  small-time  entertainment.   HERTHA'S  ERWACHEN  (HERTHA'S  AWAKENING)— UFA   T~\EPICTING  a  condition  that  will  go  on  as  -'—'long  as  the  world  itself.  About  a  trusting  little  country  lass  and  the  city  boy  who  for-  got. This  film  serves  as  a  very  valuable  object  lesson  for  youth,  rather  than  a  demor-  alization, as  first  supposed  by  the  censors.  A  touchingly  human  episode  from  life,  told  with  great  sincerity  and  candor.  In  German,  with  English  subtitles.   HUMANITY— Fox   A  LTHOUGH  lacking  originality  in  plot,  ■*Mhis  story  of  a  doctor  who  has  given  a  life-  time of  service  to  the  poor  and  hopes  his  son  will  follow  in  his  footsteps,  has  enough  heart  interest  and  appeal  to  make  it  a  fair  evening's  entertainment.  Ralph  Morgan  is  splendid  as  the  doctor,  while  Alexander  Kirkland  and  Boots  Mallory  are  more  than  adequate  in  their  parts.   DER  BRAVE  SUENDER  (THE  UPRIGHT  SINNER)—   Allianz  Tonfilm  Prod.   THIS  marks  the  film  debut  of  the  well-known  German  stage  star,  Max  Pallenberg.  Sent  to  Vienna  with  the  company's  funds,  he  spends  a  thousand  shillings  and  loses  the  re-  mainder trying  to  win  back  the  thousand  in  a  gambling  house.  Pallenberg's  performance  is  excellent,  though  the  comedy  is  a  bit  too  drawn  out.    English  captions.   CROSS  FIRE— RKO- Radio   TOM  KEENE,  the  mine  manager,  runs  things  on  the  up-and-up,  until  he  goes  to  war;  then  things  pop.  Four  colorful  old  citizens  take  the  law  in  their  own  hands,  when  one  is  double-crossed  by  the  new  manager.  Tom  gets  back  in  time  to  unsnarl  the  tangles.  But  there's  too  much  talk  and  not  enough  real  acting.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  June,   1933    97    THE  PHANTOM  BROADCAST—  Monogram   RALPH  FORBES  gives  an  excellent  per-  formance as  the  "shadow  voice"  of  a  radio  crooner.  Had  the  idea  of  the  "man  behind  the  man  at  the  mike"  been  held  to  that  it  could  have  been  great;  but  the  gang  menace  and  gun  molls,  murders  and  so  on,  merely  make  it  involved,  without  adding  interest.   LOVE  IN  MOROCCO—  Gaumont  British   """THERE  ought  to  be  a  law  prohibiting  for-  *■  bidden  love  between  unbelievers  and  un-  believably amateurish  Moorish  sweethearts  in  pictures  about  North  Africa.  Scenic  effects  and  photography  are  magnificent,  as  is  the  legionnaire-Spahi-Arab  mix-up;  but  the  badly-  acted,  creaking  romance  prevents  this  one-man  show  from  really  coming  off.   THE  DUDE  BANDIT— Allied   T_TOOT  GIBSON,  riding  a  grand  black  ■*■  -Miorse,  solves  the  mystery  of  the  murder  of  Dad  Mason,  his  old  friend  and  partner  and  father  of  the  girl  (Gloria  Shea)  he  loves.  Be-  sides Hoot  and  Gloria,  the  cast  includes  Skeeter  Bill  Robbins,  Hooper  Atchley,  Neal  Hart  and  several  others.  But  the  picture  falls  short  of  the  usual  Hoot  Gibson  standard.   OBEY  THE  LAW— Columbia   JUST  to  show  us  that  'neath  the  villainous  exterior  we've  been  seeing,  there  beats  a  heart  of  gold,  Leo  Carrillo  does  a  newly  naturalized  barber  who  practices  the  Golden  Rule,  even  when  treated  to  gangster  rackets  such  as  he  usually  is  seen  perpetrating.  Not  a  bad  idea,  what  with  aid  and  abetment  from  young  Dickie  Moore  and  Lois  Wilson,  to  say  nothing  of  Eddie  Garr  and  Henry  Clive.  But  it's  laid  on  too  thick.  They  could  have  re-  formed Leo  without  making  him  a  cream  puff.   FIRES  OF  FATE— Powers  Pictures   A  SHELL-SHOCKED  war  veteran,  ordered  ■*»■  to  rest,  selects  Egypt,  and  on  the  boat  meets  a  girl.  Together  they  go  through  many  desert  adventures,  and  there  are  excellent  shots  of  airplane  warfare  in  the  Arab  country.  Lester  Matthews  and  Kathleen  O'Regan  play  leads  well.  The  story  is  from  the  pen  of  A.  Conan  Doyle ;  but  Americans  will  find  it  slow.   AFTER  THE  BALL— Gaumont  British-  Fox   A  NAUGHTY-NAUGHTY  English  ■**■  musical,  based  on  a  previously  used  German  farce.  Basil  Rathbone,  intrigued  by  Esther  Ralston  at  a  masked  ball,  follows  her  home.  But  Esther  crosses  him  by  substituting  her  masked  maid  for  herself,  and  Basil  doesn't  tumble.  Well  mounted,  with  some  good  music;  but  it  simply  can't  get  the  proper  farce  tempo.   STRANGE  PEOPLE— Chesterfield   \\7E  are  inclined  to  think  the  "Strange  *»  People"  are  the  producers  who  made  it!  A  rather  obvious  mixture  of  several  horror  pictures  you  have  seen  lately,  with  the  set  from  "The  Old  Dark  House"  used  bodily.  Three  people  get  murdered,  instead  of  the  usual  one  or  two,  which  ought  to  introduce  more  horror,  but  somehow  doesn't.  Hale  Hamilton  is  as  good  as  possible.   MADE  ON  BROADWAY— M-G-M   JUST  a  protracted  yawn.  Bob  Montgomery  as  another  high-powered  press-agent,  falls  for  a  Bowery  broad,  gets  her  out  of  a  shooting  scrape,  and  then  goes  back  to  bis  ex.  Sally  Eilers,  as  the  on-the-make  girl  gives  a  swell  performance  but  it's  much  ado  about  nothing,  and  grand  troupers  like  Madge  Evans  and  Eugene  Pallette  are  wasted.

"The  middle  of  her  mouth  is  not  at  all  under  the  middle  of  her  nose!  See  lines  'A'  and  'B'.  The  curved  lines  show  how  tremendously  em-  phasized the  jaw-lines  are.  Dietrich's  screen  face  is  not  at  all  as  nature  made  it;  she  makes  up  to  impose  a  mask  over  her  true  face.  And  thereby  Dietrich  has  achieved  a  distinct  in-  dividuality which  mere  beauty  could  never  give  her.  .   "If  that's  a  tip,  madame,  make  the  best  of  it!  But  be  sure  you're  the  type  that  can  do  it  before  you  try!"   Joan  Crawford   "Like  Dietrich's,  Joan's  face  is  quite  mask-  like !  Joan  has  achieved  a  definite  individuality  in  place  of  the  beauty  that  nature  denied  her.  Her  features — nose,  eyes,  mouth — are  all  too  large  for  real  beauty.  But  Joan,  instead  of  trying  to  make  them  smaller  by  make-up,  has  only  added  to  their  size — and  has  achieved  her  own  true  distinctiveness!   "Also,  if  you'll  cover  all  her  face  save  her  forehead,  and  show  it  to  another  person,  and  ask,  'Is  that  a  man's  or  a  woman's  forehead?'  the  chances  are  you'll  get  the  answer:  'A  man's.'  True,  her  forehead  is  definitely  masculine.  Odd,  isn't  it,  that  such  a  quite  unfeminine  conglomeration  of  features  coull  be  transformed  so  artfully  into  a  certain  artistic  ensemble  that  passes  far  better  than  beauty? "   Constance  Bennett   "She's  not  beautiful,  but  she's  artful.  Her  profile  is  one  wherein  the  upper  part  is  com-  paratively back  from  the  lower  part — from  her  outstanding  chin.  And  because  her  jaw  is  so  very  pronounced,  her  best  pictures  are  the  'three-quarter  profile'  or  a  shot  such  as  the  photo  herewith — taken  at  an  angle  that,  by  force  of  perspective,  reduces  the  size  of  the  lower  face  while  it  brings  the  upper  face  bigger.  If  you'll  watch,  you'll  see  the  majority  of  her  photographs  so  taken.  Photographers  know  the  trick  of  using  perspective  to  make  faces  look  less  unbeautiful.   "However,  despite  all   this,  Constance    Mascara    QELLl'.E    CO..   CHICAGO    Bennett  certainly  is  admirable  to  look  at.  She  has  a  trick  of  looking  perpetually  as-  tounded at  the  world,  like  a  child.  And  the  contrast  of  her  small  mouth  and  large  eyes  to  the  great  surface  of  her  face  helps  in  this,  and  she  knows  enough  to  accentuate  that  quality."   So!  There  you  have  Pogany's  "Unbeautiful  Beauties  of  Hollywood."  And  the  "why"  of  it.    And  you'll  probably  say:   "Bosh  to  all  your  twaddle  about  technical  beauty  and  academic  beauty  and  classic  beauty,  Mr.  Pogany!  You  can  have  it,  and  I'll  keep  my  Hollywood  standards,  and  I'll  be  the  winner. "   And  Pogany  would  just  grin  and  say:   "Yes,  my  friend,  you're  right.  Because  'beauty'  as  we  diagram  it  academically  would  be  horrible  to  live  with.  You'd  call  her  Dumb  Dora  in  two  days!  These  girls  I've  picked  apart,  just  now,  are  not  beautiful  in  the  academic  sense,  true.  But  I,  as  a  living  male  and  not  as  a  technician,  can  tell  you  that  I  wouldn't  swap  one  of  these  'unbeautiful  Hollywood  beauties'  for  all  the  truly  beautiful  goddesses  of  history,  mythology  and  what  else!   "Perfection  is,  after  all,  only  an  ideal.  It  can  exist  only  in  goddesses.  But  they'd  have  no  sex-appeal  to  go  with  it.  And  even  ideal  beauty  varies  I've  used,  herein,  the  academic  standard.  But  to  an  Eskimo,  it  would  be  gibberish,  wouldn't  it?  Nor  would  a  native  of  the  African  jungles  agree  that  either  our  academic  beauty  or  the  Eskimo  idea  of  beauty  would  be  beautiful;  the  African  would  have  a  different  ideal  again. "   When  Pogany  gave  Photoplay  this  article,  somebody  kidded  him  like  this:   "You  must  be  a  brave  man — or  you  must  have  a  return  ticket  to  Hungary  ready  in  your  pocket.  Because  when  it's  printed  Hollywood  will  be  hot  for  you,  eh?"   And  Pogany  grinned  and  said :   "But  why?  It  is  the  truth,  what  I  say.  I  gave  you  the  pictures  to  prove  it."  Then  he  added:   "And  anyway,  when  I  say  and  prove  that  they're  not  beautiful,  technically  and  academ-  ically, I  want  them  to  know,  too,  that  they  are  certainly  attractive,  charming,  challenging,  intriguing — far  more  than  they  would  be  if  all  they  had  was  merely  classical,  academic  beauty."    Joan  Crawford?  Nothing's  right;  but  she  achieves  charm  anyway!  Emphasizes  eyes   for   effect    Here's  Connie  Bennett,  playing  down  a  feature  not  correctly  classic.

No  need  for  a  producer  to  suggest  any  other!   Al  Green  directed  Mr.  Arliss'  three  first  Warner  Bros,  productions;  John  Adolphi  the  last  seven.  A  knowledge  of  these  two  men  gives  us  the  necessary  explanation  of  the  change.   Green  has  been  directing  Hollywood  suc-  cesses for  more  years  than  Arliss  has  been  making  them.  Al  makes  pictures  as  Holly-  wood understands  them.  And  his  word  is  law  upon  his  productions.   John  Adolphi  is  a  likeable,  somewhat  noisy  and  sometimes  profanely-amusing,  good-  natured  man  who  knows  his  camera  from  every  angle  but  who  doesn't  worry  about  the  way  Hollywood  makes  pictures.  It's  the  way  Arliss  makes  them  that  rates  with  Adolphi — and  what  counts  with  Arliss.  Complete  harmony  every  moment.   HOW  would  you  like  to  wrestle  with  the  problem  of  choosing  stories  for  George  Arliss?   Although  few  knew  it,  when  Arliss  returned  to  England  the  last  time  he  had  no  further  con-  tract to  make  pictures  in  America.  There  were  no  stories  suitable  to  both  the  studio  and  Mr.  Arliss.   "The  Millionaire,"  which  was  released  after  his  departure,  proved  a  sensation.  It  made  money;  big  money.  Producers  must  always  have  actors  back  who  make  big  money.  They  sent  a  man  to  England  to  return  George  Arliss  to  them.   But  George  Arliss  may  be  through  with  pictures.  His  arrangement  with  Warner  Bros,  is  at  an  end,  and  yet  there  is  reason  to  believe  he  may  make  two  a  year  for  either  Warner  Bros,  or  Metro.    If —   Probably  no  one  appreciates  that  "if"  more  than  George  Arliss.  You  will  remember  he  once  said  that  the  trouble  in  finding  vehicles  for  him  lay  in  the  fact,  "  It  is  impossible  to  fade  out  on  one  of  my  kisses!"   Many  explain  George  Arliss  with  the  expres-  sion, "He's  English."  I  question  that  explana-  tion.   Englishmen  are  as  human  as  Americans.   But  I  do  believe  some  of  his  ideals  may  be    A  Revolution  Is  Going  On   in  the  world  of  motion  pictures  today.   The  great  drama  is  changing  from  month  to   month.

IOO    Photoplay  Magazine  for  June,  1933   credited  to  the  different  viewpoints  of  the  two  peoples.  Censorship  in  England,  for  example,  is  based  upon  the  likes  and  dislikes  of  the  people  of  that  country.  There  was  a  scene  in  an  American  picture,  recently  sent  to  England  for  release,  where  two  very  old  people  (they  looked  at  least  eighty !)  sat  upon  the  edge  of  a  bed  in  their  "nighties."  The  scene  was  eliminated  by  the  English  censors  for  immoral  reasons!   So  perhaps  Mr.  Arliss'  dislike  of  bedroom  scenes  is  typical  of  his  nation.   He  has  not  always  been  a  vegetarian.  Dur-  ing one  of  his  early  trips  to  California,  he  travelled  by  auto  with  Mrs.  Arliss.  A  drought  was  devastating  our  great  pasture  states.  Cows  and  sheep  tumbled  to  their  deaths  before  their  eyes.  Mrs.  Arliss  said:  "If  that  is  the  way  they  treat  animals,  we  eat  vegetables."   But  they  are  not  fanatics  on  the  subject.    Direction:     S.

An  extra  large  portion  of  fish  is  served  the  host  and  hostess  during  the  fish  course  and  the  plates  not  removed  for  the  meat  course.   Arliss  believes  pictures  to  be  the  medium  to  carry  messages  to  the  millions.  The  messages  which  his  name  will  carry  will  be  the  beliefs  of  George  Arliss — not  those  of  Hollywood  pro-  ducers.   To  him,  his  beliefs  are  right.   Perhaps  the  two  pictures  a  year  is  the  best  solution.  If  writers  can  find  two  stories  every  twelve  months  which  blend  the  idealism  of  Arliss  with  the  box-office  practicability  of  his  producer,  both  will  be  fortunate.   It  is  interesting  to  note  that  George  Arliss  owns  two  homes  in  England  and  an  own-your-  apartment  in  New  York.  He  has  always  rented  in  Hollywood.  He  is  too  shrewd  to  invest  money  in  a  town  which  he  may  decide  to  leave  at  any  moment!

"Don't  you  think,  Ernest,"  he  said,  "now  that  it's  over,  it  would  be  a  good  idea  to  go  in  and  put  your  pants  on!"   Krnest  glanced  down.  The  look  froze  on  his  face.  There  he  stood  in  his  shirt  tail,  his  long  bare  legs  exposed.   Three  prop  boys  and  a  dazed  carpenter  were  trampled  half  silly  by  Ernest  trying  to  get  into  his  dressing-room  again.   A  scene  from  "Captured"  was  in  progress.  Leslie  Howard,  Douglas  Fairbanks,  Jr.,  and  fifty  extra  men  were  stripping  for  a  "delousing"  scene.    The  set  was  barred  to  visitors.   Across  the  way  "The  Gold  Diggers  of  1933"  was  in  progress.  With  scores  of  little  cuties  in  a  nickel's  worth  of  gold  braid  standing  about  on  high,  overhanging  balconies.   Came  the  shake.  The  stripped  men  grabbed  towels,  shoes,  anything  and  nothing  and  ran  for  the  open.  Electricians  stood  under  the  balconies  and  grabbed  blonde  cuties  as  they  fell.    All  rushed  to  the  open.   SUDDENLY  Dick  Barthelmess  stuck  out  his  head  from  an  upstairs  window.  "  My  Gawd,"  he  screamed,  "a  nudist  cult."  And  slammed  down  the  window.   Seventeen  writers  and  eight  actors  have  since  applied  for  the  job  as  electrician  on  the  "Gold  Diggers"  set.  So  they  can  stand  under  balconies  and  catch  cuties.   Ruth  Chatterton,  George  Brent  and  Ralph  Forbes,  all  in  one  car,  were  on  their  way  to  Ruth's  mother's  home  for  dinner.  The  earth  rocked.   "Jarring  a  bit,"  Ruth  calmly  announced,  her  accent  perfect.   "Rawth-er,"  Forbes  agreed.   "Beastly  annoying,"  said  Ruth.   "Fearfully,"  said  Ralph.   "  Seems  to  be  an  earthquake  of  sorts,"  joined  in  Brent.   "  Rawth-er,"  agreed  Forbes.   "Frightfully  unnecessary,"  said  Ruthie.   "Oh,  frightfully,"  said  Ralphie.   "Quite  frightfully,"  agreed  Georgie.   And  drove  on  to  mamma's.    For  dinner.   Arline  Judge  and  husband,  Wesley  Ruggles,  were  visiting  brother  Charlie  Ruggles.  Two  blocks  away  the  new  baby  slept  in  his  own  crib.   Suddenly,  the  house  turned  around  twice  and  did  a  leap  frog  to  the  left.   Like  a  shot,  Arline  was  out  of  the  house  and  up  the  street,  Wesley  after  Arline,  Charlie  after  Wesley,  the  cook  after  Charlie,  the  gardener  waving  the  rake  after  the  cook,  the  dog  after  the  gardener  and  three  stray  cats  after  the  whole  party.   Up  the  street  they  tore  like  maniacs.  "Well,"  piped  Lil  Tashman  from  her  upstairs  window,    "fine  time  to  be  having  a  parade."  And  banged  down  the  window.   Kay  Francis  slept  on.   The  mountain  shook  beneath  Ann  Harding's  car.  Tightly  she  hung  onto  the  wheel  as  the  car  climbed  the  dangerous  road  to  her  home.  At  the  house  Ann  found  the  Chinese  boy  in  his  stocking  feet  on  the  roof.  Waving  a  loaf  of  bread.   "Earthquakers,"  he  screamed  at  Ann.   "How  did  you  know?"  Ann  called  back.   "I  felt  him  in  my  feet,"  the  Chinese  yelled  back  and  went  right  on  waving  the  loaf  of  bread.   Will  Rogers  was  in  a  group  seated  around  a  conference  table  at  the  studio.  The  earth  rocked  and  Will  looked  around  through  that  forelock  of  hair.   "You  know,"  he  said  with  that  slow  drawl  of  his,  "I  knew  as  soon  as  Louis  B.  Mayer  turned  Democrat  something  like  this  would  happen. "-   Freddie  March  had  gone  visiting  on  the  "In-  ternational House"  set  and  was  just  holding  a  match  to  W.  C.  Fields'  cigarette.  "Steady,"  Fields  said  when  the  jerk  came.  The  flame  caught  Fields  squarely  on  the  end  of  his  nose.  With  a  yelp  like  a  dog  with  a  can  on  his  tail,  he  went  tearing  around  the  lot,  kicking  up  his  heels.  Twenty  minutes  later  he  was  still  yelp-  ing and  kicking.   While  Kay  Francis  slept  on.   Dietrich  was  just  signing  an  autograph.  She  had  just  reached  the  "D"  when  the  whole  world  rocked  and  her  pen  went  slithering  across  the  picture.  Doors  rattled.  Windows  shook.  Marlene  looked  around  in  astonish-  ment. "My  heavens,"  her  little  hairdresser  said,  "I'll  bet  Von  Sternberg's  back."   BABY  LeROY  swayed  in  his  baby  carriage.  First  to  one  side.  Then  the  other.  "Da  da  da,"  he  cooed.  Delighted  with  it  all.  And  then  the  quake  stopped.  Immediately  LeRoy  set  up  a  howl.    He  wanted  more.   So  two  writers,  one  director  and  three  ex-  ecutives took  turns  for  three  hours.  Playing  earthquake.    For  LeRoy.   A  meeting  of  the  studio  heads  was  in  prog-  ress concerning  salary  cuts  and  the  possibility  of  shutting  clown  the  studios.  Suddenly,  the  earthquake  hit  and  a  few  minutes  later,  the  phone  tinkled.   "Listen,"  the  wag  on  the  other  end  of  the  phone  said  to  a  trembling  executive,  "this  is  St.  Peter  talking !  This  is  just  a  sample  of  what  will  happen  if  there  are  any  more  cuts.  Under-  stand?"   "Yes,  sir,"  the  frightened  executive  gulped  and  fell  in  a  swoon.   As  mild  as  an  April  day,  Louise  Closser  Hale  strolled  into  the  M-G-M  publicity  office  calmly  wiping  her  glasses.    "You  know,"  she  said,  "I    Photoplay  Magazine  for  June,  1933    IOI    really  must  do  something  about  my  glasses.  It  just  looks  as  though  everything  was  going  up  and  down."   Dorothy  Wilson  was  on  the  floor  with  a  jig-  saw puzzle.  All  day  she  had  worked  and  figured.  Now,  only  one  piece  remained.  And  then!  Zowie!  The  floor  rocked  and  swayed.  The  puzzle  flew  to  pieces.  Dorothy  is  still  hunting  parts.   JOHN  BARRYMORE  grabbed  May  Robson  •/and  stood,  nonchalantly  lighting  a  cigar.   "\Yh — what  is  it?"  she  gasped.

Suddenly,  the  piano  went  thump,  thump,  thump.  There  was  a  long,  sour  note.  Rogers  leaped  out  the  window.  Hart  leaped  after  him.  While  a  pop-eyed  truck  driver  leaned  from  his  truck  and  yelled,  "Hey,  what's  going  on  in  there?  You  guys  is  shaking  de  whole  building."   Tom  Brown  leaped  from  his  tub  and,  wrapped  in  a  towel,  found  himself  ten  minutes  later,  under  a  neighbor's  davenport,  unable  to  come  out  as  the  neighbor's  daughter  lay  on  the  davenport.  He  didn't  know  she  was  in  a  dead  faint.  Six  hours  later,  Tom,  sniffling  and  sneezy,  managed  to  sneak  out,  unnoticed.   At  the  Brown  Derby  that  night,  a  badly  shaken  up  crowd  of  movie  stars  sat  at  dinner.   Suddenly,  another  heave  and  Groucho  Marx  leaped  to  his  feet.   "Ladies  and  gentlemen,"  he  announced.  "This  time  tomorrow  night — a  volcano."   And  Kay  Francis  slept  on.    You  Can't  Bury  Dead  Love   [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  33  ]    forget  about  it,  Menjou  went  to  the  Mayfair —  and  found  his  wife  seated  at  the  next  table !  Eventually  they  saw  they  were  caught  in  the  Hollywood  whirlpool,  and  decided  to  try  again  to  make  a  go  of  marriage.   Bobbe  Arnst  divorced  Johnny  Weissmuller.  A  few  days  later,  still  shaken  by  the  experience,  she  was  called  to  the  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  studios.  She  went  into  the  commissary  for  luncheon.  The  only  table  she  could  find  was  within  a  few  feet  of  Weissmuller,  lunching  with  Lupe  Velez,  then  reported  to  have  won  Johnny's  affections.  One  can  only  imagine  Bobbe's  emotions.   LUPE,  the  fiery  little  wildcat  of  Hollywood,  who  holds  the  record  for  having  sweethearts,  once  turned  the  full  glare  of  her  appeal  on  John  Gilbert.  They  were  "teamed"  for  a  while.  Then  came  Virginia  Bruce,  now  Mrs.  John  Gilbert.   One  bright  morning  Lupe  arrived  at  the  studio  to  find  that  she  and  Virginia  had  been  cast  to  play  opposite  each  other  in  "Kongo."   Just  another  unavoidable  reminder  of  a  by-  gone love.   If  one  is  inclined  to  hear  a  wild  tirade  from  the  fast-moving  lips  of  Lupe,  all  one  need  do  is  mention  Gary  Cooper,  whom  she  cannot  heln  but  see  frequently.  The  memory  of  that  torrid  love  affair  comes  rushing  back,  and  Lupe  doesn't  split  an  infinitive  telling  the  world  what  she  thinks.   The  ghost  of  dead  love  often  becomes  a  terror,  too.  Lila  Lee  and  James  Kirkwood  give  an  example  of  this.  Although  they  had  called  their  marriage  quits,  they  were  constantly  thrown  together  after  their  divorce,  which  in-  cluded a  bitter  battle  for  custody  of  their  son.  Not  so  long  ago,  Lila  visited  the  Mayfair  with  Johnny  Farrow,  the  scenario  writer.   Kirkwood  arrived.    *&£>    O    o    o    c    The  most  reliable  shops  are  sellingCompo  Shoes  this  year,  millions  of  pairs,  in  prac-  tically all  prices  and  grades.

Photoplay  Magazine  for  June,  1933   Kirkwood  danced  by  her  table.  He  glared  at  her.    Frightened,  Lila  and  Johnny  departed.   A  situation  like  this  could  have  been  avoided  in  any  other  town  in  the  world — for  one  or  the  other  involved  could  have  long  since  left  the  community.  Kirkwood,  actor,  and  Lila  Lee,  actress,  had  to  stay  for  professional  reasons.   T  ILA'S  love  boomeranged  again  only  a  few  -"months  ago.   She  heard  a  pounding  on  the  door  and  went  to  answer  it.   ''Miss  Lee,  I  had  to  come  to  you.  I'm  Beatrice  Powers,  Jim  Kirkwood's  wife.  We've  quarreled  and — well,  you  know  him  so  thor-  oughly that  you're  the  only  woman  who  can  advise  me.    What'll  I  do?  "   "Come  inside  and  wait  until  he  cools  off,"  Lila  replied.   And  so  the  first  wife  was  hostess  to  the  second  wife  for  several  days.  Lila  couldn't  have  escaped  the  situation — so  she  had  to  face  it.    And  she  did  a  brave  job.   Helene  Costcllo,  after  she  and  Lowell  Sher-  man, her  husband,  waded  knee-deep  in  mud  through  a  divorce  hearing,  decided  to  relax.  She  went  to  "The  Frolics,"  a  night  club.  She  had  not  been  there  long  when  Sherman  and  a  party  of  friends  entered.   Sherman  took  one  look  at  her,  whirled  and  stalked  out  of  the  place.  Since  that  experience,  Helene  has  been  one  of  those  who,  faced  with  the  choice  of  giving  up  career  and  friends  or  remaining  in  Hollywood  to  have  dead  love  resurrected  by  occasional  encounters,  have  gone  away.    1H    ForYo»"»   ely'es    K-*IT  i    She  married  Arturo  del  Barrio,  Cuban  lawyer,  and  fled  from  her  shattered  love.   Others  have  given  up  careers,  friends,  homes.  This  means  a  tremendous  sacrifice  to  get  away  from  the  spot  where  a  troth  was  plighted  or  a  kiss  exchanged.  The  second  Mrs.  Walter  Huston,  aided  by  a  considerable  property  settlement  which  couldn't  heal  her  aching  heart,  went  East,  leaving  Walter  with  his  third  wife.   Vivian  Duncan  deserted  the  unhappy  scenes  of  her  marriage  to  Nils  Asther.   Today,  Hollywood  wonders  about  the  out-  come of  two  current  divorces.  What  will  be  the  attitude  of  Lew  Ayres  and  Lola  Lane  when  they  meet  in  public?  The  impression  is  that  they  will  face  the  music,  for  Lew  is  a  star  chained  to  his  work  and  Lola,  who  gave  up  the  screen  to  be  a  housewife,  plans  a  comeback.   A  LTHOUGH  they  agreed  to  separate  in  -**-Xovember,  at  Christmas  they  sent  gifts  to  friends  with  good  wishes  signed  "from  Lew  and  Lola."  In  January,  with  the  divorce  proceed-  ings under  way,  they  were  seen  at  El  Mirador  at  Palm  Springs,  chaperoned  by  Bruce  Cabot.  Janet  Gaynor,  divorced  from  Lydell  Peck,  is  at  work  in  "Adorable."  Again,  because  of  the  small  circle  that  is  Hollywood,  a  dead  love  refuses  to  stay  covered.  It's  inevitable  that  they'll  meet,  and  Hollywood  wants  to  know  whether  there'll  be  a  friendly  greeting  or  a  deliberate  snub.  For  the  ghosts  of  dead  love  can't  remain  interred  in  Hollywood.  They're  bound  to  bob  up  and  grin  just  when  movie  couples  least  expect  the  visit.

That  sweet  face — the  sweetest  I  ever  saw — with  tears  running  down  his  cheeks,  w-as  more  than  I  could  stand.  I  had  to  leave  the  room.  I  was  crying  so  hard.  .  .  .   The  people  here  in  Europe  are  walking  around  the  streets  without  shoes  in  this  bitter  cold.  It's  desperate.  We're  lucky — we  don't  know  how  lucky  we  are.  Why,  comparing  us  to  them,  there  isn't  any  depression  in  America.   Pray  heaven,  it  will  never  be  so  bad  for  us  as  it  is  for  them!   Jan.  10th. — In  Reims,  the  funniest  thing  is  you  don't  see  any  people  between  thirty-  live  and  forty-five  years  old.  That  genera-  tion was  all  wiped  out.   We  decided  to  visit  Reims  because  Count  Yallombrosa  gave  us  a  letter  to  his  friend,  the  Count  de  Polignac.  We  lunched  with  the  Count  and  his  brother,  the  Marquis,  one  day,  and  the  Count  asked  us  down  to  Reims  to  visit  his  ancestral  castle,  and  go  through  his  wine  caves  to  see  how  champagne  is  made.  The  Count  de  Polignac  owns  the  Pommery  Greno  champagne  cellars — the  largest  in  the  world.   I'd  heard  a  lot  about  the  battlefields,  but  I'd  no  idea  they  looked  like  what  we  saw  that  day.   It  was  terribly  muddy  and  terribly  dan-  gerous to  walk  around  in  ordinary  clothes.  Everything  was  left  just  exactly  the  way  it  was  during  the  war.  Barbed  wires  all  over  the  place;  huge  ditches  in  which  you  sank  waist-deep  in  the  mud;  sharp  pieces  of  shell  sticking  out  of  the  ground — it  was  terrible!   I  put  on  a  pair  of  the  Count's  trench  boots.  They  reached  right  up  to  my  waist.   So  I  started  walking  around  and  looking  at  this  thing  called  war.  I  can't  help  writing  about  it.    I've  got  to  get  it  out  of  my  system.    Thinking  about  the  horror  cf  it,  I  just  can't  go  to  sleep.   I  saw  an  old  shoe  stuck  in  a  barbed  wire,  and  all  sorts  of  pieces  of  clothing,  too.  There  were  bayonets  sticking  out  of  the  ground  and  broken  bits  of  shell  and  shrapnel.  I  just  kept  on  walking  around,  kind  of  crying.   I  could  see  those  men  so  clearly — lying  there  in  the  trenches  (and  believe  me,  they  were  some  trenches)  waiting  for  the  shrieking  noise  to  stop,  or  waiting  to  be  blown  to  bits.   There  were  bones  around  too,  and  skulls,  and  over  by  one  of  the  barbed  wires  I  saw  a  German  helmet.  Rex  and  I  went  over  to  pick  it  up.  When  I  stooped  down,  a  barbed  wire  caught  my  boot  and  ripped  it  right  from  the  ankle  straight  up  to  the  knee.  If  I'd  been  wearing  ordinary  shoes  and  stockings,  it  would  have  ripped  my  leg  to  pieces.   Lord,  I  kept  thinking  how  awful  it  must  have  been  to  be  out  in  that  slime  and  rain,  with  shells   bursting   about   one.   I  could  hardly  stand  it,  so  they  made  me  come  away.   And,  maybe  this  sounds  queer,  but  I  did  take  a  little  piece  of  bone  I  found  there  home  with  me,  as  a  kind  of  talisman —  In  the  old  days,  people  used  to  carry  bones  of  the  saints  around  for  good  luck,  and  those  boys  who  fell  in  the  war  sure  seemed  to  be  saints  to  me.   Visited  the  military  cemeteries.  Crosses  for  miles,  as  far  as  you  could  see!  I  thought  of  "Flanders  Fields,"  and  the  blood-red  poppies  that  grew  there,  and  I  thought,  "We  Americans  who  didn't  have  to  cross  the  big  pond  to  fight,  don't  understand  what  it  was  all  about."  And  I  kept  on  thinking  all  the  time  I  was  in  Europe  how  lucky  we  Americans  are.   Jan.  lllli. — Last  night  at  dinner,  the  Count  served  some  Pommery  champagne.  He  and  his  brother,  the  Marquis,  are  charming  gentle-  men— so  cultured.  They  know  so  much  about  everything.  They  told  us  many  in-  teresting stories  about  the  war.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  Junk,   1933    10    After  dinner  the  Count  showed  us  around  the  chateau.  I've  never  seen  anything  like  it  in  my  life.  We  think  we  have  swell  places  in  Hollywood.  Hollywood  ought  to  take  a  look  at  this.   Furniture;  tapestries;  silver  with  the  family  crest;  a  wonderful  library  (thousands  of  books,  and  manuscripts  written  in  long  hand);  paintings  which  must  have  cost  a  fortune —  and  everything  hundreds  of  years  old.  The  Count  is  a  great  collector,  and  had  an  in-  teresting story  to  tell  about  everything  in  his  house.   It  made  me  want  to  work  ami  work  so  1  could  come  over  and  retire.  And  live  in  a  house  like  this,  set  in  a  wonderful  park — with  lakes  and  polo  fields  and  tennis  courts  and  a  golf  course  and  swimming  pools  and  stables  and  kennels —   Gee,  it  was  like  a  dream.   Jan.  12th. — Today  we  saw  the  wine  cellars.  Rex  and  I  had  looked  forward  to  this,  which  is  quite  natural  for  us  Americans  who  don't  get  a  chance  even  to  smell  the  real  stuff  at  home.   Walked  down  miles  of  twisting  stone  steps  to  the  caves  underneath  the  castle  where  the  wine  is  made.  It's  a  kind  of  underground  cellar  that  extends  for  miles.   It's  old  and  dreary  like  a  dungeon,  stones  above  and  around  you,  and  everywhere  you  look.  As  you  walk,  it  rains  all  the  time — I  mean,  the  water  keeps  dripping  from  the  rocks.  On  all  sides  and  on  every  level  of  the  rocks  there  were  bottles — bottles — bottles,  with  champagne  aging  in  them —  Ten  million  botllcs  the  Count  told  us  were  in  that  cellar  then.   They  were  stacked  right  up  to  the  ceiling,  which  was  enormously  high.  Some  bottles  were  as  tall  as  I  am,  and  the  Count  showed  me  they  were  actually  filled  with  champagne.  Oh,  boy!   Along  the  stone  floor  were  barrels  of  the  fermenting  juice.  It  remains  in  them  for  six  months — the  first  step  in  making.   In  the  second  step  the  grape  juice  ("that's  what  it  really  is)  is  put  in  bottles  tilted  on  trays.  For  seven  weeks,  every  day,  men  go  from  one  bottle  to  the  other  and  give  them  each  three  rapid  twists.  This  starts  the  sediment  up  from  the  bottom  of  the  bottles  to  the  top.  There's  an  art  in  giving  those  bottles  just  the  right  twist.  Because  if  it  isn't  done  right,  all  the  sediment  doesn't  reach  the  top  and  that  means  the  quality  of  the  champagne  is  affected.   Finally,  the  sediment  is  scooped  off  from  the  top — I  forget  how  exactly — anyway,  it's  supposed  to  be  done  without  uncorking  the  bottle.   Very  tricky.      Sounds  like  Iloudini  to  me.    $1,500.00   IN  CASH  PRIZES    will  be  divided  among  the  winners  of  a  unique  contest  that  starts  in  the  next,  the  July,  is-  sue of  PHOTOPLAY.

Wish  I  could  put  some  in  my  memory  book!   Jan.  15th. — I  forgot  to  write  about  visit-  ing the  cathedral  at  Reims.  They're  restoring  it  now.  I  sure  can  understand  having  religion  in  a  place  like  that.  When  the  light  came  through  the  stained  glass  windows,  I  felt  all  trembly  inside.  So  different  from  the  way  I  feel  outside,  living  my  ordinary  life.   The  Count  says  Reims  was  almost  wiped  out;  all  the  houses  burned  to  the  ground,  the  big  buildings  and  cathedral  bombarded,  until  parts  of  the  thick  stone  walls  which  have  been  standing  for  centuries  just  crumbled  to  the  ground.    During  the  worst  part  of  the  siege,  the  cathedral  was  used  as  a  place  to  put  the  wounded.  And  it  got  so  bad  that  the  Red  Cross  made  rows  of  beds  from  pallets  of  straw.  They  piled  French,  German  and  Belgian  wounded  soldiers  on  them.   They  thought  at  least  the  cathedral  was  safe  from  bombing.   But  it  was  bombarded  anyway.  This  set  the  straw  on  fire  and  the  wounded  in  the  cathedral  were  all  killed.  I  couldn't  help  cry-  ing at  that  story — so  Rex  said,  "You  mustn't  take  it  so  seriously,  Punkin — it's  over  now!"   Thinking  over  everything  I  saw  in  Europe,  I  think  that  visit  to  Reims  made  a  deeper  im-  pression on  me  than  everything  else  I  saw  or  did.  Even  though  it  wasn't  so  much  fun  as  St.  Moritz.   I'm  certainly  going  back  some  day!    Jackie  Is  Head  Man    CONTINUED  FRO II  PAGE  37    The  "big  break"  in  the  boy's  career  came  when  Paramount  Studios  made  "Skippy" —  that  filmization  of  the  Percy  Crosby  comic  strip  that  adorns  many  a  newspaper  page.  Norman  Taurog  directed  "  Skippy"  —  and  Norman  Taurog  is  the  husband  of  the  sister  of  Jackie's  mother.  Jackie  was  "borrowed"  from  Producer  Hal  Roach  to  play  the  title  role  in  "Skippy."   SKIPPY  "  turned  him  to  that  floodlighted,  press-agent-lined,  ballyhoo-cluttered  road  of  unreality — film  stardom.  It  suddenly  brought  into  his  household,  through  his  hands,  an  income  of  $1 ,300  a  week.  It  turned  his  life  and  the  lives  of  those  with  whom  he  lived  topsy-turvy.   And  the  most  significant  development  of  all,  so  far  as  the  boy  is  concerned:  Jackie  Cooper's  life  ceased  to  be  his  own;  it  became  virtually  everybody  else's!   The  State  of  California  stepped  in.  In  the  first  place,  by  law,  Jackie's  $l,300-a-week  con-  tract— Jackie  being  a  minor — had  to  be  okayed  by  the  Superior  Court.  Jackie's  mother's  motherhood  was  not  sufficient  to  permit  her  to  handle  Jackie's  income.  She  had  to  go  into  court  and  be  appointed  legal  guardian,  as  well,  to  Jackie  Cooper,  minor,  so  she  could  ad-  minister his  income.   For  this,  the  court  set  aside  for  her  as  salary  from  her  son,  $75  a  week.  That's  her  own  money.  Then  the  court  authorized  the  paying  of  another  $75  per  week  to  Jackie's  grand-  mother for  services  as  "companion."  That  disposed,  legally,  of  $150  per  week  of  the  SI, 300.   HPHEN  a  tentative  schedule  of  expenses  was  *-  drawn  up,  submitted  and  finally  okayed.  It  provided  $1,600  per  month  for  necessary  expenses — Jackie's  clothes,  professional  re-  quirements, home,  household  expenses,  food.  Spending  that  $1,600  a  month  is  entirely  within  the  discretion  of  Mabel  Leonard  Cooper.  But  nothing  more  of  Jackie's  income  may  be  invested,  disposed  of,  spent  in  any  way  without  specific  approval  of  the  Superior  Court.   Like  all  movie  contracts,  Jackie's  includes  a  lay-off  clause.  The  $l,300-a-week  salary  is  for  a  total  of  forty  weeks  during  the  year —  which  makes  Jackie's  annual  income  $52,000;  about  $4,333  a  month.  Subtract  from  that  the  allowances  and  you  have  about  $2,500  per  month  surplus.    What  becomes  of  that?   A  large  slice  of  it  goes  into  insurance.  There  is  one  $50,000  endowment  policy.  Jackie  will  get  the  $50,000  at  the  age  of  twenty-one.  Another  policy  indemnifies  Jackie's  mother  to  the  amount  of  $50,000  in  case  of  Jackie's  death.  This  makes  a  total  of  $100,000  in  insurance  policies,  the  premiums  of  which  are  paid  out  of  that  s$2,500.    Then  they're  buying  Jackie  a  house.  It's  in  Beverly  Hills — the  "ultra-ultra"  section  where  the  richest  movie  stars  live.  It's  a  corner  house,  and  it  has  a  great  concrete  swimming  pool  in  the  backyard,  where  Jackie  can  splash  around,  sometimes  with  his  friend  Johnny  Weissmuller.  It  has  a  big  playroom.  It  has  a  private  bedroom  and  bathroom  for  Jackie —  other  rooms  for  his  mother,  his  uncle,  the  servants  and  Jackie's  bodyguard.  Oh,  yes —  he  has  a  bodyguard.  They're  paying  for  that  house  now,  out  of  that  $2,500-a-month  surplus.   The  rest  of  it?  It's  being  invested  in  govern-  ment bonds.  Also  with  the  approval  of  the  court.   And  of  course  you  know  that  Jackie  gets  only  a  dollar  a  week  for  spending  money.   T_TERE'S  the  routine  of  Jackie's  day — during  •*-  ■*■  those  periods  when  he's  not  working:   He  arises  at  seven  o'clock.  Racket  begins,  and  sleep  is  no  more,  in  that  house.   Usually  he  just  slips  an  old  bathrobe  over  his  pajamas;  sticks  his  feet  into  a  pair  of  bedroom  slippers.  If  he  does  dress,  he  gets  into  a  dirty  old  pair  of  corduroy  pants  and  a  sweater.   He  putters  around  the  bathroom  and  his  bedroom,  with  some  toys  or  his  guns- — what  a  collection  of  "gats"  he  has! — until  eight  o'clock.  That's  breakfast  time.  Cereal,  a  couple  of  eggs,  a  glass  of  milk.   Right  after  breakfast  comes  a  chore.  Piano  lessons.  Jackie  hates  that.  He  thinks  it'd  be  much  more  fun  just  to  sit  down  and  play.  But  he's  a  "good  boy"  and  studies  his  notes  and  does  his  practicing.   Then  at  nine  the  school  teacher  comes.  The  teacher  is  not  paid  out  of  Jackie's  money.  The  studio  pays  for  her,  under  the  California  law.  As  a  pupil,  his  teacher  says,  he's  just  an  aver-  age boy,  neither  fast  nor  slow  to  learn.   Lunch  at  noon.  After  lunch,  Jackie  can  do  as  he  pleases  until  dinner  time.  All  afternoon  for  play.  "Because  I  was  never  allowed  to  play  normally,  like  other  children,  and  I  know  what  it  did  to  me,"  mother  Mabel  Leonard,  ex-  stage-child  explains.   How  does  he  play?  Oh,  much  like  the  aver-  age boy.  Except  that  he  must  be  the  leader  in  whatever  he  and  his  buddies  are  doing.  His  playmates  are  neighborhood  kids,  for  the  most  part.   NOW  and  then  some  other  boy  in  the  "gang,"  resentful  of  Jackie's  determined  leadership,  pokes  the  to-be-expected  jibe  at  him:  "Aw,  just  because  you're  a  movie  big  shot,  you  needn't  think  you're  the  whole  works  around  here!"  When  that  happens,  Jackie  invariably  goes  home.  Usually  he  asks  his  mother:  "Maw,  why  do  they  think  I'm  different  just  because  I'm  in  pictures?"   Jackie  has  one  all-absorbing  passion.     It's    Photoplay  Magazine  for  June,  1933    io5    for  guns.  His  prize  possession  is  a  geniune  German  Luger,  which  he  keeps  in  the  top  drawer  of  the  desk  in  his  room.  But  he  has  others — all  sorts  of  guns — from  rusty  old-time  pistols,  to  bee-bee  guns,  shot-guns,  even  "gats"  carved  out  of  wood.  He  has  holsters  every-  where— even  one  nailed  to  the  hood  of  a  home-  made pushmobile  he's  built.  Much  of  his  play  deals  with  gun  play.   FOR  playthings,  during  his  five-to-six-hour  afternoon  period,  Jackie  has  no  lack,  even  outside  of  guns.  He  has  a  great  collection  of  boats — from  hand-carved  little  "jobs"  to  elaborate  costly  models,  one  of  which  was  the  gift  of  Joan  Crawford.  These  he  floats  in  regattas,  when  he  feels  nautical,  in  the  swim-  ming pool  in  the  Cooper  back  yard.  You  see,  his  toys,  his  play  life,  are  quite  normal.   At  five-thirty,  Jackie  has  to  be  home  to  do  his  homework — the  same  sort  of  homework  public  school  pupils  have  to  do.  Then  dinner.  Jackie's  dinner  is  not  "dieted."  He  eats  just  what  the  others  in  the  house  eat — and  eats  plenty.  Too  much,  in  fact.  Jackie  is  now  growing  so  fast  that  within  two  months  he  out-  grows new  clothing.   After  dinner,  an  hour  or  so  with  the  family.  Then,  at  eight,  to  bed.  His  bedroom  is  in-  terior-decorated in  elaborate  detail  like  the  cabin  of  a  yacht — even  to  the  door-locks,  and  imitation  portholes  with  sea-vistas  painted  be-  hind them.  On  his  desk  are  a  pair  of  star-  board-and-port  ship's  lights,  red  and  green,  which  Jackie  turns  on  with  delight.  Beside  his  bed  is  a  tiny  radio.  When  he  plops  into  bed,  he  turns  this  on — particularly  on  Tuesday  and  Friday  nights.  Those  are  prize-fight  nights  in  Los  Angeles,  and  Jackie  always  listens  to  the  broadcasts  of  the  battles.  Once  in  a  while  he's  allowed  to  go  to  the  fights  with  one  of  his  grown-up  friends.   Usually,  Jackie  falls  asleep  with  the  radio  going.  And  that's  the  end  of  the  Jackie  Cooper  day.   When  he's  working  in  a  picture,  it's  different.  His  studio  day  is  from  nine  until  six.  Between  scenes,  he  has  his  schooling.  He  eats  at  the  studio  lunch- room — usually  with  Wally  Beery  or  Joan  Crawford  or  some  other  star.  Or,  per-  haps with  an  interviewer  from  a  moving  picture  magazine.   He  learns  his  lines  when  working,  at  the  breakfast  table  at  home.  And  at  night,  after  dinner  and  before  bedtime.  He  works  hard.  He  loves  acting,  and  loves  even  the  work  of  acting — like  learning  lines  and  "business"  and  such  details.   Mabel  Leonard  Cooper  has  some  very  definite  ideas  about  shielding  her  son  from  the  influence  of  stardom.  But  often,  these  aims  of  Jackie's  mother  are  naturally  thwarted.  When  he  is  discovered  at  a  movie  show  he  is  sur-  rounded by  a  mob.  Countless  people  shove  cards,  papers  at  him,  demanding  his  auto-  graph. Whether  he  likes  it  or  not  is  a  mystery.  He  tells  his  mother  he  doesn't.  But  that  he  is  conscious  of  his  position  is  demonstrated  by  this  little  incident:   He  asked  Richard  Dix  once  for  an  auto-  graphed picture  for  his  clubroom.  Dix  gave  it  to  him.  Later,  he  complained  to  his  mother:  "Maw,  I  asked  him  for  his  autographed  picture  and  he  gave  it  to  me.  But  he  didn't  ask  me  for  mine  in  return!"   npWO  years  ago,  it  seemed  to  this  writer,  J-  Jackie  was  quite  the  normal  boy.  Every-  thing he  said  or  did  was  normal  boyishness.  Today,  there  is  in  the  things  he  says  and  does  not  so  much  a  sense  of  normalcy  as  there  is  a  flavor  of  acting.  This  writer  feels,  in  short,  that  today  Jackie  Cooper  is  more  acting  the  boy  than  being  the  boy.   But,  after  all,  that's  merely  a  personal  observation.  His  own  mother  herself  doesn't  know  whether  she's  succeeding  in  keeping  him  a  boy  or  not!   "Sometimes  he's  two  years  old.  Sometimes  he's  forty-two.  I  don't  quite  understand  my  own  son,"  she  says.

D.,  124-D  Grove  Ave.,  Woodbridge,  N.  J.    The  Little  Maid  of  w  Cavalcade    9?    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  71  ]    and  a  half  with  mighty  little  encouragement  to  keep  her  chin  up.   Like  the  fairy  story  about  Dick  Whittington  and  his  cat,  Una  O'Connor  soon  found  out  that  the  streets  of  London  town  were  not  paved  with  gold.   And  the  managers  to  whom  she  went  in-  sisted that  she  could  not  be  a  character  actress  at  all,  but  an  ingenue.   She  was  about  to  give  up — had  given  up,  in  fact,  sending  a  telegram  to  her  aunt  that  she  was  coming  home — when  the  seeming  miracle  happened.   TN  Dick  Whittington's  case  he  heard  the  -*-chime  of  Bow  bells,  as  he  was  sitting  forlornly  upon  a  curb  about  to  depart,  telling  him:  "Turn  again,  turn  again,  Dick  Whittington,  thrice  Lord  Mayor  of  London."  Dick,  as  you  know,  did  turn  again,  and  did  become  Lord  Mayor  of  London;  but  in  Una  O'Connor's  case  she  heard  an  agent's  voice  on  the  telephone,  telling  her  that  he  had  a  job  for  her.   For  two  years  Una  and  her  aunt  toured  England.  Ordinarily  a  provincial  touring  company,  instead  of  being  a  stepping  stone  to  the  London  stage,  is  a  barrier  against  it.  But  another  miracle  happened,  and  a  producer  who  had  seen  Una's  work  whisked  her  out  of  the  third-class  railway  carriages  to  the  Kingsway  Theater.   There  she  played  the  role  of  the  prostitute  in  ''Damaged  Goods."   But  just  before  her  triumph,  her  aunt,  the    faithful,  kindly  old  aunt  who  had  toured  con-  stantly with  her,  died.   It  was  at  that  time  that  Miss  O'Connor  almost  entered  a  convent  permanently  as  a  nun.  She  walked  the  streets  with  her  grief;  no  mother  could  have  meant  more  to  her  than  did  that  aunt.   "  But  even  as  I  contemplated  longingly  the  utter  peace  of  a  convent,"  she  explained,  "I  knew  that  it  was  not  my  calling  to  become  a  sister.  I  would  gladly  have  renounced  the  world — and  yet  I  could  not.  I  knew  that  a  little  later,  after  time  had  healed  the  first  shock,  my  yearning  for  the  stage  would  return.  And  once  I  took  that  step  I  could  never  go  back."   "DUT  ever  since  that  time  she  has  made  her  ■'-'periodical  retreats  into  the  solacing  shrines  of  convents  and  emerged  the  better  for  them.   It  was  a  long  time  before  Una  got  her  big  chance.  It  came  when  Noel  Coward,  the  author  of  "Cavalcade,"  who  himself  produced  and  directed  the  play  in  London,  saw  her  and  engaged  her  immediately  for  the  role  she  created.   Naturally,  to  Una,  Noel  Coward  is  a  demi-  god of  the  theater,  standing  head  and  shoulders  above  all  other  playwrights  and  all  other  pro-  ducers at  the  age  of  thirty-six.   And  her  next  ambition  is  to  portray  Americans  just  as  faithfully  as  she  portrayed  the  little  Cockney  maid  in  a  picture  so  essenti-  ally British  as  "Cavalcade."    Tear-Stained  Laughter    CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  41  ]    to  fifteen  dollars  a  week.  While  it  sounded  like  big  money  to  Stan,  he  started  a  nip-and-tuck  race  with  the  well-known  wolf,  with  hotel  bills  and  costumes  to  be  paid  for  out  of  the  insignifi-  cant sum.  For  almost  four  years  Stan  trouped  the  States  in  what  became  well-known  as  "A  Night  in  an  English  Music  Hall."   T\  THEN  the  act  was  disbanded,  Laurel  W  stayed  in  vaudeville  as  a  single.  His  pantomime,  though,  was  over  the  heads  of  the  audiences  in  the  dingy  «houses  that  gave  him  spasmodic  bookings.   The  going  got  tougher,  but  Stan  refused  to  say  quits.   Sudden  cancellation  of  engagements  was  widely  practiced  by  managers  of  that  day,  and  Stan  more  than  once  was  stranded  far  from  New  York,  his  wallet  and  change  pocket  empty.  That  meant  riding  the  rods  back  to  Gotham  for  a  fresh  start.   Oliver  Hardy  was  convinced  the  world  was  his  oyster  when  he  was  called  to  Jacksonville,  Florida,  by  a  film  unit  that  agreed  to  re-  munerate him  at  the  rate  of  $35  a  week.  Most  of  it  went  home  to  his  mother.  Then,  without  warning,  the  company  went  on  the  rocks.   Hardy  was  "strapped"  and  stranded  'way  below  the  Mason-Dixon  line.  He  wired  his  mother  for  the  fare  home.   Stan  Laurel,  after  what  to  him  was  an  ex-  tended run  in  Baltimore,  Philadelphia  and  New  York,  felt  himself  a  Croesus;  he  had  saved  S800.  Aboard  a  train  headed  for  Bing-  hamton,  N.  Y.,  he  found  his  coat  slit  and  his  "fortune"  lifted.   "There  was  nobody  I  could  ask  for  money,"  bewails  Stan,  "and  never  before  or  since  have  I  seen  a  butcher  do  such  a  wholesale  slicing  as  that  one  did  on  my  coat."   He  walked  the  twelve  blocks  to  the  hotel,    only  to  find  that  it  had  no  dining  room — so  he  couldn't  eat  "on  the  cuff."  He  played  two  shows  the  next  day  before  he  could  promote  an  advance  for  a  meal.   And  Oliver  can  tell  you  how,  on  blistered  feet  and  an  empty  stomach  he  trudged  and  crawled  over  fifty  miles  of  Texas  railroad  ties  when  a  road  show  manager  decamped  with  the  receipts  from  a  Lone  Star  State  village.  Two  ham  sandwiches,  bought  with  his  last  dime,  and  raw  onions  and  bread,  donated  by  friendly  railroad  "hunkies,"  were  his  menu  on  his  five-  day  struggle  to  the  nearest  city,  El  Paso,  and  hoped-for  work.   Hoping  union  meant  strength  and  steady  bookings,  Laurel  teamed  up  with  another  vaudevillian  and  his  wife,  but  the  merger  brought  little  improvement  in  his  finances.  Illness,  "at  liberty"  and  an  insistent  tummy  ate  up  the  savings  of  a  year's  work.   "An  immediate  engagement  right  there  in  New  York  was  all  that  saved  the  three  of  us  from  becoming  public  charges,"  Stan  admits.   WHEN  Hollywood  loomed  as  the  film  capi-  tal, Stan  and  Oliver  trekked  westward  via  different  routes.  And  the  jinx  still  stuck  close  to  them.  Hardy  went  with  a  "quickie"  con-  cern, but  most  of  his  pay-checks  contained  more  rubber  than  paper.  Some  of  them  bounced  so  hard  they  still  stick  among  his  souvenirs — they  couldn't  be  pried  loose.  Laurel  stuck  to  producers  of  greater  financial  responsibility,  but  his  "calls"  were  few  and  far  between.   When  Stan  encountered  his  erstwhile  vaude-  ville partners  in  Los  Angeles,  he  raved  in-  cessantly about  the  movies'  future  and  the  enormous  salaries  in  Hollywood.   "You're  foolish  to  stay  on  the  road,"  he  told  them.  "Why,  everybody  out  here  is  getting  rich!"    Photoplay  Magazine  for  June,  1933    107    "Fine!"  they  responded.  "Let's  go  to  sup-  per and  talk  it  over."   "Right-o,"  shot  back  Stan,  "but  you'll  have  to  pay  the  check.  I  haven't  worked  in  five  weeks  and  I'm  flat."   Failing  to  win  recognition  as  a  film  actor,  Stan  turned  to  directing,  first  as  an  assistant,  then  in  command.  Hal  Roach  hired  him  to  direct  four  comedies  in  which  Oliver  Hardy  was  playing  fairly  important  parts.  With  three  of  the  productions  "in  the  can,"  Hardy  suffered  a  severely  burned  hand,  and  Stan  donned  grease  paint  again  to  fill  the  gap  in  the  cast.   ROACH  saw  the  "rushes" — and  yelled  for  Laurel.  "Say,"  shouted  the  producer,  "you're  an  actor  and  don't  know  it!  You're  wasting  your  time  as  a  director!"   "I  quite  agree  with  you,"  answered  Stan,  "but  I  had  to  eat."   Roach  then  made  three  comedies  using  both  Stan  and  Oliver  and  gradually  increasing  the  size  of  their  roles.  The  team  "clicked"  so  hard  with  audiences  (exhibitors  even  billed  them  along  with  big  features)  that  Roach  decided  to  co-star  them  in  "Hats  Off."  That  was  in  1927.   Laurel  and  Hardy  were  "made"!   While  the  last  five  years  have  worked  a  magic  transformation  in  their  surroundings,  Laurel  and  Hardy  have  passed  through  the  metamorphosis  unchanged  and  unspoiled.  True,  stardom  has  made  it  possible  for  them  to  acquire  fine  houses  in  Beverly  Hills,  but  they  are  homes,  not  show  places.  There  are  costly  cars  in  their  garages,  but  they  still  drive  "flivvers."   Their  wearing  apparel  comes  from  more  ex-  clusive shops,  but  the  size  of  their  hatbands  shows  no  increase.   Their  current  cronies  are  the  pals  who  "knew  them  when."   And  Stan  makes  the  startling  claim  that  he  has  never  been  inside  a  Hollywood  night  club!   "Oliver  and  I  have  lived  apart  from  the  rest  of  the  movie  colony,"  he  explains,  "be-  cause the  hardships  of  those  lean  years  made  too  deep  an  impression  on  us  to  let  us  be  wastrels  now."   Stan  is  grateful  for  the  new  order  mainly  because  it  allows  him  to  shower  some  of  life's  luxuries  on  Mrs.  Laurel  and  Lois,  aged  five;  Oliver,  because  Myrtle  Reeves  Hardy,  who  gave  up  her  own  film  future  to  marry  him,  no  longer  has  to  pinch  pennies.   Fishing  and  his  flower  garden  are  Laurel's  only  personal  extravagances.  A  low  golf  score  and  a  good  tailor  fully  satisfy  the  splurging  proclivities  of  Hardy.   The  real  life  Laurel  and  Hardy  stand  out  in  sharp  contrast  to  their  celluloid  characters.  Theater-goers  see  the  dumb-panned  Stan  as  the  abused  victim  of  the  dumb,  yet  self-satis-  fied Oliver.   AWAY  from  the  cameras,  though,  Hardy  seeks  the  background  while  Laurel  takes  the  lead.  Because  he  handles  the  team's  busi-  ness, originates  the  stories  for  their  pictures  and  assists  in  direction,  Stan  draws  five  hun-  dred dollars  a  week  more  than  Oliver.   "And  he's  worth  every  cent  of  the  additional  money,"  Oliver  wants  you  to  know.  "It's  Stan  who  puts  us  over."   Which  provides  the  only  point  on  which  they  don't  agree.   "That's  unfair  to  Oliver,"  Stan  protests,  "without  him  I  wouldn't  have  gotten  anywhere  in  pictures."   Neither  can  be  convinced  that  what  they  call  their  lucky  break  will  continue  forever.   Stan  sees  ahead  of  him  a  new  career  as  a  director  when  his  acting  days  are  over.  Oliver  still  pores  over  his  law  books  and  expects  to  hang  out  his  shingle  when  he  puts  away  his  make-up  box.

She  Even  Laughs  Off  Landslides    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  42  ]    lot  of  troubled  people  and  long  faces,  and  gloom  and  unhappiness.    You're  an  exponent  of  the  theory  that  a  laugh  is  the  most  worthwhile  thing  in  life.  Can  you  reconcile  that  philosophy  with  what  people  are  experiencing?"  "Certainly,"  said  Marion.  "Well,  why  not  tell  them  how?"  "Is  this,"  she  asked,  "an  interview?''  "Uh    huh,"    uh-huhed    your    interviewer.  Marion  laughed.     "Oh,   all  right  then — but  come  down  to  my  beach  house  Sunday  after-  noon.    We  can  talk  better  there."   A  ND  that's  how  it  was  arranged.  About  ■*  ^-herself,  she  would  never  have  talked.  But  appeal  to  her  wish-to-help-others — and  Marion  fell  for  it  like  a — well,  like  that  cliff  outside  her  house  did!   It  was  a  peach  of  an  afternoon — one  of  those  soft,  warm  mild  days  that  brought  people  out  in  thousands.  The  beaches  were  crowded.  Of  course,  Marion's  mammoth  beach  place  is  fenced  off — but  over  the  walls  into  the  Davies  estate  came  the  laughs  and  cries  of  beach-players.  And  at  the  other  side  was  the  towering  red-brown  height  of  the  Santa  Monica  palisades,  one  hundred  and  fifty  feet  high,  of  softish  sandstone — or  "decomposed  granite"  as  it's  more  properly  called   out   there.   Atop  is  a  municipal  park,  and  a  rustic  railing  skirts  the  edge  of  the  cliff,  which  was  always  considered  firm  and  solid.  Naturally,  on  this  sunny  Sunday  afternoon,  many  people  promenaded  up  there,  stopped  and  leaned  on  the  railing  to  look  down  on  the  row  of  movie  stars'  homes  along  the  ocean  shore.   Marion  was  on  the  tennis  court,  playing  a  game  with  another  girl,  when  your  interviewer  arrived.  The  very  h'English  butler  showed  the  way.  Marion  was  in  that  distinctive  shade  of  blue — "  Davies  blue"  the  modistes  now  call  it  — in  slacks.  Between  wallops  at  the  tennis  ball  Marion  hailed:   "Oh,  h'lo!  Be  with  you  in  a  moment.  Don't  mind  if  we  finish  this  game,  do  you?"  While  she  and  her  opponent  finished  what  they  quaintly  called  a  tennis  game,  your  inter-  viewer marveled  at  the  estate — the  colossal  swimming  pool  with  the  Venetian  bridge  over  the  middle  of  it;  the  white-marble  ocean  facade  of  the  huge  house,  big  enough  to  be  a  beach  club;  the  kennelful  of  assorted  dogs  that  Marion  loves  so — and  most  of  all,  Gandhi.   GHANDI  is  a  bandy-legged  dachshund  who  is  morose  when  he  isn't  at  Marion's  side,  who  growls  and  barks  at  everybody  who  ap-  proaches her,  who  will  have  nothing  at  all  to  do  with  strangers.  And  by  the  time  Ghandi  had  growled  his  opinion  of  interviewers,  Marion  was  ready.   "Let's  go  inside,"  said  Marion.  So  we  did,  leaving  several  other  guests  playing  tennis.   Well,  once  in  the  library  for  the  interview,  all  Marion's  self-assurance  left  her.  She  was  like  a  little  kid,  scared  to  death.  Odd,  isn't  it,  that  this  girl  who  has  position,  wealth,  fame,  who  is  accustomed  to  mingling  with  many  of  the  world's  greatest  and  most  im-  portant figures,  should  go  to  pieces  before  an  interviewer?  Her  tongue  constantly  got  all  tangled  up  with  her  syllables.  Yet  she  de-  clined to  cover  up  her  nervousness  with  the  patently  artificial  poise  and  air  of  condescen-  sion to  which  so  many  other  stars  resort.  Marion  gives  one  the  impression  of  being  just  "the  li'l  girl  next  door."   "Now,  what  about  this  'laugh'  business?"  started  the  talk.   "Well,  it  is  the  most  worthwhile  thing  in  life.    Isn't  it?"   "I'm  interviewing  you.  Not  you  me,"  she  was  reminded.   "I  mean — that's  what  I  think — er,  — uh — "    she  got  confused.  Then  she  warmed  to  the  subject,  and  began  explaining.   "After  all,  we're  put  here  on  this  world  for  some  purpose  we  certainly  know  nothing  about.  But  it  must  be  for  something  good  and  fine  and — that.  So  why  take  it  with  gloom,  and  a  frown,  and  complaints?  Why  not,  for  the  time  we  have  here,  give  to  our-  selves and  to  others  the  benefit  of  cheer,  of  laughter?   "Unselfishly,  we  owe  it  to  others  not  to  add  unhappiness  to  life.  Selfishly,  we're  cheating  ourselves  of  so  much  when  we  cheat  ourselves  of  laughter.   "TT'S  fine  medicine,  for  one  thing.    I've  seen   -'-plenty  of  misery  in  my  life — I've  seen  other  people  in  circumstances  that  looked  black.  And  I've  seen  that  those  who  found  the  heart  to  laugh  were  the  ones  who  came  through.  Those  who  gloomed,  merely  accentuated  their  miseries — and  suffered  much,  much  more.   "I  know  it  takes  courage  to  find  a  laugh  when  the  cards  seem  stacked  against  you —  but  it's  just  using  that  courage  that  helps,  you  see.  It  isn't  just  the  laugh  alone — that  would  be  a  hollow  gesture! — but  it's  what's  behind  the  laugh,  what  the  laugh  stands  for.  That's  what  makes  living  worthwhile."   "But  Marion,"  your  interviewer  stuck  in  his  two-cents'  worth,  "isn't  it  all  very  easy  for  you,  with  wealth  and  fame  and  everything  one  might  wish  for,  to  say  that  laughter  is  the  only  thing  that  counts?  Suppose — suppose  something  should  happen  to  you,  your  beauty,  so  your  screen  career  should  end.  Suppose  you'd  lose  all  this — everything.  Do  you  think  you  could  still  laugh?"   Instantly:   "Certainly!  I  know  I  could — because  I  have.  I've  known  unhappiness  and  poverty  and  all  those  things — and  even  then,  I  found  I  could  laugh.  Because  there's  so  much  in  life  to  give  us  happiness  and  laughter.  Wealth  and  fame  and  position  won't — they  make  life  easier,  perhaps,  but  they  don't  supply  laughter.  On  the  contrary,  without  laughter,  wealth  and  all  that  would  mean  absolutely  zero."   "But,  Marion,  what  you  say  is  all  right  when  living  on  the  plane  of  a  movie  star.  What  about  Mary  Jane,  or  Mrs.  John  Smith,  when  little  things  go  wrong?"   "Well,  laughter,  above  all,  would  help.  I  know  the  little  annoyances  of  life.  I  know  how  malicious  gossip  about  one  can  hurt,  appear  tremendously  important.  I  know  how  easy  it  is  for  a  young  wife  to  hear  gossip  that  her  husband  is  two-timing,  stepping  out  on  her.   "But,  after  all,  what  better  weapon  against  these  things  than  laughter?  To  take  such  things  seriously,  to  worry  about  them,  to  let  them  get  under  your  skin — that  magnifies  such  matters.  But  the  woman  who  can  meet  malicious  gossip,  scandal  about  her  husband,  with  a  laugh,  is  the  woman  who  kills  that  gossip  and  scandal.  Laughter  is  her  surest  weapon  against  it!   "T'M  not  insensible  that  death  and  very  -'■serious  illness  are  exceptions.  We  can't  ex-  pect anyone  to  laugh  in  such  crises — but  at  the  other  extreme,  is  it  fair  to  go  too  far  in  the  other  direction?  It's  not  easy,  but  isn't  it  far  fairer  to  ourselves,  to  others,  even  to  the  memory  of  the  one  who's  gone,  to  assure  our-  selves that  death  is,  as  we  must  believe,  the  doorway  to  a  something  finer,  happier?"  She  was  silent  a  moment.  Then:  "I  hope  this  all  doesn't  sound  too  pollyanna-  ish,"  she  said.  "I  hate,  like  everyone  else,  professional  pollyanna-ing.  What  I'm  saying,  I  hope  will  be  taken  in  the  spirit  I'm  trying  to  express  it — practical  happiness,  not  just  'glad'  mouthings.     I  mean  it.     I  practise  it.    Photoplay  Magazine  for  June,  1933    09    I  think  almost  anybody,  no  matter  who  or  what  the  circumstances,  will  find  life  more  worthwhile   if   the  courage  can   be  found   to   laugh."   TT  was  right  here  that  cries  came  through  the  ■'•windows — then  a  rumbling  and  a  roar.  More  cries.  In  a  moment,  the  sirens  of  police  motor-  cycles. .  .  .   "Something's  happened!" — and  Marion  was  up  and  out  of  the  room.  In  the  hallway,  the  h'English  butler  was  dashing  for  the  pantry  telephone.  "The  'ill's  fell  down,"  he  gasped  to  Marion  as  he  puffed  by  to  call  the  police.  The  tennis  players  had  left  the  courts  to  help  dig  out  two  people  whose  arms  and  legs  protruded  from  the  huge  pile  of  dirt  that  had  rolled  to  within  a  few  feet  of  the  Davies  front  gateway.  In  a  moment,  the  two  people — a  man  and  a  woman — were  being  half  carried  into  the  Davies  house.  Outside,  police  had  arrived,  were  digging  lest  more  victims  be  buried.   Inside,  the  couple  caught  their  breath.  Stimulants  were  found.  They  trembled — tried  to  tell  the  story  of  what  had  happened.  It  seemed  they  were  standing  at  the  palisades  edge,  watching  the  tennis  game  in  the  Davies  courtyard.  The  players  had  noticed  the  pre-  liminary slipping  of  sand  and  gravel  down  the  cliff.  They  had  waved  and  shouted  from  the  courtyard  to  the  people  up  above.  But  these  two  had  misunderstood.   "We  thought  you  folks  were  waving  at  us,  and  we  leaned  to  wave  back  at  you,"  said  the  doctor.    "Just  then  came  the  slide.  .  .  .   "I  thought  it  was  an  earthquake.  I  felt  the  cliff  collapse  under  me.  I  had  just  tried  to  grab  my  wife,  when  it  all  went  down.  I  thought  'this  is  the  end' — that  is  all  I  remember."   HIS  nerves  were  breaking.  So  were  his  wife's.  They  could  not  hold  the  glasses  that  were  pressed  to  their  lips.  Covered  with  dirt,  their  faces  streaked,  bruised,  scratched,  they  did  not  know  how  badly  they  were  hurt.   It  was  then  that  Marion,  instinctively,  stepped  into  the  situation.  She'd  been  talking  soothingly  to  the  woman,  but  it  had  not  helped.  Their  nerves  were  cracking.  And  sud-  denly, in  a  quiet  second,  Marion's  voice  cracked  through:   "Well,  anyway,  it  was  awfully  nice  of  you  people  to  drop  in  on  mc  like  this!"   There  was  a  shocked  silence.  It  seemed  odd  that  anyone  should  wisecrack  at  a  moment  like  this.  But  then  the  doctor  grinned.  So  did  his  wife.  They  forgot  their  shock,  their  nerves.  And  from  inside  him,  the  doctor  found  the  courage  to  send  a  laugh  right  back,  "Yes — but  next  time,  we  won't  take  the  same  short  cut!  We'll  come  the  long  way  around!"   It  broke  the  tension.  They  all  laughed.

He  came  back  from  the  phone  with  another  gag — gruesome  perhaps — "My  city  editor  says  it'd  make  a  better  story  if  we  could  kill  a  couple  of  people  instead  of  just  scratching  them."  They  even  laughed  at  that.   Well,  that's  about  all  there  is  to  the  story.  By  the  time  the  victims  left  for  home,  they  were  quite  cheerful.

So  we  just  laughed.    Saved  By  A  Hunch    [  CONTINUED  FROM  PAGE  57    making  'Bird  of  Paradise.'  I  had  to  fight  under  water  with  a  turtle  weighing  three  hundred  pounds.  The  old  fellow  had  immense  strength.  I  did  the  scene  three  times.  Then  the  director  said  perhaps  we  could  do  it  better  if  we  took  it  once  more.   "Something  as  clear  as  my  own  voice  said  to  me,  'Don't  do  it.'  You  hate  reneging  at  a  time  like  that.  People  are  likely  to  say  you  are  yellow,  but  that  voice  was  too  persistent.  I  told  the  director  I  would  not  take  the  scene  again.   "If  it  must  be  shot  over,  he  would  have  to  get  a  double.   "  A  DOUBLE  was  secured,  the  scene  taken,  ■**■  and  the  double  nearly  lost  his  life.  He  got  caught  under  the  forearm  of  the  huge  turtle  and  could  not  extricate  himself.  The  crew  finally  got  him  loose  but  had  difficulty  in  saving  him.   "I  know  that  my  hunch  was  the  only  thing  that  saved  me.   "And  about  stories,  do  you  remember  that  everyone  with  authority  in  the  matter  seemed  determined  that  I  should  play  'Tess  of  the  Storm  Country'  with  Janet  Gaynor?  From  the  very  first,  I  had  a  hunch  that  that  story  was  not  for  me.  I  was  so  positive  about  it  that  I  argued  my  own  studio,  the  Fox  studio,  and  all  my  personal  friends  out  of  the  notion.  You  see  how  it  turned  out.  Charlie  Farrell,  in  the  same  part,  was  so  unhappy  over  the  outcome  that  he  decided  he  could  not  con-  tinue playing  such  roles,  and  asked  to  be  re-  leased  from  his  contract."   There  are  a  number  of  players  who  feel  that  their  hunches  have  guided  them  at  every  turn  of  their  professional  lives.   As  witness,  Lee  Tracy.  Against  the  advice  of  every  friend  he  had,  Lee  signed  a  contract  for  the  stage  production  of  "Roaring  Forties,"  which  later,  under  the  name  of  "Broadway,"  carried  him  to  fame  and  Hollywood.  He'd  do  almost  anything  now  that  his  hunch  dic-  tates.   When  Carole  Lombard  gets  a  hunch  about  a  story,  she  stands  pat.   Even  the  studio  admits  that  the  few  mis-  takes in  Carole's  career  could  have  been  avoided  if  she  had  been  allowed  to  follow  her  hunches.   JOAN  BLONDELL  has  had  many  uncanny  experiences  with  regard  to  premonitions.  Since  she  was  a  child,  Joan  has  been  saved  a  number  of  times  from  serious  accidents  by  listening  to  something  which  said,  "don't."   The  same  applies  to  her  work.  She  has  heeded  her  hunch,  time  and  again,  and  signed  contracts  which  everyone  thought  would  be  professional  suicide.  She's  doing  all  right  so  far,  thank  you.   "The  best  hunch  I  ever  had  was  to  marry  George   Barnes,"   she   said.   "Too  early  to  get  the  results  on  that,"  I  answered.  "I'll  interview  you  again  ten  years  from  now."   When  I  asked  Madge  Evans  about  it,  I  found  she  has  a  positive  reverence  for  that  "inner  voice."   "I  never  call  them  hunches,"  she  said.  "That     doesn't     seem     important     enough.    Whether  they  are  spiritual  leadings  or  not,  I  cannot  say,  but  before  I  was  born  my  mother  was  always  guided  by  her  powerful  intuitions.   "I  had  a  powerful  hunch  about  my  M-G-M  contract.  I  rejected  an  offer  from  Paramount  before  M-G-M  had  even  made  me  a  proposi-  tion. I  said,  'If  Metro  does  not  offer  me  a  contract,  I  shall  not  go  in  pictures  this  year.'  I  felt  my  place  was  with  them,  and  so  it  has  proved."   Mervyn  LeRoy,  the  director,  looks  like  a  juvenile  leading  man  and  talks  with  the  wis-  dom of  middle  age.   He's  the  brilliant  fellow  who  made  "Little  Caesar"  and  "I'm  a  Fugitive  From  a  Chain  Gang."   "Nobody  pays  more  attention  to  their  hunches  than  I  do,"  he  told  me.  "I  have  no  explanations  to  offer,  but  I  wouldn't  think  of  ignoring  such  warnings  as  come.   "fAXE  specific  instance  of  where  it  saved  my  ^ — 'life  took  place  in  San  Francisco  some  years  ago.  I  was  living  there  at  the  time  and  always  took  the  front  car  of  the  train  which  meets  the  ferry  to  Oakland,  because  I  wanted  to  see  everything.   "One  night  I  had  taken  my  seat  in  the  front  car  of  the  train  as  usual  when  suddenly  I  knew  I  must  not  remain  seated  there  another  minute.   "It  was  such  a  strong  conviction  that  I  grabbed  my  coat  and  almost  ran  to  the  other  extreme  of  the  train.   "I  had  scarcely  gotten  seated  when  the  front  cars  left  the  track  and  were  completely  wrecked.   "The  same  applies  to  my  studio  work.  When  I  read  a  story,  I  get  a  feel  as  to  whether  it  is  the  picture  for  me  to  make  or  not.  Fre-  quently, 1  insist  upon  making  a  story  that  the  producer  is  not  enthusiastic  about.  If  my  hunch  says  it's  good,  I  stick  by  my  guns.  In  the  case  of  'I'm  a  Fugitive,'  three  directors  had  turned  down  the  story  before  I  read  it.  As  soon  as  I  got  hold  of  it,  I  knew,  intuitively,  it  was  my  story  and  begged  to  be  allowed  to  make  it."   There  are  so  many  other  players  who  have  experienced  hunches  that  saved  them  from  physical  and  professional  harm,  there  isn't  room  to  list  them  all.   But  it  takes  the  exception  to  prove  the  rule,  and  our  exception  in  this  case  is  none  other  than  that  most  fascinating  of  Frenchmen,  Maurice   Chevalier.   "Mais  non,  non,  rum"  he  protested  in  answer  to  our  question  about  hunches,  sixth  senses,  premonitions,  etc.   "T  HAVE  not  developed  a  sixth  sense  at  all.  J-  No  'honch'  has  ever  helped  me  out  of  a  difficulty.   "Once  or  twice  I  have  felt  that  I  should  not  do  a  certain  thing,  but  I  have  done  it.  And  it  turned  out  swell.   "I  had  a  very  strong  conviction  that  I  should  not  come  to  America.  I  simply  knew  that  the  American  people  would  not  care  for  my  broken  English.   "I  made  myself  come  over  here,  and  now  you  see,  again  it  has  turned  out  swell."   So  folks,  take  your  choice.

Griffith  had  started  it  with  his  "Birth  of  a  Nation"  and  "Hearts  of  the  World" — and  the  age  of  super-  spectacles  and  super-stars  was  due  to  dawn.   As  our  contribution  we  told  what  we  thought  would  make  stars  eligible.  Mary  Pickford  headed  our  list,  because  best  able  to  make  likeable  roles  live,  while  Doug  Fairbanks  headed  the  list  of  stars  who  did  well  with  good  but  not  subtle  parts.  Of  all  those  studied,  only  these  two  and  Charlie  Chaplin  are  still  in  the  public  eye.  Every  interpreter  of  "real  life"  and  tragic  emotion  has  gone.  We  guessed  that  and  said  why,  about  some  "imports"  from  grand  opera  and  the  stage,  such  as  Mary  Garden  and  Maxine  Elliott.  And  we  predicted  that  Theda  Barism  would  have  to  change  mightily,  too.    Carmel   Myers    Among  newer  players,  we  commended  Milton  Sills  and  had  an  article  telling  how  he  had  wanted  to  be  a  college  professor.  Carmel  Myers  had  just  clicked,  so  we  revealed  how  she  first  drew  notice.  She  was  playing  a  hard,  gum-chewing  waitress  —  and  added  the  business  of  pulling  the  gum.  Billie  Burke  was  in  with  her  new  baby,  and  elsewhere  we  told  how  she  gave  the  Red  Cross  some  forty  dollars  in  small  coins  sent  by  children  for  her  photo-  graphs and  autographs.  Those  were  the  days  of  fervent  hunts  for  German  spies  and  German  propaganda — and  many  of  our  readers  wrote  of  "discoveries"  in  the  films.  We  thought  the  government  able  to  tend  to  that,  and  were  warring  instead  on  smut  in  films.  However,  of  all  the  thirty-  nine  pictures  reviewed,  only  five  drew  fire.   As  a  last  word  on  the  "new  art"  scheduled  for  the  movies,  we  hailed  Director  Maurice  Tourneur.     Olive  Tell  on  the  cover.    10  Years  Ago    IN  June,  1923,  we  revealed  an  odd  fact  about  the  hit  of  the  year — "The  Covered  Wagon."  It  started  life  as  a  simple  West-  ern; but  after  the  outdoor  shots  had  been  taken,  Director  James  Cruze  and  others  realized  that  the  long  train  of  wagons  winding  West  had  gripping  appeal,  and  expanded  the  film  to  the  classic  it  proved.   And 'what  a  group  of  "cos-  tumes" and  "historicals"  was  in  the  making,  now  that  public  taste  had  set  that  way!  Mary  Pickford  in  "Rosita";  Charles  Ray  in  "The  Courtship  of  Miles  Standish";  "Scaramouche,"  with  Ramon  Novarro  and  Alice  Terry;  to  mention  a  few.  Incidentally,  Rex  Ingram  told  how  he  "discovered"  Novarro,  Alice  Terry  and  Rudolph  Valentino  (who  was  still  off-screen,  because  he  objected  to  his  roles') .   Among  news  of  players,  a  landmark  was  our  telling  what  had  become  of  that  great  serial  favorite,  Pearl  White.    Success-weary,  she  had    Pearl  White    taken  refuge  in  a  convent  some-  where in  Europe,  there  to  seek  the  peace  and  contentment  which  her  world-wide  acclaim  had  tended  more  to  destroy  than  supply.  And  a  fine  picture  re-  minded us  that  another  star  was  soon  to  pass — Strongheart,  first  of  dog  stars.   Of  newcomers,  perhaps  Anna   May   Wong  led   the   list.      Our   account  revealed   that  she  had   never  been  to  China,  and  that   her  father  still  had  his  business   nearby.   Reginald    Denny   had   achieved    notice    in   "The  Leatherpusher"  series.  Dick  Barthelmess   was    happy    over    a  new     "find" — Dorothy   Mackaill ;  and  we  showed  him.   Pola  Negri's  first  American  picture —  "Bella  Donna" — was  reviewed,  and  we  said  they'd  tamed  Pola  too  much.  But  we  hailed  that  classic  comic,  Harold  Lloyd's  "Safety  Last!"  Doug  Fairbanks,  Jr.  was  preparing  his  screen  debut.    The  cover — May  McAvoy.    5  Years  Ago    TRULY  the  Golden  Age  of  Hollywood  was  in  full  bloom  in  June,  1928!  It  cost  8100,000  no  less,  and  often  more — to  woo  and  marry  a  baby  star.  Ruth  Taylor   furnished   particulars.   Mack  Sennett  was  tearing  down  his  famous  old  studio —  the  one  that  had  nurtured  Charlie  Chaplin,  Gloria  Swan-  son,  Mabel  Normand,  Ben  Turpin,  and  many  others — as  no  longer  useful;  and  Tom  Mix  was  telling  about  making  his  first  million.  Millions  seemed  commoner  than  mortgages  are  these  days.  As  appropriate  setting  to  all  this  the  scin-  tillant  Greta  Garbo,  finishing  her  auto-  biography for  us,  told  of  her  landing,  unknown,  in  New  York  City  just  three  years  before,  and  of  staying  in  a  dingy  hotel  for  two  months,  prior  to  reporting  for  duty  in  Hollywood.  (Imagine  her  being  able  to  do  that  now!)  She  told  also  of  how  it  eased  her  bewilderment  to    Mary  Pickford    find  opposite  her  in  "Flesh  and  the  Devil,'2     Davies  on  the  cover    her  second  picture,  an  inspiring  actor  named  John  Gilbert — and  as  an  accompanying  note,  Jack  started  his  autobiography  for  us  that  month.   There  were  gray  notes,  how-  ever, among  the  glitter.  Mary  Pickford  and  Doug,  we  told,  had  just  sailed  for  Europe,  fol-  lowing the  death  of  Mary's  mother,  April  21.  Pola  Negri,  whose  advent  we  had  hailed  five  years  before,  was  breaking  up  her  two  Western  homes,  having  abandoned  further  picture  activ-  ity; and  yet  with  it  all,  the  burning,  throbbing  question  of  the  day  seemed  to  be,  "Would  Mary,  or  would  she  not,  bob  her  hair?"   Doug  Jr.,  whose  debut  was  foreshadowed  five  years  before,  was  shown  playing  tennis  with  Joan  Crawford,  and  a  marriage  was  in  prospect  for  the  fall.  George  Belden,_  bit  player  in  Westerns,  replaced  a  dismissed  cctor,  and  was  renamed  Rex  Bell.     Marion    Addresses    Hollywood,  Calif.

Cal  York's  Monthly  Broadcast  from  Hollywood    CONTINUED  FROM   PAGE  92    "  f~\H,  no  I'm  not  superstitious,"  Marlcne  ^^Dietrich  confided.  "Not  a  bit."  And  then,  almost  in  the  same  breath,  she  spoke  of  her  reasons  for  liking  America.  "My  little  girl  likes  it.  She  is  so  healthy  here."  And  immediately  Marlene  leaned  over  and  tapped  on  wood  three  times.   A  ND  there  is  that  nifty  one  which  "^^Estelle  Taylor  relates.  She  was  teaching  the  alphabet  to  her  niece.   "And  what  comes  after  O?"  Estelle  inquired.   "Yeah!"  replied  the  tiny  niece.   T*\IANA  WYNYARD  was  making  a  scene  "^"'ior  " Reunion  In  Vienna. "  She  had  been  lying  in  bed  for  one  entire  day  for  that  one  scene.  Barrett  Kiesling,  publicity  man,  walked  onto  the  set;  approached  her.   "What  a  cinch  you  have  lying  in  bed  all  day!"   "  You're  the  fifteenth  fellow  to  say  that  to  me  today.  Supposing  you  try  lying  in  bed  all  day  on  one  side.  Not  allowed  to  move  an  inch  for  fear  of  getting  out  of  the  camera  angle  and  spoiling  a  shot.  Not  allowed  to  move  a  leg  for  fear  of  wrinkling  a  sheet  so  that  the  wrinkles  in  this  take  wouldn't  be  like  those  in  the  last.  You  can't  twist  your  head  for  fear  of  upsetting  the  pillow.  Just  you  try  lying  in  bed  for  a  camera! "    TOURING  the  bank  holiday,  George  Arliss  paid  Jenner,  his  valet,  in  cash.  "There  you  are,  Jenner,"  he  said,  "probably  at  this  moment  the  richest  man  in  Hollywood."   JVTANCY  SMITH,  press-agent  for  some  of  Hollywood's  most  famous,  went  to  Sears,  Roebuck  to  buy  some  little  sleeping  gar-  ments for  her  grandson,  Dorothy  Dwan's  child.  Dorothy  asked  her  mother  to  return  them.  She  was  afraid  the  child  might  hurt  himself  on  the  buttons.  The  saleswoman  snorted:  "You  don't  need  to  be  afraid.  I  sold  Connie  Ben-  nett a  dozen  for  her  little  boy  just  before  she  went  to  Europe!"   "pVER  hear  of  the  soup  supper?     Well,  it's  the  latest  fad  in  Hollywood.    Helen  Twelve-  trees  started  it  by  asking  her  friends  to  a  Sun-  day night  buffet  soup  supper.   The  guests  were  led  before  three  steaming  tureens  of  hot  soup,  one  rice  and  chicken  broth,  another  meat  and  vegetable  soup  and  one  French  onion  with  rounds  of  toast  and  grated  cheese  shaken  over  it,  and  told  to  help  them-  selves. Sandwiches  of  all  kinds  were  also  served  with  the  soup.   TACK  OAKIE  and  Peggy  Hopkins  Joyce  had  J  a  date  and  Peggy,  as  usual,  was  late.  Jack  paced  up  and  down,  waiting  for  Peggy.     At    last,  very,  very  late,  Peggy  arrived.   "Wait  here,"  Jack  said  and  dashed  out.  Fifteen  minutes  later,  he  returned  with  a  huge  dollar  watch  which  he  proceeded  to  tie  on  the  amazed  Peggy's  wrist.   "Now  let's  go,"  Jack  said,  "and  be  on  time,  next  time. "   Off  they  went,  the  watch  dangling  from  Peggy's  arm.   "D  OBERT  YOUNG,  M-G-M  leading  man,  married  Betty  Lou  Henderson,  his  High  School  sweetheart,  in  Santa  Ana.  "The  cere-  mony will  be  a  cinch  for  me, "  Bob  kept  telling  the  future  Mrs.  Young,  "for,  you  see,  I'm  ex-  perienced at  repeating  lines."   So  the  ceremony  began  and  Bob  commenced  floundering  about  saying  "With  this  wing  I  thee  red,"  until  it  took  both  the  bride  and  the  minister  to  get  him  straightened  out.
